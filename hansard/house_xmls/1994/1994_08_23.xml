         The funds concerned will be made available under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. This program was introduced in 1990 and underpins the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP. Funding for this program is presently appropriated on a triennial basis with the second triennium covering the years 1993 to 1995. The Commonwealth remains committed to the AEP, which addresses the inequality of educational opportunities and outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people.

         During 1993 the Commonwealth government, with the agreement of all state and territory governments, commenced a national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The national review has been asked to examine whether or not the strategies developed over the first three years of the AEP have been effective and to suggest some new strategic directions where these might be required.

         This bill provides for the appropriation of $84.131 million in 1995 and $256,000 in 1996. The 1995 funding level represents an increase of $212,000 on the amount currently specified in the principal act. The amount appropriated for 1996 reflects the amount of funds to be transferred from the Higher Education Funding Act. Legislation will be introduced at a later stage to increase that amount to reflect the appropriate base level of funding which should apply in 1996 and later years. I commend the bill to the House.

         —I rise to speak on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1994. From the outset can I say that the coalition fully supports this bill and fully supports the funding of education for Aboriginal Australians. Nevertheless, as the opposition, we want to raise some issues about this area of government administration. To a significant extent any debate about education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is also a debate about much broader issues. The coalition believes that education is fundamental to relieving social disadvantage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the areas of housing, health and employment opportunities, as well as improving social justice and bringing about reconciliation.

         Many of us in this place are aware that governments essentially have two levers that they can use: one is financial help to Australians and the distribution of resources in that way; and the other is education. The coalition is fully supportive of funding Aboriginal education as proposed in this bill. However, the current social indicators in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are clear testimony to the fact that Labor policies of the last decade—with their focus on land rights, a treaty and funding communities rather than individuals and families—have not worked. We have to remember that the social disadvantage which still exists in this country in the area of Aboriginal affairs is after 11 years of a federal Labor government.

         As the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody identified, education has the power to bring about political, social and  economic change for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Whether the problem is sanitation, community or domestic violence, primary health needs, alcoholism, family breakdown, law and order or petrol sniffing, education is the most important process available to governments to bring about a medium to long-term change. I think all Australians are deeply desirous that that change be brought about. I hope this sort of funding may help some way towards achieving that goal.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The royal commission also recognised the debilitating effect the lack of training and education had on employment opportunities. The consequence is that many Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders find it extremely difficult to have any economic power. Huge levels of funding have been put into this area—about $10 billion over the last 20 years. Over the past few years a substantial amount of money has also been put into Aboriginal education.

         However, I am concerned that the educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have not improved in proportion to the money being spent. Many people on both sides of the House, not just on our side, would be concerned about that. There has been some improvement—I acknowledge and welcome it—but, given the millions of dollars spent over the last decade, we should be seeing a far more dramatic improvement in the educational outcomes and social indicators within our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

         Approximately $160 million has been allocated for the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1995. This bill will appropriate another $85.387 million to AESIP largely for the period 1 January 1995 to 30 June 1996. While the base level of funding from January 1996 to June 1997 has not yet been appropriated, we will be looking at an expenditure of $330 million or so on just this program from 1993 to 1997.

         When this amount of money is being expended in this area, there is a great need to have very clear quantitative performance indicators. I stress how important it is to ensure that the money which is allocated actually achieves the outcomes that all of us would desire. With this amount of money being spent on Aboriginal education, as well as around $350 million per year in special allocations for Aboriginal education to higher education institutions and $150.5 million funding directly to students and their families through Abstudy, tutorial assistance and vocational and educational guidance, one could expect some dramatic improvements in the participation rates, retention rates and educational achievement of Aboriginal students. Sadly, this is not the case. Once again, it seems that the federal Labor Party is throwing substantial amounts of money at Aboriginal education, but it is not getting to the right people or to the right areas so as to make a significant difference to the proportion that is needed in the field of education.

        The Hughes report focused on four key areas which the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy also endorsed: to increase the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in educational decision making; to strive to achieve equality of access to educational services; to strive to achieve equality of educational participation; and to strive for equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. I will certainly be making further reference to that last point a little later.

         No-one would question that these are vital areas in the improvement of Aboriginal education. However, it is now four years since AEP came into effect.

         Unfortunately, the statistics from the 1994 national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are an indictment of the government in the way that money has been thrown at the problem but to little avail. The 1994 national review has provided considerable evidence that, despite some improvements—we welcome those improvements; I also acknowledge that it is a difficult area—in the educational participation and retention rates of Aboriginal Australians over the last four years, there is still reason for considerable concern that greater progress has not been made. There is a lot of distance to cover before equity will be attained.

         Most Australian children attend preschool as four-year-olds. The 1994 review shows that the gap in the preschool participation rate between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and other Australian four-year-olds almost halved between 1986 and 1991. However, the level still remains at 9.5 per cent lower than the 58 per cent for other Australians who attend preschool.

         In the rural areas the situation is worse than in the cities and towns, with participation rates for preschool Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders being considerably less than for their urban counterparts. Less than 80 per cent of five-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children living in small communities of 200 people or less are apparently enrolled in a school or preschool. It is alarming that 13.2 per cent of five-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are apparently not participating in any form of education, compared with 5.9 per cent of other Australian five-year-olds. They are therefore later to start school generally than other Australian children.

         Primary school participation rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children still remain lower than for other Australians, but the vast majority—95 per cent of them—will begin and complete primary school. I hope that, as time goes on in this great country of ours, that will bring benefits to the country and hopefully those children will stay on through high school. However, again there is a reason for deep concern with regard to achievement. Whereas 16 per cent of other Australian children have significantly lower levels of achievement in literacy and numeracy than the average, a huge 45 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have significantly lower levels of achievement in these areas. What we have to recognise as Australians is that these are fundamental skills for participating in the world today.

         The huge pool of money is simply not providing the resources for or meeting the needs of these children. Of this $84 million that the government is now appropriating for the January 1995 to June 1996 period, what guarantee can the government give that the money will actually reach and benefit the young people of Australia? This is where we have to ensure that it is the outcomes from the use of this money that are important to us. What these children with learning problems need is more teachers on the ground—a better teacher-student ratio—so that time and effort can be spent in order to address the learning difficulties of these children.

         Furthermore, it is one thing to try to improve retention rates, as we should, but it is another to monitor the course skills to determine what level of work is actually being done. Many Aboriginal students are in high school doing work at the basic primary level. I have talked to some primary teachers and principals in some areas which have a large population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Their concern, as one person said to me, was `Yes, we do have our students here. They are 15- and 16-year-olds, but the real problem for Australia is that they are still doing grade three work.'

How much progress have we really made in this area a year or so later? Has there been some incremental change or not? Does the parliament know?

         Another important national priority, the minister said, was implementing a national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy, which began in January 1993. This was about providing special languages other than English in Aboriginal schools. I ask the government and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table: how many schools is this program being taught in? How many children are benefiting from this program? What are the languages which are being taught?

         The third point was about national reconciliation and schooling strategy and that there was a role there. Minister Beazley said last year that it was vital to enable advancement in harmonious relationships, so the funding of the money was there to encourage an advancement in our educational institutions. I fully support that and so does the coalition. He went on to say that it would be for all levels of education. Again, what is the nature of the material that is being developed?

         Fourthly, the minister referred to a comparable exercise for teacher pre-service training and the sister school scheme which was launched in 1992 and which aims to encourage contact between students of predominantly non-Aboriginal schools and students in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schools. I would be interested to know how many of those exchange schools actually exist under the sister school scheme. Is it working well? Is it effective? How is it going?

         At the tertiary level the picture is slightly more optimistic. This is encouraging because five or six years ago very few Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were reaching tertiary education; but this is most encouraging. In fact, participation rates for the age group 16 to 24 are higher than those for other Australians. Also, although Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have lower university participation rates than other Australians, the numbers involved doubled in the period from 1988 to 1993. I say to the minister: I really do welcome that, having been a former shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, and for Australia that can be seen as exciting.

         The number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander graduates is steadily increasing and let us hope it continues to increase. Despite these modest improvements the general picture for the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students is still bleak. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy—AEP—sought to achieve equity in educational participation. These statistics indicate that we are still a long way from that goal. The AEP also sought to achieve equality of access to educational services but the 1994 review shows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in rural areas and especially in the remote areas of Australia are severely disadvantaged in regard to access to education, and the gaps are getting wider between urban and rural participation in post-compulsory education. The government has also ignored many other Australians in rural and remote areas of Australia in regard to educational access over the last decade.

         Through my speech I have highlighted just a few of the educational statistics. The social indicators also show that the health, housing and unemployment situation of Aboriginals has not changed significantly throughout the government's 11-year effort in this area. Currently, the transition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to the labour market is abysmal. These people continue to experience lower rates of employment—in fact, 38 per cent of 20- to 24-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are outside the labour market. Is this funding going to bring about the change we so desperately need? It is clear that the government must be more accurate in targeting the specific areas of need and the most effective ways of spending taxpayers' dollars in order to alleviate the educational disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

We support the funding but, under this government's administration, is the money really achieving the outcomes that all of us desire? I do not believe it is. It is very important that we achieve these educational outcomes where it will make a difference. Ultimately, we must bring about change to overcome the social disadvantage which we now notice amongst our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander friends. Education is fundamental to that. The coalition fully supports this bill.

That is not the case.

The Mabo High Court decision, which was a momentous decision on this question, put to bed forever one of the most serious and gross offences that could ever be claimed against Aboriginal people, and that was the suggestion that they were not here in Australia before 1788—the concept of terra nullius, an unoccupied land.

         There are Aboriginal people who, despite Mabo, are the least benefited by it because they have been the most dispossessed.

Those Aboriginal people who were the most dispossessed, who were the most displaced, who have been the most disadvantaged, who have been the most alienated from their initial land are the people who can provide no such proof.

I think those changes first came about at the time of the extremely important 1967 referendum. For the first time, Aboriginal people were to be treated in the same way as other Australians in relation to the census and in relation to the capacity of national governments to legislate on their behalf. Since Federation, since the Commonwealth came into existence, most referendums have been defeated. The 1967 referendum was overwhelmingly supported.

         The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, for example, undertakes periodic examinations of the circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A committee report on access and equity, which was tabled, I think, here in the House in November last year, was designed to examine the extent to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had equitable access to Commonwealth programs and services. That access and equity strategy has been in place, as far as the government is concerned, since 1985 and it was extended to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 1989.

         Part of the executive summary in connection with that inquiry said that the strategy `had still to achieve any significant outcomes for Australia's most disadvantaged and dispossessed groups of people'. Those barriers, of course, which help to impede the removal of disadvantage include racism, language, culture, inappropriately designed and delivered services, and a lack of services in many areas.

         Fundamental to this question as well was the Elliott Johnston Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Commissioner Johnston's report made 339 recommendations, which were not simply designed to look after Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when in gaol but were to prevent their incarceration in the first place. He quite correctly, and I thought admirably, canvassed the whole area of Aboriginal rights, circumstances and conditions. And 338 of those recommendations were endorsed by Australian governments; only one out of the 339 recommendations was not. Those recommendations which specifically related to education were from 289 to 299. I make mention of the observation made by Commissioner Johnston in relation to preschool. He said:

         Let me give some background information about this situation generally. Towards the end of the 1980s, less than half of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children had any preschool experience compared with a national rate in excess of 90 per cent—an area of serious disadvantage in relation to the point I have just made about the importance of preschool access. Only about 85 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children of compulsory school age were actually in school compared with a national rate so close to 100 per cent that it does not matter. Only 10 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 15 held any post-school qualifications compared with a national rate of over 30 per cent.

         It is a national tragedy that indigenous Australians continue to be the most chronically disadvantaged group on every social indicator—health, housing, employment and education. In many respects they are more disadvantaged than many of the people of the Third World. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are Australian citizens—just as truly, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and I are. They are not to be marginalised and sidelined. The deficiencies have to be made up and compensations have to be built into the system.

         The commissioner, Elliott Johnston, made it clear that the major factor leading to the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody is their disadvantaged and unequal position in Australian society. He investigated 99 cases of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Of those 99 cases, 40 represented people who had not proceeded beyond primary school—and only two had completed secondary schooling. Since the completion of the royal commission, another 55 Aboriginal people have died in custody—the number may now exceed 55.

         There are some bright spots. Let me deal with some of them. In 1982 there were 854 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in higher education institutions; in 1992, there were 4,807. In 1989 the participation rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in the 17 to 64 year age group in tertiary education institutions was 20 in every thousand. In 1991 the rate increased to 35 in every thousand. In 1988 there were 2,565 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders enrolled in universities. In 1993, there were 5,578. That is an increase of 117 per cent. The number of all Australians participating in university education between 1988 and 1993 increased by 32 per cent, so there was a dramatically larger increase for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

         Even in 1993, ATSI students made up only one per cent of the student population when, as a proportion of the total population, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders made up about two per cent. I think that it was 1991 when the intake of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students into the universities finally reached the same level as their numbers as a proportion of the population. I say in response to the former shadow minister, who spoke in opening for the opposition, that we are making progress. That progress is being made by this government and by these ministers because of the level of the commitment which they are demonstrating.

May I ask him who he thinks is responsible for the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act which gave—at present—over a third of the Northern Territory to Aboriginal people. Was that not the Fraser government? Let us consider the Tonkin government in South Australia. Some 20 per cent of South Australia was given to the Pitjantjatjara and Maralinga people.

         Let us take that a bit further. The honourable member for Charlton was talking about the Native Title Act and how marvellous a benefit this had been to Aboriginal people. Recently I had a chance to talk with some of those Aboriginal people about that act. An Aboriginal lawman said that, originally, white men took Aboriginal land; now Aboriginal people were taking Aboriginal land from other Aboriginal people. He ended the submission that he gave to me by saying that, on the basis of this native title legislation, there will be bloodshed amongst Aboriginal people. Is that something to be proud of?

The Aboriginal lawman also said that the most disadvantaged Australians, those Aboriginal people who do not benefit from Mabo, are `the fundamental premise for the land fund'. The land fund is to cover those people who cannot make a claim. I ask the honourable member for Charlton why the land fund bill currently before this parliament does not specify that the fund is for those people who cannot make a claim under Mabo. There is no mention at all in the land fund legislation of what has been called `the fundamental premise in the legislation'. I suggest that the honourable member should read his own government's legislation before grandstanding in here on subjects that he knows absolutely nothing about.

         As both the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) have pointed out, these funds are to assist in overcoming the disadvantage that Aboriginal people suffer in education. A 1988 task force concluded that Aboriginal people were disadvantaged in educational opportunities. To the honourable member for Charlton, who has lauded the achievements of this government while at the same time referring to the incredibly appalling situation that Aboriginal people in this country live in, certainly in relation to their educational standards, I ask: why, after 11 years in government, is that the case if it is not through a failure of this government?

         Following the report of the task force, the Aboriginal education program was developed by the Commonwealth in conjunction with the states and territories. Arising out of the Aboriginal education program was the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, which funds Aboriginal education programs. It provides funds to organisations and institutions to supplement the costs of delivering educational services to Aboriginal people. The program supports preschools, primary and secondary schools, and technical and further education. The funding is provided by the Commonwealth as a supplement to the normal provisions of funds for education in the states and territories and is committed on a forward triennial basis.

         We are in the second triennium of the Aboriginal education program, which runs from 1993 to 1995. A total of $244 million was committed for the triennium, and originally $83.9 million was committed for the 18-month period from January 1995 to June 1996. This bill increases that amount by $212,000. I believe the proposed increase of $212,000 for 1995-96 and $256,000 for 1996-97 are additional amounts to cover student places at Notre Dame University in Western Australia and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in the Kimberley region.

         That said, I will now move forward from the points made by the honourable member for Braddon, who I think covered very adequately the situation regarding the education of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal children in Australia, and discuss some of the very pertinent issues that have been raised with me. I shall discuss the issues in sequence. They all concern education. The first issue arose in Queensland when I visited the Wjal Wjal Aboriginal community. The women in that community approached me with an issue they wished to take up with me. That issue was a key issue—the education of their children.

         The problem the women raised with me was that because the community was so small the children had to move to a larger centre for schooling and they had to board; but the bus that took them to school went on Tuesdays, not on Sundays. As a result, the children missed the first two days of the school week, which was hardly conducive to helping them with their school work.

         These are some of the problems that Aboriginal children face in getting an adequate education. The Aboriginal communities are isolated and often the whole infrastructure has not been put in place to allow them access to education. This is something that the states and the Commonwealth have to address as a very high priority.

         The second community was one that I met at the Central Land Council. Women from adjoining communities came to me. They wanted to talk about education for their children because they wanted their children to be able to go into Alice Springs when they grew up and compete with everybody else for jobs. Because of the way the children were being taught currently they would not be able to do this.

         I would not like to see this as a precedent for all communities but, quite interestingly, these women mentioned that the teacher in the Aboriginal community was teaching the children in their own language. The women said to me, `We don't want our children taught in our own language. They speak our language at home. They know the language. We want our children to be taught perfect English to improve their chance of getting a job when they finish school.'

         I mention that as an individual instance. In other communities where there may be two or three language groups I believe it is important to keep that language in the school because the children do not have as much access to their own language in the general community. It was an interesting variation on the trend in various communities to teach the children in their own language. The women were saying, `No, that is not what we want. What we want is for the children to learn really good English.' That is something that we have to take on, and the opposition will be doing that in our policy.

         The third matter is a much more exciting development. I had an opportunity to go to Yuendumu in the Northern Territory.

         I need not have worried. The Aboriginal people themselves have come up with a solution, and that solution is the Tanami network. The honourable member for Charlton, who seems to be interested in these matters, may not have heard of this network. The Tanami network currently links several urban and regional centres. On the link-up are Darwin, Lajamanu, Yuendumu, Willowra, Kintore and Alice Springs. The Tanami network is probably the most exciting thing that I have seen in a long time. It is an interactive television network whereby children can sit in front of a television set and be taught by a teacher who is possibly 15,000 miles away. My immediate thought was this: wouldn't David Suzuki not like the opportunity to appear before a class of Aboriginal children and teach them? With the Tanami network he could.

         The children in the class can control the camera at the other end—obviously not all of them at once.

The camera can be moved to highlight the blackboard or anything else that the teacher wishes to show the class. In his or her turn the teacher is viewing that class on a television monitor and has the opportunity to move the monitor around to see the children in the class, so that when one child raises his or her hand the teacher can see the hand and ask, `What is your question?'

         The Leader of the Opposition described himself as born of the Liberal Party. In my assessment in this policy area, it is much more likely that he has been born of paternalism. It is important to point out that paternalism in Aboriginal affairs is every bit as damaging and dangerous as bigotry, because paternalism relies on a pessimistic judgment about the nature of Aboriginal people—that they cannot be relied upon to make effective decisions about their needs and welfare or land, employment or social conditions, and that only affluent European stock can make these judgments. In many respects, this is the mission reborn into social policy. It has certainly been a feature of the way in which the Liberal Party in recent times has addressed the issue of native title. A true liberal party would regard any denial of decision making as a fundamental breach of human rights.

         The review being undertaken by the government is very important because education for Aboriginal people has immense power and opportunity to bring about social, political and economic change. The key question raised in the review is: can public education resources be applied differently to ensure that indigenous people have the opportunity to achieve equitable outcomes and satisfy a right to have education delivered in more culturally appropriate ways? Looking at the progress so far, there is an opportunity to build on the achievements of this government but to do so in a more culturally appropriate fashion, to produce the reform and improvements for Aboriginal people in education and other areas of social policy that I am sure each member of the parliament would wish.

         Since 1986, while the gaps in participation between Aboriginals and other Australians in the age group of three to five years have narrowed, they still remain significant—9.5 per cent—with a higher proportion of five-year-old Aboriginal children, 13.2 per cent, not participating in any form of education; they are mainly located in remote areas of the country. Participation rates are increasing for the compulsory years of schooling. Like other Australians, the vast majority of Aboriginal children will begin and complete primary school. However, an estimated 25 per cent of those who start secondary school education leave before the end of year 10. In 1993, one-third of Aboriginal students who began tertiary school were still attending in year 12, compared with 76 per cent of other Australians. The retention rate is less than half of the non-Aboriginal Australian population.

         University participation rates are still lower than the national average, however—although the number of Aboriginal university students more than doubled between 1988 and 1993. Education, of course, translates into labour market opportunities. Lower rates of employment and a larger proportion of Aboriginal unemployed are great problems in this field. Thirty-eight per cent of 20- to 24-year-old Aboriginals are outside the labour market. In this age group, Aboriginal incomes are about 80 per cent of those of other Australians.

         In many respects, this government can point to a record in Aboriginal education that has seen greater improvements than any other government since federation. The statistic on TAFE is outstanding. We need to do more in other areas of participation. I point out that there is a problem with indicators such as these in that they inevitably place pressure on Aboriginal people to make a cultural shift towards the mainstream values that these measures reflect. I think that is an area in which government and policy makers can learn. There have been improvements, but perhaps through more culturally appropriate forms of education and other service delivery even greater improvements can be made.

         It is dangerous to assume that Aboriginal people can selectively adopt mainstream material benefits while holding on to their own culture. I notice that there is too little mention in the literature on the review of the Aboriginal education policy of Aboriginal culture and values. Rather, the measures of success are linked more closely to Anglo-Saxon culture than to Aboriginal cultural standards. We need only to look at the history of Aboriginal housing policy in Australia to understand how decisions pushed upon Aboriginal people by federal and state bureaucrats, isolated in their centres of decision making, have had adverse effects.

         There needs to be greater suitability and understanding of the needs of Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal communities. For instance, the housing types provided for many decades do not necessarily take account of the Aboriginal extended family structure. Sometimes people point to the problem of overcrowding, but if the housing was built around the needs of Aboriginal families with an extended family structure then overcrowding would not be such a problem. Within Aboriginal families, children have a right to freedom of behaviour in the house far wider—I suppose, by our standards, it is much more lenient—than that which would apply in non-Aboriginal Australia. Also, houses are left empty in Aboriginal communities when a death is associated with them.

         For instance, the missions that were established around Australia were a great tragedy. The idea of the missionaries taking Aboriginal people away from their land and establishing them in isolated communities and some of the squats that can be seen in Central Australia and North Queensland has been a tragedy, but it was well motivated. They thought that giving people a

         and what they regarded as a proper education would lead to progress. It did not because it rode over the top of the sorts of values and culture that should be respected by non-Aboriginal Australians. Equally, the equal pay decision in Australia in the late 1960s was well intentioned and generally a good reform, but it had the unintended consequence of pastoralists no longer employing Aboriginal people on pastoral stations because they did not want to pay the equal pay.

        Real social justice demands a more sophisticated perspective of Aboriginal and mainstream societies which displays notions of inequality based solely on cultural arrogance. That would require that the majority of society more readily accepts the differences between the two societies, not solely as inequality but as aspects of very different cultures. Some of these differences are unpalatable and often politically difficult, but wallpapering over them will not make them go away. Such a model of social justice would be highly unpopular with many in both societies. The current model makes it possible at least in the short-term for the national government—

        A very interesting point is made by this former principal of a school in the Northern Territory about getting the right mix for what we would regard as achievement and the proper sensitivities to and regard for Aboriginal culture and values. It must form the basis of the next step forward in the development of social policies for Aboriginal people. This government, with its historic native title legislation, has established the basis for land rights and access to traditional land in Australia, something that is of immense importance to Aboriginal people, providing not only cultural independence but also an economic base by which security and financial prosperity can be achieved.

         Having established that foundation stone of Aboriginal policy in native title, the government can build on its achievements in areas such as Aboriginal education. It can become more aware and adaptable in administering these policies to the needs of Aboriginal culture. I am also interested in some of the models being promoted for greater local self-government within Aboriginal communities. The issue of empowerment and decision making by Aboriginal people is very important. We can have a model of native title with its cultural and economic independence benefits, with self-government in social policy; that is, taking Aboriginal people out of some of the mainstream administration that has not produced the results the parliament and the government would have hoped for, and giving Aboriginal people a better sense of their own identity and their own capacity to make decisions in their own interest.

         We have some models in Australia outside our traditional three tiers of government. For instance, Aboriginal self-government could be based at the local level on the models that have been developed on Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. They have forms of self-government which go beyond traditional local government responsibilities. If adopted with cooperation between the state and federal administrations, it could achieve greater Aboriginal input into education, health and housing policy. In Queensland we have DOGIT, deed of grant in trust. At Yarrabah near Cairns, the venue for a visit by the native title committee, of which I am a member, the committee members were exposed to some of the benefits of Aboriginal people taking greater control of responsibilities.

         They do it there at the municipal level, but surely there is the opportunity in cooperation with the states to give Aboriginal people greater power and authority in decision making in relation to housing, education and health. Many Aboriginal people have clearly stated that they want to control the matters that are important to them and to receive adequate funding to provide an improved range and quality of services. This should not be seen as a threat to other non-Aboriginal interests, least of all economic interests. Many other countries have made the practical decision that it is better for indigenous people to run their own affairs and to solve their own problems. Non-Aboriginal people and governments have not been particularly good at solving the problems that indigenous people experience, even with the most careful planning and good intentions.

It is important for the shadow minister and her Liberal and National Party colleagues to understand the model that this government is developing.

Even the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, has conceded the benefits of a national approach to native title. In 1967, 80 per cent of non-Aboriginal Western Australians—Aboriginals did not have the vote—voted to provide the national parliament with constitutional powers to make special laws for Aboriginal people. The Western Australian government's challenge in the High Court effectively seeks to overturn that mandate.

I would have thought that, as technology, transport and communication improvements provide Australia with the chance to come closer together, it is a low point in public debate and public life in this country to have a state Premier trying to drag Australians apart by playing on the parochial point of Aboriginal policy in his state.

         Firstly, I want to say a few words about land and Aboriginal people. It is important that, quite unequivocally, many of us on this side of the House accept without reservation the significance of land in Aboriginal culture and to Aboriginal people. It is also important that, quite clearly, the coalition in its totality accepted the Mabo High Court ruling. It was the particular detail of the native title legislation with which we had a problem. It is quite erroneous and divisive to the community—and it does the indigenous people of this country no good—for those opposite to try to perpetuate the myth that we do not accept those fundamental points.

         At the time of the formulation of the native title legislation, I was the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. Before the 33 principles of the government were issued in June of last year, I went to the minister, with the permission of my leader, and specifically asked whether we could deal with this on a bipartisan basis, whether we could talk privately and whether we could try to sort something out in the same way that the previous Prime Minister had done with the then leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), in terms of the reconciliation council.

The government has tried it again today. It has tried to portray the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), as having different positions from that of the Leader of the Opposition. The government has tried to give her different labels. If the shadow minister were able to speak again in this debate, I am confident that she would say that that is not the case.

If you do not do well at school then, of course, you do not complete school—which means you do not get a job and so cannot afford to get good housing. Added to that, of course, are the side issues which go with all those conditions—having too much time on your hands, getting into substance and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and overrepresentation in the legal system. We have that cycle of disadvantage. It is a cycle of disadvantage which applies to any economically deprived group anywhere in the world.

         I am concerned about retention rates in schools. We are told that the figures are improving, but in respect of many of the places that I have visited in the four years I have been in this place—as a shadow minister, as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and as a member of the House of Representatives committee—I do not believe that the statistics are accurate. Many of the schools and communities that I have been to tell me that the figures are often fudged for all sorts of reasons. They might be fudged to make the teachers look as though they are doing a better job than they are. They might be fudged because some payments of government funds are based on the number of kids that go to a particular school. So there is some percentage in artificially inflating those figures. The statistics for attendance, retention rates and achievements are often very doubtful.

One of the problems with traditional learning is that it does not necessarily do a lot of good when the students want to get a job. I am not saying we should not have traditional learning; I am saying that there is often a conflict and communities have to make a fundamental choice—do they want to get into the economy or do they want traditional learning.

         I am reminded of a school at Yirrkala, up in Gove, which has been held up for some years as a good example of Aboriginal control of a school. I remember going there with the House of Representatives Aboriginal affairs committee three or four years ago. People were saying, `Isn't this good?  Doesn't it work well? Isn't everybody in the community pleased?' A couple of years later when I was up in that neck of the woods I talked to the senior management of Nabalco, which is the major local industry and employer. I asked them why they did not have more Aboriginal people on their payroll. One of the reasons they quoted was that the children coming out of that school, those you would expect to comprise a fair proportion of those applying for jobs at Nabalco, frankly did not have what we in our terms would regard as a basic education. They had an education and had gone quite a long way through the school system—year 9, year 10, year 11 or whatever—but they really did not have the command of English, the literacy skill, that was needed for a worthwhile job within Nabalco.

And we wonder why, after six months of living in a house like that, in a hot climate, with that number of people, things start to break down!

         —I started young. Some schools overcome it by having homework sessions in the school classroom after the normal school day. But when the children go home, if they are not getting the right nourishment or if the environment is not right—in terms of domestic violence or stoushes—those sorts of things have to be fixed as well. I am not condemning the indigenous people in that sense; I am saying that the associated problems have to be fixed as well as the purely educational problems.

         I think it is also important to remember that many of our Aboriginal people live in urban environments. When people move into the cities, we tend to take the view that their aspirations and requirements are the same as those of other people living in urban areas. That is not necessarily the case, in my experience. We have to recognise that quite often the traditional culture and values are just as important to urban dwelling Aboriginal people as they are to those in the more remote communities.

         Many of the young non-Aboriginal constituents in my electorate, in outer-eastern Melbourne, a lot of whom are unemployed, say to me, `You tell us to go on with our education, or do some TAFE training, or go to university, or whatever. What for? Unemployment is so bad that we're not gonna get a damn job anyway.' With the unemployment levels of Aboriginal people, that response and that attitude are even more emphatic.

         We have to do things about the employment situation for indigenous people concurrently with classroom education. Otherwise they will say, `What on earth is it for', and we will get a very highly educated but very dissatisfied group in our community. Then in Australia we will start to see some of the civil unrest that we have seen with some of the coloured population in America—from which, mercifully, we have been spared. I think it is something we need to be conscious of and to treat with a great degree of sensitivity.

         I also want to briefly refer to the tertiary sector. It seems to me that more Aboriginal people are going to university. But I really wonder how effective some of that education is and whether the courses are appropriate. I also sometimes wonder whether we are able to harness the people who have been through university to go back to communities and help their own people. Quite often, when they do go back to their own communities there is a gulf and they seem to have lost a lot of that contact.

         Many tertiary qualified indigenous people join the Public Service. There are probably more tertiary qualified Aboriginal people in Canberra than in the rest of the nation. Why should they not join the Public Service? They are individuals, they are Australians, and they are entitled to apply for a job wherever they want.

         I would personally like to see us do what has been done in other countries and walks of life. Some scholarships could be tied whereby those who achieve an education return to their community and provide a few years service there. I do not see that as being racially discriminatory. It could apply to doctors, teachers or any other profession in many ways regardless of race. If people are going to be given free education, why can they not be expected to give something back to the community in return?

         We then turn to the very vexed subject of whether we should have separate schools for indigenous people. Why not? We have separate schools for religious groups, such as Catholics. There really should be no discrimination in that sense. But there is often a problem with regard to the economic viability of separate schools where there are not large numbers of indigenous people in a particular area. It certainly seems to me that, in many cases, it is an appropriate way to go. I have noticed that quite often where there are essentially Aboriginal schools they very seldom have any objection to taking on the odd non-Aboriginal person who happens to live in the area. But that does not always seem to occur in reverse.

         A fundamental point in terms of education, as in so many other areas of indigenous endeavour, is that there has to be much more local and indigenous control over decision making. It seems to me that only with drive and initiative coming out of communities will there start to be some ownership of the problems, issues and solutions. The communities will then start to become much more effective. All too often, the present approach is from the top down rather than from the bottom up, and that is not the best approach that we can take in education, health and so many other areas.

         Before I run out of time, I want to make one other comment. It is perhaps instructive to look at our situation in indigenous affairs with what goes on overseas. In the last few weeks, I have had the benefit of making some overseas visits. In particular, I went to both California and Washington in the United States and to British Columbia and Ottawa in Canada to talk to indigenous people there. I also spoke to both the state governments and, in the Canadian situation, the provincial governments and the national governments in those two countries about a range of indigenous matters, not exclusively the education issue.

         I read with interest a couple of days ago an article in a newspaper by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) about the Navaho Indians. I will address that article on a separate occasion, because I do not quite agree with many of the conclusions that he has drawn. But it seems to me that, although the approaches to indigenous affairs in America and Canada are slightly different from ours, there is nevertheless a great degree of commonality of approach in the sorts of ideas that we advocate. One can argue whether they are doing better than us. But I have to say that the outcomes in terms of actual statistics are not much different and that they are as dissatisfied as us.

         Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander unemployment rates at the time of the 1991 census were 2.6 times higher than for other Australians. However, this had improved from 1986 when their unemployment rates were 3.8 times higher. Although they are painfully slow, improvements are being made. Income for indigenous Australians is still about two-thirds of the national average and the unmet demands for housing infrastructure in this country have been estimated to be presently $1.7 billion.

In higher education, indigenous students made up just over one per cent of the total enrolments in 1993, but made up 1.5 per cent of new enrolments. That is very promising when we note that indigenous Australians make up 1.6 per cent of the overall population. However, it should be noted that the birth rate of Aboriginal people is higher than the birth rate of non-Aboriginal people. We need to respond to an increasing educational demand for this particularly disadvantaged group.

         I was pleased to have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), visit my electorate on 28 July. I took him to Lakes Creek Primary School where he met a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and resource teacher, Maryanne Sullivan. Her position is funded under the national Aboriginal education policy, regrettably only for five hours per week. She is currently finishing her teaching degree at Central Queensland University. The school also receives $100 per year per child from the ASSPA funding to provide resources and to assist Aboriginal students. This is a very small amount of money and really highlights the myths about the buckets of money which go to Aboriginal students and the apparently unequal access of Aboriginal students to the educational system. It is vitally important that we educate the wider community to understand that the sort of assistance we are giving to Aboriginal students, being meagre at best, is vitally important to address their educational disadvantage. I would call on the government to provide more funding to provide educational opportunities.

         The principal at the Lakes Creek school, Yvette Dawson, is encouraging the involvement of Aboriginal parents. She pointed out that that is not an easy thing to achieve. Many of the parents have had very negative educational experiences or very limited educational opportunities and need to be encouraged. This school is participating in providing educational options for mainstream students, non-indigenous students, to have a more effective understanding of Aboriginal culture. We obviously have to do much more of this.

         There is no doubt that we have a problem in this area. Teaching graduates are picked up in the wider system of employment opportunities. This often means that trained teachers are lost to the education system. It is vital that we have Aboriginal teachers in positions of responsibility teaching both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in our schools so that both Aboriginal students and their non-Aboriginal counterparts learn to respect each other's culture. We have to increase the base from which we are achieving our graduates. We have to make sure that all teaching graduates are encouraged into the teaching system, particularly in remote locations.

         On two occasions during the break I was delighted to attend the Dreamtime Cultural Centre in Rockhampton. One was when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited Capricornia on 19 July and the other was the official opening of the theatre complex by Lois O'Donoghue, the chairperson of ATSIC.

While we were there, we met some young Aboriginal students from Woorabinda who were visiting with their school.

During that school assembly, a very small Aboriginal group of students presented a mural to the rest of the school. They had painted that mural as part of an after homework program initiative, another funding initiative of this government. It was great to see how proud they were to be presenting to a mining town which is fairly well monocultural examples of their cultural heritage. These sorts of initiatives which this government has been funding and dealing with, which are once again part of the bill before us today, will make a difference.

While we continue to think that the way to solve injustice and inequality for Aboriginal people is to fix up the problems according to our view of the world—that is, a white Anglo-Celtic view—we will continue to fail. Until we are prepared to acknowledge the importance of Aboriginal people, that real empowerment will come only from real reconciliation based on the reality of the invasion, the dispossession and the subsequent genocide and the need to right those wrongs and the need for a truly bipartisan approach, we will continue to make the sorts of mistakes that have ended up in the sorts of concerns expressed from both sides of the House.

It is still pandering to vested interest groups, such as Mr Court in Western Australia. Until the true liberals have the numbers to deal with this issue, I am afraid that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) will continue to plummet in the opinion polls and `Winnie the Pooh' will be the mantle that he will achieve.

         I come before this House to speak on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill with the proposition that the education provided by all state and territory governments of whatever political persuasion has totally failed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people because, if we look at the degree of literacy and numeracy problems, we see that they are totally widespread. The honourable member for Charlton pointed out that Charlie Perkins was the first university graduate, and another speaker has said that we now have thousands—I think that was the figure—of Aboriginal people involved in universities. That is great, but it is not enough. I make it plain that education in Australia has failed the Aboriginal people. We can point to the little success stories here and there, but the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as it went around Australia for many weeks since this parliament started, did not hear many.

         In Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Queensland—you name it—everywhere we go, we say, `How many Aboriginal kids in year 12?' We ask that question almost religiously. Everywhere we go we are told, `None', or `One', or `Two'. That is not satisfactory. It is good that retention rates are improving, but the overall situation regarding education is not satisfactory. I suppose I can be accused of being dramatic when I say that all our education systems have failed Aboriginal people. I accept the accusation. We need to dramatise the problem that Aboriginal literacy and numeracy skills are very low.

         We all know about the numbers of Aboriginal people in gaol and how they are far out of proportion to the numbers of Aboriginals in the general community. In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal people make up 26 or 27 per cent of the total population but they make up 85 per cent of the gaol population. While I do not know the accurate answer, I am willing to bet right now that at least 95 per cent of those 85 per cent of the gaol population are illiterate. Somebody also speaking in this debate, I think on my side of the House, referred to the cycle of Aboriginal society. You have poor housing, and therefore you have poor health, and therefore you have poor education, and therefore you do not get a job and, because you do not get a job, you cannot afford decent housing. That is a pretty good description.

         I am convinced that the four things that are of outstanding importance for the development of Aboriginal people are: health, education, housing and employment—not necessarily in that order. As my colleagues on the committee know, as far as I am concerned education is the key. I am not talking purely about the education of children. We have children from several schools in the galleries today. All three of the galleries at the top of the chamber and some of the public galleries have children in them. I am not talking about maths and science alone but about total education to equip people to be effective in society. That cycle we have described is in full acceleration. Unless we do something to put a spike in the wheels, to stop it turning, it will continue.

         So far, in spite of the success stories we can point to—and there are some—that acceleration is continuing. The honourable member for Capricornia very rightly said that we need to dispel the myths associated with Aboriginal education. Those myths are there. The difficulty is how you separate the fact from the myth. There is a need for that education to extend beyond the Aboriginal community. Even today, prior to speaking in this debate, I talked to high school teachers and heard that in many of our high schools there is animosity from the European kids, the white kids, regarding the amount of money that Aboriginal kids have to spend in the tuckshop. They have more than the white kids. True or false? I do not know. It is not for me to make a definitive statement, but it is a question that should be asked. Aboriginal kids do appear, according to the myths, to be getting special treatment over and above the other kids in the schools.

Surely to heaven we have to walk right away from this. Whether it is myth or fact, we have to get away from the situation where there can be divisiveness on the basis of race.

         Reference has been made to another one of my hobbyhorses—otitis media, otherwise known as glue ear. This is something that I talk about all the time. I think the member for Capricornia said that the cause of it is not known. This may be true, but the information I have is that two major contributing factors of otitis media in young children are nutrition and hygiene and the incidence of smoking and alcohol in their mothers. We have to look at these factors when considering my definition of education, which goes beyond maths, science, English and so on.

         In Australia there is a high incidence of otitis media. A classic example is in my own electorate in the Macleay Valley where something like 94 per cent of the kids between the ages of three and six suffer from this disease. This is absolutely appalling. However, the good thing is that the Durri Aboriginal Medical Service has an audiometrist and a specialised hearing facility that can test and find out whether the children are deaf. Until we find out whether the kids are deaf or not, there is not much we can do about it. This is a significant indicator.

         Due to their hearing impairment, the language development and socialisation of these kids is about three years behind other kids who do not suffer from the disease. They start school and are three years behind in language development. We have to take into account—not necessarily in Macleay but other parts of Australia—that English is the second language for Aboriginal children. Assuming that English is their first language and they start school, if they have not developed to the same stage as other kids and they cannot hear, they are not going to be able to learn.

         —I want to join this debate on Aboriginal education by first of all dealing with the point on which my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) finished—that the money does not get through. It is inevitable when we are dealing with Aboriginal issues that the criticism immediately flows from the opposition that we have been here for 11 years, have spent all this money and have got nowhere.

         Let me say this to the honourable gentleman: one of the problems we have is that the gentlemen opposite are firm believers on every occasion of the concept of states rights. The Commonwealth provides the funding, but the administration of the program is left to the states. If you want to know why there is a disparity within states and between states in the quality of education and housing—in some areas of Australia the quality of housing is good and in other areas it is totally inadequate for Aboriginal people—it is because the administration of those programs on the ground is left to the states.

         Are we really advancing Aboriginal housing? If we give funds to the states, they send in a building contractor to build one or two houses which for the most part are plonked into the community without any input from or discussion with that community. In many cases this housing is totally inadequate or totally inappropriate for that community. When the contractor goes away there are no skills left in that community to repair electrical faults or other faults that may arise. So, if we are going to share blame, it should be shared equally.

         One of the great tragedies facing Australian people when we talk about reconciliation is that unfortunately Her Majesty's opposition has yet to get its exercise, its principles and its policies clear. The greatest disadvantage that Aboriginal people face on the issue of reconciliation is the total confusion and abnegation of political and social responsibility from members of the opposition. They cannot have it both ways. I can only wish the shadow minister well.

         If there are these problems that bedevil education it is because basically in many states of Australia the view is that, if only Aboriginal people would be like us and accept our values and our concepts, there would be no problem. You cannot separate educational policies from the philosophy, the tradition and the culture of a people that has been subject to a holocaust for over 200 years.

I remind the Treasurer that before the last federal budget the Governor of the Reserve Bank and many other economic commentators urged the government to accelerate the reduction of the budget deficit. Since the government did not take that advice, does the Treasurer now acknowledge that the cost of the government's irresponsible budget is now being paid for by small businesses and home borrowers in the form of higher interest rates?

         The fact is that monetary policy has a role to play in keeping inflation down, along with fiscal policy. We have a fiscal policy which involves a reduction in the budget deficit of a considerable order over the next few years. It is a deficit reduction program which stands up pretty well compared with those of other countries which have announced deficit reduction targets—none of them having a target of less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We expect to be below that point and, therefore, to have a thoroughly credible fiscal policy and one which is appropriate to our economic circumstances.

         That said, it is also important that monetary policy is not kept in some frozen state. In the course of an economic cycle, one does not want to have more interest rate increases than are required but that does not mean that we therefore try to keep them in some frozen state for as long as possible. Pursuing that course would most likely mean that at some stage or other we would be forced into quite substantial increases and most likely have larger increases in official interest rates than would be the case if moving in an appropriate way.

         Clearly, in terms of the market response, there being an increase in official rates at this time, in order to ensure that we do not have an outbreak of inflation and we keep our inflation in that range of two to three per cent, which the Reserve Bank has said is appropriate and with which we agree, we have seen that the official rate increase of 0.75 per cent has not led to an increase in long-term rates. Indeed, long-term rates have fallen. The 10-year bond rate today is about 20 points less than it was at the time—

         —It is 20 basis points less than it was on the day before we increased official interest rates. So we see that bond rates have come down. The same is true for shorter bonds. That is quite important for investment. Investment costs will be largely determined by bond rates, not by bank lending rates—although obviously they are not irrelevant; they are important for businesses with overdrafts. To that extent, as business overdraft rates go up, they would be affected. In terms of raising funds for investment through long-term loans, the bond rates obviously are very important. Those bond rates have come down. So there can be no assumption that there is some sort of adverse effect on business investment overall as a result of this action.

         It is just simply untrue to argue, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that if we had a lower budget deficit at this time we would have been able to avoid some increase in interest rates. New Zealand perhaps bears up the point. In New Zealand, there has been a move to a budget surplus with considerably higher taxes as a percentage of GDP than we have. That has given it a budget surplus at this stage. With that budget surplus, however, its official interest rates have gone up, not 0.75 per cent but 2.75 per cent. It is simply a non sequitur to argue that if we had a tighter budget deficit there would therefore be no need to adjust interest rates. In New Zealand, with a budget surplus, there has been a much sharper movement in interest rates than here.

         Clearly, monetary policy has to be utilised. The opposition wants to argue that we should never use monetary policy. It would indeed make for a unique position on the part of a potential government in this country for it to say, `If we get into government, we will never increase interest rates and monetary policy would never be used.' It would be simply laughed out of court by the markets and anyone who knows anything about economics as a totally unreal position.

This meeting was a follow-on to the meeting in February in Hobart, where the states and the federal government looked at the desirability of implementing the Hilmer report. It very much affects the states in terms of the need to open up their government enterprises to competition, to allow federal law to apply in respect of unincorporated enterprises which are not covered by the Trade Practices Act and to allow the Trade Practices Act to apply to state trading enterprises. The states are very much involved in this. What we were doing in Darwin was taking it to the next step.

         Before we could get on to that agenda in Darwin, we were hit with a demand by the Liberal premiers, who sought to use this occasion to put maximum leverage on the Commonwealth to extract some new funding arrangement. It was led by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett. It was put that all future revenue growth for the Commonwealth should be split fifty-fifty with the states. If that were to happen, they would be prepared to go on and discuss the benefits of implementing the Hilmer report and perhaps be involved in it.

At the present time, financial assistance grants to the states cover 15 per cent of our tax revenue. Yet they wanted a 50 per cent share of all future growth in our revenues. They have amazing cheek.

         In any case, the issue of a fixed formula has many problems. Any fixed revenue sharing formula would probably only apply, as far as the states are concerned, to the good times. What they see, looking out in the years ahead—these figures are contained in the national fiscal outlook—is a very strong projection of government revenues feeding off continued high economic growth. They think, `Fair enough. We would like a big share of that.'

         But they ignore that in the recent past we had a period, with the recession and low growth, where Commonwealth revenues actually fell. Would they want a share of that? Did they ask for a share of our reduced revenues? Of course not. Would they in the future if such an occasion arose again? Of course not. They would want to maintain their real payments, which was what they were given in the last recession and its aftermath. They were protected through that period. They did not have to share in the fall of the Commonwealth revenues, so they were thoroughly protected.

         If they had had a fixed share through that period they would have received $2.3 billion less than they in fact received, because they were protected by this same real level of financial assistance grant arrangement. We did that even though the states had a faster growth of revenue through that recession period than we did. The states' revenues were not affected in the way ours were. The states in fact had real growth through 1989-90 to 1993-94 in their tax revenue of 17.5 per cent, and the federal tax revenue fell in real terms by 3.7 per cent. So there was a total disjunction between what happened to the states in the recession and what happened to us but, despite the fact our revenue fell in real terms, we maintained the real value of their grants even though their revenue continued to grow quite rapidly.

         Current arrangements are clearly quite reasonable; they protect the states in the bad times. With the change that we made at the last Premiers Conference, which was to give them not just the same real but the same real per capita, we gave them a 1 1/4 per cent real growth factor built in. We did that partly on the expectation that they would be cooperative in relation to the Hilmer reforms. They have now a guaranteed share of growth in the future as well as protection in the bad times, and the current arrangements are therefore highly appropriate.

         Nevertheless, the government did offer instead to enhance current arrangements by sharing revenues from the Hilmer reforms to which the states have contributed. This means that if the federal government gets additional growth over what it otherwise would have had as a result of the Hilmer reforms being implemented, and one would expect that to be the case, it is prepared to look at sharing any disproportionate revenue growth it gets because the states will get some improvement in their revenue from higher growth anyway. Of course, we have to get around to implementing the reforms first.

         It is important to understand that the states have to come on board before there can be any additional revenue to share. It is a matter of the states trying to put the cart before the horse—particularly the Liberal states, which ganged up on a federal government on a political basis on this occasion to do that. The Leader of the Opposition undoubtedly supported their doing that. He says that he supports giving them a fixed share. For all the reasons that I have given, that would be an absurd thing to do but if he wants to pursue absurd policies I guess that would not be unusual because he has a lot of other absurd policies as well.

         I assume that that is what Senator Evans was getting at and I thoroughly support it. There are various pressures on the banks. The area of housing loans has been highly competitive and we would expect that in those circumstances the banks would be rather cautious about moving quickly to pass on the full amount of the increase. Various factors will be operating on banks and making them decide what to do about that, including what happens to their deposit rates. Banks have to make their own decisions about increases in their deposit rates. Of course, some of the funding costs that they incur are set in the marketplace anyway, and some of those costs have increased. The degree to which they have increased will vary from bank to bank. There is no clarity about the cost pressures that each bank will have to wear in terms of passing on those additional costs to bank mortgage rates.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The likely outcome is that banks will not pass on the full amount. Of course, in so far as they seek to pass on any percentage increase, it is then not at all clear what that will actually mean for mortgage holders because, as interest rates have come down, many people with mortgages have chosen to maintain their payments at the rate that they were before, so they are paying well in excess of the minimum rate required by their bank. Even with an increase in interest rates, it is quite possible that they will continue to be able to pay the same amount and still be paying well above the minimum rate that they would be required to pay by the bank on the particular loan. That very important factor is operating.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is also the capacity for banks to extend loans rather than to increase the payments, so there are all sorts of possible outcomes. The most likely outcome is that less than the full three-quarters of one per cent will be passed on. It is even more difficult to ascertain the actual impact on the monthly repayments by mortgage holders, but it will not mean any increase at all for many of them.

Despite the good news that came through in the last fortnight on employment growth, the fact still is that unemployment remains unacceptably high and, accordingly, the most important social and economic issue still confronting this government is getting it down. However, the recent figures confirm that we are making substantial inroads into this task. The 90,000 growth in employment in the last month has seen the total number of jobs created since this government was re-elected to office 15 months ago grow by 376,000. When we went to the election we said that we would create 500,000 jobs, so we are 75 per cent on the way to the target in 40 per cent of the time.

         The recent job growth has brought the unemployment rate down to 9 1/2 per cent, despite the fact that the participation rate went up. The unemployment rate is down from the peak of 11.2 per cent. The employment growth itself has been broad based. All states are experiencing it; it is applying more to full-time jobs than it is to part-time jobs; and males and females are equal beneficiaries of the growth.

That was that, with this economic recovery that we were going to preside over, we were not going to let the long-term unemployed be left behind. As a stark reminder, the House should be aware that from 1983 to 1989 when this government presided over that economic recovery, having been left in the mess by those that sit on the opposition benches, we created 1.6 million jobs, but only 109,000 of them went to the long-term unemployed.

That is a 14,000 drop over the previous month and takes the figure to a total drop of 76,000 in the 15 months since we were re-elected. Compare those figures with the figures for the period 1983-89 when only 109,000 long-term unemployed were picked up. Of the 376,000 jobs created in the past 15 months, 76,000 have gone to the long-term unemployed.

         This government has learnt the lesson of the 1980s: job growth alone will not solve the problem for the long-term unemployed. There need to be targeted measures to address their particular needs. The white paper builds on the initiatives that were introduced by my predecessor in targeting jobstart subsidies to the long-term unemployed. That is the reason why we are getting the drop this time, whereas we could not effect it so significantly in the period 1983-89. In addition to those targeted measures that have been built upon in the white paper, we are not only increasing the subsidies but also developing a job compact that guarantees a job to all those who have been unemployed for 18 months or longer, as well as case management to ensure that we can deal with their specific problems. We have also recognised that the thrust of the white paper has to be about ensuring that we secure sustainable economic growth in a low inflation environment. That is why the initiatives that go to skill formation and encouragement in the area of training will help the economic agenda.

         —Housing has hardly ever been as affordable as it is at present. The Commonwealth Bank index of housing affordability was at record levels at the beginning of this year. It has moved down just slightly since then, and an increase in interest rates will obviously change that a little further, but it will still be very high by historical standards. So let us start off from the point that we have very affordable housing at present. That is a function of various factors, including rising real household disposable incomes; low interest rates; and housing prices, which have been contained in recent times.

         The decision by the Reserve Bank to change the risk weighting for housing where there was a high loan to valuation ratio of over 80 per cent was taken because of the concern the bank had that there were very high rates of housing lending, increasing by over 20 per cent per annum over the last couple of years. There seemed to be a substantial number of loans being given at the very high end of those ratios, around the 90 to 95 per cent mark. Obviously, that is at the more risky end of business. The higher the loan as a proportion of the valuation of the home, the more chance there is that the person will find it difficult to service that loan with variations in their income or variations in interest rates. In those circumstances, it was thought appropriate by the Reserve Bank to change the prudential requirements.

         At present the prudential requirements give very substantial concessions to housing. Instead of having to have $1 of capital behind $1 of loan in terms of the capital adequacy ratio—which is currently eight per cent minimum—when calculating that eight per cent minimum capital adequacy ratio, they are able to discount housing loans by 50 per cent. That is a very concessional approach. The bank believes that, in the circumstances where there is this recourse to risky lending, it is appropriate to change the risk weighting ratios at that level. This is not unknown for other countries. Various European countries have done this, including Germany.

It is not likely to have any marked impact on housing lending overall because a relatively small proportion of loans are in that over-80 per cent mark. At present the capital adequacy ratio of the banks is around 12 per cent, whereas the minimum requirement is eight, so they have a lot of latitude. If they wish, they can make loans at that higher level over 80 per cent. There is no prohibition on their continuing to make loans at higher loan to valuation ratios than 80 per cent. However, if they do that, in terms of calculating their capital adequacy ratio for the purposes of meeting the eight per cent minimum, there will be no 50 per cent discount on such loans from 5 September.

         Given that the capital adequacy ratio is now 12 per cent as against the requirement of eight per cent, there is a lot of fat to be used up. It is up to the banks to decide whether they want to proceed with loans of that sort or not. Their response to it is that `we will have to wait and see'. Its effect is obviously going to be quite minimal on the overall growth of housing, which has been growing very, very strongly indeed.

         Until recently we have had a growth in the number of new housing units financed per month of around 50,000, whereas the peak in the 1980s was around 35,000. So we have had a very strong growth of housing. We expect still to have a strong growth in housing, but it will taper down from this exceptionally high level reached in recent times. That will not cause devastation to the housing market or to the ambitions of potential home buyers. It simply will mean that there will be some slight reduction in housing effort as a result of both the prudential change and the increase in interest rates. But we are still looking at very high levels of housing activity.

Let me confirm that in 1992 Potter Warburg and Price Waterhouse indicated a very wide range of values for the company of between $127.4 million negative through to $170.9 million positive. That was the span of values that that report indicated might be placed on ANL.

         I also report to the House that, in the due diligence study I released yesterday, the range of values given by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers is between $74.8 million negative and $117.8 million negative. Let me, in the interests of accuracy, state that those figures, from the two independent valuations that are available, do not in any way prove the assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition in the second part of his question that there has been a deterioration of $290 million in the value of ANL over the last two years.

         Whilst the future prospects for coking coal are quite slack, there is an opportunity for further sales in markets such as China. Of course, the opposite is the case for steaming coal. Japanese utilities expect to double the demand for steaming coal towards the end of this decade. That will provide an excellent opportunity for the Australian coal industry to take a large share of that market. We will need to maintain our competitiveness and our international reputation as a reliable supplier of coal for thermal power generation.

         I hope that I was able to give some important messages to the Japanese utilities. At the moment, there is a surplus of coal in world markets. That will not last long, particularly as growth in the Asian region takes off. At the moment, not only in Australia but in other parts of the coalmining supply industry, such as South Africa, Canada and the United States, there is a lack of investment in coal infrastructure.

It is my strong belief that this industry has the potential to double in the next 10 years. It is already Australia's largest export industry, at $7 1/2 billion, and I think the industry has the potential to double. But it will mean that Australia has to maintain its international competitiveness.

Unless we—that is, government, the Australian coal unions and the Australian coal suppliers—work as a united industry, I do not think this industry will reach its full potential. I am very confident that the report into the Australian coal industry to be brought down in October or early November by Rae Taylor will give us an extremely good outlook for the industry and that it will point the way forward. I am hoping that particular report will be a circuit breaker. I hope it will break down the attitude of us and them, which I think still exists in that industry.

         I might say, in explaining the situation of ANL, that when we found it in the situation that it was in when we came to office, which was a situation of bankruptcy, we put a capital injection into it. The board then went through the process of substantially restructuring the company. In the process of that restructuring, it went down from about 33 ships, most of which were unsuitable for its trade, to about 14 or a dozen. It also acquired additional ships which it hoped—and it was receiving private advice as well as just simply operating off its own bat—would return it to a regular stream of profitability.

         Almost immediately after that it was hit by the recession and the optimistic projections of the board were, of course, not realised. In addition very substantial changes took place in most of the areas in which its trading activities were conducted and substantial competitors emerged. All the best projections of the board came, in effect, to naught. We sought to find out exactly what the position was before we went through any process of privatisation associated with it. We went through a sensible process of due diligence. It provided us with accurate information and we acted upon it.

I can assure the House that the Federal government remains committed to the introduction of a national competition policy on 1 July 1995—in fact, the COAG communique from Darwin reaffirms that date—because we are not prepared to deprive Australians of the enormous benefits that competition will bring in terms of lower prices and sustainable jobs. Any attempts to delay the introduction of the national competition policy or to water down the main recommendations can only be at the expense of ordinary Australians and can only serve vested interests.

         The detail of the policy will be settled in February of next year, but prior to that date—in fact in a few weeks time—I will be releasing for public comment draft legislation and intergovernmental agreements. The draft legislation will deal with extending the Trade Practices Act across all areas of the economy, mainly to do with state government businesses and the professions. The intergovernmental agreements will deal with areas where the Trade Practices Act does not reach, such as access and pricing regimes. The states remain committed to the general principles of Hilmer and we are determined to address their concerns over the next six months.

         that the Commonwealth has derailed the process by continuing to give nothing to the states while they have given up everything. All I can say is that that is absolute rubbish. I notice at the bottom of the article that Mr Sturgess, the author of the article, is described as an adviser to state governments. If that is the sort of advice he is giving to state governments, I hope he has nothing to do with the Hilmer report. Let me give a few examples where he is wrong.

         Firstly, the Commonwealth government untied $700 million in road funds as the states asked. In return, the states promised to pass legislation to establish a national regime for regulating and registering road transport. That was three years ago; it still has not happened. We also agreed to take over the interstate rail freight system, which was costing the states around $350 million a year. Not only did we relieve them of that debt but we have also put around $1 billion into the system and are currently spending around $1 million a day on roads. In addition, as the Treasurer has indicated, we agreed with the states and gave them certainty in their financial planning by maintaining financial assistance grants at their same real per capita level until 1996-97.

         In addition to that we have given the states more than a billion dollars to establish the Australian National Training Authority—a whole new area of funding and one which will skill up Australians. That is not a bad record arising out of the COAG process. So we have given significant concessions to the states over the past six months in addition to all of those proposed to Hilmer. In fact, we have gone a fair way to addressing the states' concerns arising out of the Hilmer report. That has been recognised by the officials of the states, who understand the benefits that will flow not only to their states but to Australia once the Hilmer reforms are implemented.

         —The NRMA share float is quite a unique occasion. It involves the demutualisation of an organisation with 1.8 million members and the distribution to them of shares or cash in a manner determined by the board of NRMA to be commensurate with each member's interest in the organisation. It means that all members will be offered a free allocation of about $500 worth of shares, another $500 if they also hold an NRMA insurance policy, and an extra amount if they are long-term members.

         This is a very important development in the economy. The demutualisation of such a large organisation means a major change in share ownership. An issue that arose in those circumstances was the tax treatment which would apply to the issue of the shares or cash, if the members preferred to have cash. The issue that needed to be decided was the way in which capital gains tax would apply to the allocation of shares and cash.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The circumstance that existed was that under current tax law the tax office was likely to set the capital gains tax cost base, from which any accruals in value would occur as the taxable element, at zero or at $36, which was the joining fee for members of the NRMA. Therefore, a very large proportion of the allocation to members would have been subject to capital gains tax—not at the point of receipt of the shares but when the shares were sold or the cash was received.

         The government decided that this was something that should be encouraged, that the process of demutualisation is a good thing. It applies not only in cases like the NRMA's; it will also be important in other areas, such as various insurance companies. We wanted to establish something which would be an encouragement to demutualisation. We certainly did not want the tax system providing a barrier to the demutualisation, which may well have been the case had there been no attempt by the government to change what would otherwise have been the application of the tax law.

         Therefore, the government, in discussions with the NRMA, decided on an appropriate arrangement, which involved the cost base for the shares being set by reference to the net tangible assets of the NRMA group. The same cost base, for capital gains tax purposes, will be applied to those members who choose to take cash instead of the shares. The net tangible assets cost base will not be calculated until the date of demutualisation, which is in a couple of months. But the NRMA has estimated that it will represent a tax free transfer of capital to members of about $1.5 billion.

         Consistent with the tax treatment provided to previous demutualisation proposals, all franking account balances as at the date of the NRMA's demutualisation would have been cancelled. The NRMA had various franking credits through various dividends from investments. They were not utilisable as a mutual body because it did not pay dividends. But, once it became a company with dividend payments, it wished to use the franking credits to pay franked dividends.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We believed that, consistent with a previous policy for demutualisation proposals, which did not go ahead, there should be a cancelling of those credits. But, given the NRMA's expressed strong desire to retain sufficient franking credits so that it would have a capacity to pay some franked dividends, we provided it with the scope to do that in a way which is revenue neutral to the Commonwealth. That involves an amount of franking credits which the NRMA wishes to retain. It has been left to it to determine the amount.

         But the capital gains tax cost base of the net tangible assets will be reduced by $1.50 for every $1 of franking account balances retained. According to the Taxation Office, that will give us, as best as can be assessed, a revenue neutral outcome, in terms of the original proposition—the capital gains tax base net—being tangible assets and there being a complete cancellation of franking credits.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe that the arrived-at determination which allows this capacity for franking credits to be utilised in a revenue neutral way does give the NRMA a very good basis upon which to go ahead with the demutualisation. It is a major step forward for the Australian economy. It means not only that a lot of people in New South Wales will become shareholders—I hope that those who get the shares will in large part retain them and not just cash them in; we certainly expect to see a substantial boost to share ownership in New South Wales as a result of this development—but also that it has set a precedent for future demutualisations in other areas, which we will also do our best to encourage in a similar way.

         It has introduced modern letter sorting technology. In 1992-93 alone it raised labour productivity by five per cent. In the three months to June this year, Australia Post was delivering 94 per cent of letters on time or early, and that is a great achievement by any measure.

         When Australia Post announced that it was freezing the cost of a standard letter at 45c for a total period of five years, which provides benefits to all users of the postal service, what response did we get from the shadow minister for communications and the arts? Silence. Even though he hands out press releases like confetti, he had nothing to say about the fact that Australia Post has been able to keep down its price for a standard letter.

          Since the opposition always seems to look to the mother country for guidance, it is interesting to compare this performance with what is happening in Britain. The conservative government in that country is looking at options that will break up British Post and privatise the royal mail, yet it is at this very time that British Post is looking for some guidance and advice from Australia Post on how it has been able to get management and staff to work together to implement these reforms and to improve the performance of an organisation without the massive industrial turmoil that members on the other side are trying to engender.

In that respect, given that the Main Committee—the second chamber—is in use for only a period of the parliamentary sitting time, and given that it has a configuration as a chamber, it was considered that it would be a perfect opportunity to use as a resource. As a result, permission has been given to the Parliamentary Education Office to use it for that purpose. It will not, of course, be used at a time which would inconvenience its main purpose. The President and I will ensure that all members and senators are advised accordingly that that is the purpose to which it is being put.

         —There is one thing that we are reminded of by yesterday's statement by the Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). We are reminded of the old saying—we on this side of the House know it only too well—that you cannot trust Labor with other people's money. If there were ever a need to remind the people of Australia of that, there is a need to do so now. If people ever doubt the veracity of that old saying, they should not only look at what the Minister for Transport announced yesterday, they should also remind themselves of the failing of Labor in government right around Australia over the last few years—failures such as the State Bank of South Australia, WA Inc., the State Bank of Victoria, to name just a few major economic disasters that Labor in government has sat in charge of over the last few years.

         In this building at 4.30 p.m. yesterday afternoon the Minister for Transport announced yet another one of those disasters, another one of Labor's economic black holes through which it has poured a great deal of taxpayers' money and through which it is going to have to pour a great deal more taxpayers' money in order to correct the problem—if indeed the problem can be corrected. I heard the minister during question time today doubt the credibility of the claim as to the extent of the loss that has been incurred by taxpayers as a result of the failings of this government's management of ANL over the last few years.

         The minister knows only too well, if we compare the two valuations of ANL—Potter Warburg's valuation was around $200 million, and yesterday's valuation by Salomon Bros and Price Waterhouse was minus $117 million dollars—we can quickly see that the Australian taxpayers have borne a very serious loss. The reason for that is that ANL today carries a debt of $180 million. It has been carrying operating losses each and every year, averaging around $30 million over the last two years. That is a very severe loss—one which should cause this government a great deal of pain, just as other Labor governments around Australia have been caused a great deal of pain by being confronted with major government business enterprise disasters.

         It is interesting to ask the question: who is to blame for this problem?

I will tell honourable members the reason why he is not in the business of placing blame. If he pointed the finger of blame at somebody, it would end up being pointed here—at the Minister for Transport and at the government of Australia.

         Honourable members might ask themselves why Neville Wran is the chairman of this new ANL board? There are four people on the board: Neville Wran, old mate Nifty; Malcolm Turnbull, who is not exactly divorced from the interests of Neville Wran and some of his friends; a public servant from Canberra; and a person involved in restructuring companies. Why? It is a good question. If we start to think about it, we get the answer. The government can trust Neville Wran. Why can it trust Neville Wran, and why does it need to trust him? The minister and this government know that, if they cannot have a board that they can trust and control, they will be blamed for the fiasco of ANL and for all of the money lost by ANL's operations over the last few years.

         That is the reason why Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull are part of that board. They are certainly not there because they have any expertise in transport or in shipping. I doubt very much whether Neville Wran knows anything about shipping. I doubt whether he would know much about anything regarding transport. Certainly, the only contribution that I can think of that Malcolm Turnbull will make to the management and restructuring of ANL will be to try to change its name to Australian Republican Line rather than Australian National Line. These are interesting questions to ask. Why do these people, with no previous track record of involvement in the transport industry, get to be on the board of ANL? The simple reason is that the government can trust them. They are the government's mates. Members of the government know that they will not do the dirty on them because, if somebody that they cannot control is running that board, the fickle finger of blame will be pointed at the government.

         Why was that dramatic announcement made yesterday? We only have to go through the newspapers over the last few weeks to find the answer. This minister knew that his attempt to privatise ANL was becoming a major political embarrassment to the government. That is the reason. He knew that in September, when the ALP conference is to be held, he would cop a hiding on the floor of the conference. He did not have the numbers at the ALP conference to get the privatisation process through. The minister will say, `The reason I did what I did yesterday was that all of a sudden I became aware of the problems of ANL, and I had to act quickly. It had nothing to do with the political furore around the privatisation process and the ALP's national conference.'

         I can assure the minister, as many people on this side of the House are aware, that the problems of ANL did not suddenly arise in the last few months. Anybody who goes through its financial targets over the last few years will discover that it has been a long way off the mark. For example, ANL missed its financial targets by $61 million in 1991, by $105 million in 1991-92, by $26.3 million in 1992-93 and by $45 million in 1993-94. ANL has been trading badly for a long time. The reason for this big announcement yesterday was not that it was suddenly discovered that ANL was in difficulty—everybody knew it—it was that ANL had become an embarrassment to the Labor government in the lead-up to the forthcoming conference of the ALP to be held next month. Those are some of the reasons why we saw this take place yesterday.

         I have to ask: is there not a little favouritism here, a bit of looking after our mates in all of this? What business do Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull engage in? We found out in question time today that Malcolm Turnbull and Neville Wran run a merchant banking business. Malcolm Turnbull happened to be a handsomely employed consultant to ANL before the decision was made to make him a director yesterday. What is going on here? Could there be a little pecuniary interest in all of this? The minister assured us in question time today that that is not going to be so. Let us see whether the minister will give us an absolute ironclad assurance that Malcolm Turnbull and Neville Wran will not derive any financial gain from the sale of ANL through their merchant banking activities in the future. I think that would satisfy a lot of people.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The other question that should be asked of the minister is: how much remuneration are Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull getting for their role on the board? Will Malcolm Turnbull continue to be employed as a consultant as well as receiving his director's fees? These are all questions which have arisen in the last 24 hours since we discovered the make-up of the new board. It is also important for us to understand that, in the statement the minister made yesterday, he indicated that he felt it was possible to bring—as he has said today in question time—ANL back into trading in the black, to restructure it and to get it going well.

         That is an interesting claim, because in the process of making his comments yesterday it was suggested that, in order to achieve that, much of the overseas operations of ANL would have to be axed. If that is the case, then ANL is going to be pared back to basically a domestic shipping operator plus an operator across the trans-Tasman between Australia and New Zealand. If that is the future ANL holds, then its future is totally dependent upon the maintenance of cabotage, which is the banning of foreign competition around the Australian coastal line. It is also dependent on the trans-Tasman accord—the illegal union to union trans-Tasman accord—that bans foreign competition between Australia and New Zealand in the shipping industry.

         If ANL is to have any value in the future, it depends upon government largess to protect it from competition. These are questions which we can rightly put to the government and which the minister can answer in a few moments. If ANL's survival depends on those things, it is going to be at a very heavy cost to the Australian people. As the Business Council of Australia estimated some years ago, the existence of the illegal trans-Tasman accord, arranged between the unions in Australia and New Zealand, cost this country around $110 million a year. So there will be a further heavy price for the maintenance of ANL's operations. As the Salomon Brothers, Price Waterhouse report said yesterday, the likelihood of the $160.5 million being the last of the capital contributions this government will put into ANL is very low. The report pointed out that it may take a further $200 million to get ANL successfully operating in the black.

         The minister now has an opportunity to point out to us what he is going to do to try to fix up the problems of ANL and to answer the questions that have been rightly put to him today. I look forward to the answers from him. If he cannot provide those answers, then I come back to where we started in this debate and say that we cannot trust Labor with other people's money. The problems of ANL, under the administration of this minister, his predecessors and his government, highlight to us how incompetent Labor is in running government business enterprises and protecting the interests of Australians, whether they be ANL employees or taxpayers around this country.

         —The one thing that one cannot help but be struck by in the matter of public importance brought on this afternoon by the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), is its absolute and utter superficiality. This is the shadow minister and this is the party which have put out press release after press release for the last 18 months about ANL. They must have had something in their diary where every month a date bobbed up and they whacked out another press release about ANL.

         Let us look at what the press releases say. They say only one thing and they have only ever said one thing: privatise ANL, sell 100 per cent of it. That was the case at the start of last year, at the end of last year and at the end of last week. The federal honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) said that ANL should have a similar place in shipping to the position that Qantas has as an international air carrier. Just imagine that as an argument for its 100 per cent privatisation, knowing what we know now about its finances. Later on it was said, `Only 100 per cent privatisation will see ANL shake itself free of government and union control,' and, `One hundred per cent privatisation will solve all the problems.' Again with the honourable member for Hume in February of last year it was the same old story:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The coalition has said all along that only a 100 per cent sale of ANL makes sense. That is what the coalition will do and what the Keating government should commit itself to doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the following month again we were told to sell 100 per cent of ANL, and again the following month, every month. Month in and month out we have been told to sell 100 per cent of ANL. It is like a revolving door. But there has never been any analysis of the real state of ANL. There has never been any insight from the opposition into exactly what state ANL is in and what should be done about that state other than this blind allegiance to the idea of selling off 100 per cent of it. It has been the same this year right throughout the due diligence process.

         The honourable member for Hume has come to this chamber this afternoon and spoken to us again about 100 per cent privatisation and what a dreadful state ANL is in. He has quoted a couple of examples to back up his case. He has quoted the union movement and Patrick Crumlin, who is a terrific union official and a great believer in both the Labor Party and ANL. But for the honourable member for Hume to be relying upon Paddy Crumlin to make out his case is pretty thin, just as it is thin to be relying upon no greater journal than the

         Similarly, the honourable member quoted the board. He spoke of the letter leaked to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         of 30 May 1994, saying that the value of ANL's goodwill was going downhill. Nothing has been helping the value of ANL's goodwill but no-one can claim that there has been any real deterioration in the last six months while the government did what had to be done, and that was conduct the due diligence so we had outside expert advice as to the affairs of ANL. It is a matter of fact that after the Potter Warburg report of last year there was a great deal of contesting of the figures which it provided to the government and which have subsequently been made public. Those figures saw the company valued at a range of values from a positive value to a negative value. ANL itself said it was in really good shape. It liked the positive scenario. The opposition take the positive scenario then and the most negative scenario now, take the difference between them and say that $290 million has been lost. That is a fanciful notion that would not stack up in anybody's sets of accounts.

         The reality is that the board of ANL continuously advised the government that it was in pretty good shape. Indeed, the Chairman of ANL, in his press release as late as December 1993, spoke of the fact that there had been a real financial turnaround in the company in its latest figures, despite depressed world trading conditions. He said that ANL's results contrasted sharply with other international shipping lines which have reported poor and disastrous performances during the period. He said:

       <para>
        He completed his press release on 16 December last by saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ANL's sound financial position is reflected in its strengthened balance sheet characterised by the enhanced prudential ratios such as gearing which moved from 130 per cent in 1991-92 to 107 per cent in 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That was at the end of December. It was backed up by the management of the company, who on 10 February said that they had a very good bottom line and that we could expect solid profits in the years to come. They hoped that ANL could obtain a profit of $10 million in the next financial year and targeted tripling that within the succeeding three years. That was what the company was telling us.

         We all know that the auditor was auditing the accounts of the GBE; they are matters of record in this parliament. But ANL's real position is only reflected in the results of the due diligence. Within 11 days of the company giving that optimistic forecast I had recommended to the cabinet that due diligence precede any decision on the sale because I wanted the expert advice of independent consultants to give me a real picture of ANL. I got that advice last Saturday. It is no good the honourable member coming into the chamber today saying that the only reason we are doing any of this is that we realised that we did not have the numbers for ALP conferences. I made no bones about it—you could not privatise ANL at the moment; you could not give it away. It has a net negative worth, on the best advice that is available. This is not a matter of numbers, it is not a matter of ALP conferences; it is a matter of making sound decisions about the future of this company.

         That consultants report, Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers, indicated that the prudential balances are not as the company had indicated and the gearing at 160 per cent is unacceptable. We have to do something about it. We are doing something about it. But we also have to accept that we are doing something about it understanding the state of ANL and where it sits in the greater scheme of things. It is going to be extraordinarily difficult in the ultra-competitive international trade area for ANL to be truly profitable, but I believe there is an opportunity with niche marketing to do  that. However it will depend upon the ability of the union movement and the ability of the management of ANL and the support of ANL's customers in redefining the role of that company and adapting itself to its new and changed circumstances.

         There is no point in having ANL compete head to head with either the Russian companies or the Chinese companies in this marketplace. They have more ships, they have more tonnage, and they are a country mile ahead. But there is an opportunity with niche marketing, as I said yesterday, if we regard ourselves as a spoke rather than a hub in our own right, to have a viable business. I sincerely hope so. It is for that reason that we have appointed this new board. The honourable member for Hume would have us believe that this is the old mates act. I put it to him that we are very fortunate to have people who can make a contribution in these circumstances, and who can give independent expert advice. I believe this is a very good group of people to be tendering that advice in the circumstances of the next six months.

         I have already said today that I do not anticipate that their appointment will last for more than that. They will be renumerated for six months. He has asked me about that and I am pleased to be able to indicate that the Remuneration Tribunal has independently determined—that is the same Remuneration Tribunal that determines our salaries—a rate of $42,000 per annum plus $130,000 in respect of the chairman and rates of $25,000 per annum plus $108,000 in respect of the other two members. There is provision in the event of further duties, that is, on subsidiary companies, for an additional fee of up to $30,000 for one of those appointments. Those commercial fees have been set not by the government but by the Remuneration Tribunal. Quite frankly, if these people on that money having a huge input over the next six months can save this business it will be a terrific result.

We have to repair ANL and make it a profitable operation. We have to redefine its activities. Only then can we think about exactly where it should fit into the scheme of things. I would see there being a number of years of ANL repairing its balance sheet and getting back into a position of real profitability and paying off its debt.

         I will conclude by making a couple of points. The support of the trade union movement is going to be terribly important in the restructure of ANL. I am pleased to advise the House that the ACTU has conveyed to me the terms of its attitude towards ANL in the following advice which I have received in the last 24 hours. The advice states:

        I think that resolution of the ACTU indicates the goodwill of the trade union movement towards the rescue package that the government is launching. We will certainly need that goodwill if we are to get the right result at the end of the day. I believe it is a task worth tackling.

         I have spent the last seven months setting in place the due diligence, getting the results of the due diligence and proposing a rescue package. Whether this rescue plan can succeed or not will depend upon the cooperation of all parties. Only if ANL can be made viable has it got a future. That is a fundamental issue that everyone has to understand. I believe that if we work constructively over the course of the next six months we can rescue this business, we can transform it, we can build it around those elements that are viable or can be made viable and we can deal with those chronic loss leaders that have caused the company so much grief in the course of the last several years.

         No-one will be able to say that this government does not accept full and absolute responsibility for pursuing the interests of the taxpayers and the interests of ANL and a presence in Australian shipping in the process we have embarked upon. It is a very different process to that advocated ad nauseam by the opposition over the last couple of years. The opposition has not analysed the future of ANL in any way, shape or form and it has demonstrated no depth in its dealings with ANL. It has simply repeated again and again, parrot fashion, month in and month out, that we should sell 100 per cent of the company, whilst all the time there was growing evidence that ANL was not a saleable proposition at all considering the state of the world economic recession and the shipping industry depression. I am proud of the fact that I am part of a government that did the due diligence, established the facts and is now absolutely committed to the future of ANL and sorting out its difficulties.

         We need to consider what happened in relation to the report to government in December 1993. According to the minister this afternoon, within 11 days he got due diligence under way. Six months later due diligence resulted in a report that ANL was broke. I find it quite extraordinary that those events could come out, especially when, according to the minister this afternoon, the board said that it was proposing to have a profit of $10 million for this financial year and some multiple of that over the next three years. That is grossly misleading by the minister, as the proprietor of the organisation.

He said that he did not know what was going on. All the dogs in Adelaide were telling him that the bank was broke the same way as all the dogs were telling this minister that the board of ANL was lying and that it was completely opposed to the government's policies.

         Earlier in the year, the OECD in its report made some very scathing comments about the way in which economic reform has been carried out in this nation. Productivity levels in the public sector are about 30 per cent below achievable international best practice.

         The OECD report also criticises the labour market. In Australia, no real attempt has been made to challenge the monopoly practices that occur in the labour market. The report also refers to communications. It notes that, in this country which vitally depends on communications, communications will be kept in a monopolistic stance in a total sense until 1997. All of these factors show a total lack of ability of the Labor government to take on the issues.

         Last weekend, the state premiers were together in Darwin. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could not make up his mind whether or not he would open up the building and, at the last minute, he passed the job off to the Governor-General. However, he dropped in right at the death knock to make a big fella of himself. At this meeting, he wanted to have his way. In the end, no agreement was reached between the states in relation to this matter. If we are to get agreement with the states on any matter of major concern—and the Hilmer proposals which were under discussion are vital to Australia—it must be approached in a cooperative and reasonable way. Labor cannot do this. It is confrontationist and arrogant. It believes that it is right and everyone else is wrong. I am afraid that this process will continue until we get a change in the federal government. We must have Hilmer reforms from the Trade Practices Commission right through to the labour markets.

         The government very belatedly undertook a privatisation process. We produced a detailed program on privatisation in 1988. We were told that it was outrageous and could not be done. In two years, this government had undertaken much of that program and had put it into the budget to buy today's lunch. Our program always said that the money must be spent on retiring debt or investing in national infrastructure. It is in these ways that this government is flaunting the future of Australia.

         The privatisation process undertaken by this government has almost ground to a halt because of the way in which it has handled the Commonwealth Bank. In the first instance, the price was remarkably under-pitched. But it was taken up enthusiastically by the public. At the second tranche, the government went on a book building exercise which nobody could understand. The general public has no idea of the concept of putting in a price, bidding for it and, if an amount is not reached, reducing the price. As a consequence, the government killed the Commonwealth Bank share market.

The government cannot privatise public assets without giving the people a go. They must know what they are buying and at what price. If the government had set a fixed price rather than pursuing the open market tender operation, I believe that that float would have got away quite easily.

         The opposition has a complete lack of substance and a complete lack of policy alternative. For the honourable member for Ryan to talk about the lack of achievement of this government in restructuring this country and this economy is the height of hypocrisy. This country is 30 per cent more competitive than it was a decade ago. It is experiencing record rates of economic growth, a low inflation rate and a low inflationary culture. It is also experiencing record job growth. All of those things have occurred as a result of the fundamental capacity of the Labor Party to take the hard decisions, to take the long-term view and to change the economy into a more open, export orientated economy which is competitive in the world, which exports more and imports less.

They have demonstrated in this House today the problem which goes to the very core of the Liberal Party: it is suffering a profound policy crisis. It is a policy-free zone. It is that profound policy crisis which continues to lead to its persistent leadership crisis. The Liberal Party does not have any social or economic vision for this country and it does not have any hard policies to back up that vision. Regardless of whether it is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) or the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), it is the same old flat tyre. The Liberal Party is just putting different spokes into the holes.

This economy depends upon an effective national shipping line so that we can be internationally competitive. But what do we get from the Liberal Party?

       Honourable members might note that there are a number of matters—bills and motions to take note—in this motion. They have all been discussed with opposition members and Independents and there has been no disagreement. Naturally, the Main Committee will not get through all these items on Wednesday 24 and Thursday 25 August and it is my intention to continue these as rolling matters so that what is not dealt with on those two days will go on the

         —The point I was making when the debate was interrupted was that basically one of the problems that face the parliament in this whole question of Aboriginal education is the same problem that it faces on issues like health and housing—that is, the detailed administration of much of that policy rests with state governments. The other problem, of course, is that it just happens to be a fact that since the demise of the Fraser government the opposition has had no coherent policy or philosophy in the whole area of Aboriginal affairs. That is, I think, not only a sad thing for them; it is an even sadder thing for this parliament and is unfortunate for Australia's indigenous people.

         The reality is that when we come back to education, as a simple example, we find tremendous variation between states and within states and it is true to say, I believe, that there has been waste of expenditure, but that has largely been at the hands of state governments. It is not for nothing that the Aboriginal people themselves have in the area of health decided that they will try to organise their own health organisation, NAIHO, which deals with the problems that flow from dispossession.

         One of the problems that face Australia as a community is that we have never been able to come to grips with the fact that Australia did not begin simply 200 years ago; it has a history of occupation, a history of culture related to our indigenous people that goes back 60,000 years and, despite differing government policies from the days of the early settlement, Australia has seriously misconstrued its own history. We have not looked at the problems of frontier settlement, the struggle of our indigenous people to survive.

         There was a period which commenced in the 1930s during which the popular view was that Aboriginal people were going to disappear and be assimilated. They have survived; they have not been assimilated. They have a culture and a tradition which, despite all the things that have occurred, they are willing to share. They are willing to have non-Aboriginal Australians understand the depth, the nature and the history of that culture, and desperately want them to.

         We saw the most interesting illustration of that when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) decided he would address the Liberal Party conference in Western Australia on the question of native title. It is a great pity that before he did that he did not seek the views of some distinguished ex-ministers for Aboriginal affairs who shared the perception that was part of the position of the Fraser government.

         The Leader of the Opposition easily could have spoken to Mr Viner and other distinguished former ministers, who at least would have informed him about the views of the Northern Territory government in respect of the land rights act. They at least would have informed him of the problems that they as ministers had in maintaining the integrity of their own policy positions. That did not occur. Not only was that unfortunate for the Leader of the Opposition and for his shadow minister; more importantly, it was unfortunate for the people of Australia, who are entitled to have a far more sophisticated view on issues such as Aboriginal education than they are getting at the moment from the opposition. It is to be hoped that in the remaining term of this parliament the opposition will address these issues in a way which I believe Aboriginal people are entitled to expect.

         There is one other aspect of this matter that I think we should look at very seriously. It is not just a question of educating Aboriginal children; it is also a question of educating Australian children. The inquiries that I have made in terms of secondary schools and primary schools in my own state indicate that the topic of Australian history and how it is taught is very much a matter to be decided from school to school by principals and some teachers, who in the course of dealing with that will deal with some of the problems that confront our indigenous people.

         I believe it is absolutely essential that before all Australian children leave primary school, and certainly before they finish their secondary education, they should be fully and deeply informed about the history of Australia, and particularly the history of our Aboriginal indigenous people. Due to the benefits of television and the film industry, we have films such as
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Dances with Wolves
         </emphasis>
         . So the average Australian child who sees it knows something about the destruction of the Plains Indians. They see a film such as

         We, like other nation states, have distorted our history. How many Australian adults have heard of Pemulay, who had to be one of the great guerrilla generals of modern history? With a band of Aboriginals that never numbered more than 18—it was usually about 13—and with primitive weapons, he fought the Rum Corps to a standstill, on three occasions nearly succeeded in destroying the infant colony, and forced the fringes of the settlement right back into Sydney itself. Whitehall had to send out a force of British regulars. If Whitehall sends out a force of British regulars, the Empire is at war. What contemporary or early history of Australia has dealt with that matter?

          History of Australia

         , which described Aboriginal people as amongst the most unfortunate people on the face of the earth. They were described as people who were essentially nomads with no culture, no religion and no tradition. That might have been appropriate to the level of knowledge that existed at the time those sorts of books were published, but now there is another history. It is a history that I think has to be recognised and taught in our schools.

         There is a new generation of people who realise that at this time in our history, if they just put out their hands, they are able to become part of a history and a culture that goes back 60,000 years.

         Despite the things that have occurred involving Aboriginal people, their desire to make the broader Australian community understand their culture, their history and their tradition is overwhelming. I think that will forge a new meaning on the concept of reconciliation. So often when the issue of Aboriginal affairs is debated in this House, there tends to be a presumption that if only they were like us then they would not have their problems. The one thing Aboriginal people have managed to succeed in is to make it very plain that, whatever the strengths and weaknesses in our society, they have kept their own culture and traditions alive. They do not want to be just like us.

         I dearly wish the new shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs all the best because, like former Liberal shadow ministers, she will have to come to terms with attempts by state governments to assert that aspects of legislation protecting Aboriginal concepts are in constant need of reform. She will have to come to terms with the fact that, although the Northern Territory government deeply opposed, as did its colleagues in this place, the handing over of Uluru, clearly the time has come, some 10 years later—it has not moved; it has not been sold; and no foreign company has taken it over—to give it its real name.

         The government in the Northern Territory, on many occasions—particularly at election times—has no problem with dragging out all the old problems and reviving all the underlying attitudes towards Aboriginal people. The tourist industry in the Northern Territory is caught in this perpetual dilemma that faces many aspects of Australian society. When it advertises for tourists from the south or other parts of Australia, it uses Aboriginal motifs, wilderness aspects and Aboriginal music in order to suggest that the average person from Victoria, New South Wales or South Australia should travel to the Northern Territory to see these very important aspects of their society.

         If it is good enough to advertise those things, it is good enough to use Aboriginal names.

         If we are serious about reconciliation, we have to take a far more positive attitude. We have to make it clear to the states that we want value for our dollar. We want to see real achievements on the ground. We must be determined that it is the right of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), hopefully with the cooperation of their colleagues in the opposition, to ensure that that takes place. Unless it does take place, two years from now we will still be having the same old debate. There is this perpetual argument about states rights and money being thrown away and wasted. I suggest that all humans, including our indigenous people, have rights. I have always felt that that point has superseded the continual argument about states rights.

         —in reply—I thank those honourable members who have participated in this debate on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill. I particularly want to thank the shadow minister, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), for his expression of support for the bill. I note the concerns that he expressed during his remarks. He is concerned about the gaps in educational attainment that exist between Aboriginal Australians and the rest of Australia. So are we. He is also concerned that, in the future, we should focus on outcomes and results rather than on inputs. So are we. Certainly on these aspects of Aboriginal policy, if on no others, the government and the opposition are in agreement.

         The honourable member for Braddon also indicated the information that he would be seeking about how effective government programs have been and how near we are to achieving some of our policy goals. The broad goals are to close those gaps and to ultimately arrive at a situation in which the achievements of Aboriginal Australia are exactly the same as those of Australia as a whole in both mean and range. Until we reach those goals, I do not think we can claim that our policies have been completely effective. I expect that the kind of information the honourable member for Braddon is seeking, which deals with the effectiveness of programs and progress towards goals, will be available when the AEP review is made public next month.

         I suggest to the honourable member for Braddon that there is a way in which he can give some practical expression to his concerns. I was particularly taken by the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) during his contribution. He said that one really needs the cooperation of the states to be effective in this field. I invite the honourable member for Braddon to give practical expression to his concerns by way of discussion with his colleagues in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. Those six non-Labor states and territories together form a majority on any ministerial council that is held in this country. We particularly need their cooperation to get the policy on Aboriginal education operating effectively.

         At the ministerial council meeting in April, the Commonwealth proposed a draft strategy and a working party on the national strategy, which the states collectively decided to defer. That is not to say that work has not been proceeding in the meantime. But we await the outcome of a more limited working party that will report back to the ministerial council in November. I am very hopeful that we will have a positive result and that we will have indications of strong and enthusiastic support from the states.

         In late 1993, to make child care more affordable, the government introduced amendments to provide certain exemptions from sales tax to child-care bodies. In general, to obtain funding for a child-care centre and thus access to the sales tax exemptions the centre must be outfitted and operating. This raises the issue that the goods needed to set up the centre will not be exempted from sales tax. The bill will introduce a new credit ground to allow such bodies a credit of sales tax for goods to be used in the provision of child care where the goods are purchased before a body is approved for funding.

         A further issue has arisen with certain child-care bodies purchasing luxury motor vehicles free of sales tax. Although there are few occasions where the usage of such a vehicle will meet the criteria for exemption, it is not the government's intention to allow bodies to gain this level of exemption at the cost of child care. It is proposed to limit the sales tax benefit in the purchase of motor vehicles to the subluxury component of the value. Thus the value above the luxury vehicle limit will be fully taxed. This restriction will apply to purchases from tomorrow. The effect of these amendments on the revenue will be negligible.

         —As the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), pointed out in his second reading speech this afternoon, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) makes a series of amendments to the taxation legislation in Australia, most of which are unremarkable and many of which are sensible and therefore have the support of the opposition. Those matters relating to regional headquarters, the taxation of Australian branches of foreign banks, reportable payment systems and so forth are not matters which I therefore intend to comment upon.

The short statement in relation to these matters is that this system is one which is becoming unmanageable and largely unworkable, and therefore amendments which are in this bill which provide some freeing up of that system are those which are to be supported. However, we would commend to the Assistant Treasurer and to the government a wholesale review of the foreign investment funds and controlled foreign companies provisions so that they become much more workable if they are to remain in somewhat similar form to that which exists at present.

         There are also some provisions in this legislation relating to provisional tax. The legislation provides that the uplift factor for calculation of 1994-95 provisional tax which currently stands at 10 per cent will be amended to a lower uplift factor of eight per cent for 1994-95 and 10 per cent for later years. Given the rate of inflation which we hear the Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), harking back to from time to time in this place, it seems somewhat unrealistic to try to justify a rate of eight per cent and 10 per cent in future years if anything in the government forecast about the future of the economy is to stand true. This is simply a measure which accelerates the revenue collection methods of the government and it is one which again imposes a burden on business in this country. It ought to be amended and certainly not held at those percentages of eight and 10 per cent in relation to activities in this country.

         However, the measures to which I want to address most of my remarks relate to two matters: firstly, the parenting allowance which the Assistant Treasurer referred to in his remarks and, secondly, the home child-care allowance. In this the International Year of the Family, one sees from time to time in the newspapers and hears in the media reports which relate to families and the condition of families in this country. If one came into this place, one would hardly know that it was the year of the family because there has been no debate, no ministerial statement, no indication of any sense that the year of the family means something to the legislature, to the House of Representatives and to the people of Australia. From looking at this legislation we know why the government is so reluctant to talk about the matter.

         We are not simply dealing with a government that could be said to have a benign neglect of families in this country. This bill contains measures which actually seriously worsen the situation for thousands of Australian families. I shall set out in some detail the criticisms that are made of these measures. In this year's budget, the Treasurer, in speaking about the new home child-care allowance to be paid in September, said:

         I turn to the parenting allowance, which the Assistant Treasurer dealt with in the first place. In the white paper, the government announced that it would provide a parenting allowance of up to $132.65 per week for families in which only one parent is employed. While the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made great claims about supporting families and the role of this parenting allowance in supporting families, the reality is that the measure at most will apply to about 118,000 Australian families—a tiny proportion of the total number of families in Australia—most of whom will receive less than the $133 a week.

         In addition, currently under jobstart or newstart allowances, an unemployed married couple receives a maximum of $265.30 per week. Under these new proposals all that will happen is that the allowance will be split in half. Couples will receive $132.65 per week each or a total of what is presently paid of $265.30. So there we have it: a great announcement from this government suggesting that it will do great things for Australian families. In reality all it is doing is splitting the current benefit in half and paying it to two people rather than one person. I suppose an additional administrative cost would be involved into the bargain.

         The home child-care allowance is the measure which takes the cake so far as deception on the part of this government is concerned in what it has promised to Australian families. This Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is full of what might be regarded by the general public of Australia as arcane provisions which relate to the complexities of sales tax, foreign investment and other things which most people would not understand even if they read the bill. Hidden away in these 90 pages of taxation laws dealing with other matters is the reality of what the government is trying to do with the home child-care allowance system.

         Let us go back to what the government is doing and what it purports to do in relation to child-care benefits. First of all, families with two children in institutional child care are subsidised by up to $61.50 per week. This rebate of $61.50 is not means tested at all. It does not matter whether people earn $20,000 a year, $120,000 or $220,000; they still receive this non-means tested rebate. Yet when we turn to parents who have a child and one of the spouses is caring for that child in the home the government was most generous. It said, `We'll provide $30.' What it did not say very loudly or clearly, and what it still is not saying very loudly or clearly, in relation to these provisions is that it will trade in the dependent spouse rebate and give people $30. What is the dependent spouse rebate worth? It is worth about $27 or $28. So what the government is really giving parents where one spouse stays at home and looks after children is $2.88. This is a great, generous gesture to Australian families! On the latest estimates or costs, that would probably buy a Big Mac.

         Not only has the government simply traded in one measure which assisted families for another at a slight increase in value; when we look at the way in which it is doing that we can also see a whole series of problems for Australian families. The national director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, Peter McDonald, has said that up to 200,000 families will be potentially worse off under these new arrangements. This is calculated on taxpayers who at present do not claim the full dependent spouse rebate. He says that, if only half the dependent spouses do part-time work or have a notional income from managed investments, this would represent 100,000 Australian families who will not be better off by this measure which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) trumpets around the country but worse off.

         Part of the reason for this is that the rules for the home child-care allowance are very different from those which apply to the dependent spouse rebate. The Tax Commissioner and tax accountants have been giving advice regarding separate net income. This is not correct according to the social security rules applied to the home child-care allowance. So the tests which apply to the way in which income is regarded under the tax system that currently applies to the dependent spouse rebate are different from those that apply under the social security system applying to the new home child-care allowance. The effect of that tightening up of the income rules, of drawing a more narrow parameter around what is regarded as income and what is exempted from income, means that according to the Taxpayers Association somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 Australian families will be worse off. Yet we are being told by this government that it is doing something for Australian families.

         In addition, we have the public perception that people will receive the home child-care allowance in addition to the dependent spouse rebate. An advertisement which will appear in this week's

         . The advertisement asks: `Do you have a partner? Do you have a child who is under 16 years of age or a child in secondary school? Are you and your child living in Australia? Is your income less than $250.85 a fortnight?' If people can answer all the quizzes, if people answer yes to all those questions, they will receive an extra $60 a fortnight.

         The reality is that the extra $60 a fortnight has partly been traded in on a benefit that is already provided. When looking through this advertisement, it is hard to find any indication—there is none on my reading of it—that this is a benefit given after the government pulls back another benefit in the first place. Here we have a government standing up and saying to the Australian people, `We are doing great things for Australian families. Look at us. Vote for us. We will make your life as Australian families better.' The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) may smile, but I ask him, if he gets a chance to speak on this particular legislation, whether he can justify what is going on in relation to it.

         The reality is that the government is taking back one benefit with one hand and giving something with the other hand. It is doing it in a way in which the rules have been changed so the chances of qualifying for this new measure are less than those of qualifying at the present time. The impression given by this advertisement to hundreds and thousands of Australian families is misleading. If the trade practices legislation, which we heard one of the ministers talk about in question time today, applied to this advertisement and to the government's program, this would clearly be in breach of such legislation.

         I want to talk about the effect this measure will have on spouses who do part-time work. They will have to take into account the gross effect of their income. Under the rules that operate at the present time, they could take into account all  work-related expenses. For example, if a spouse worked one day a week and travelled 10 kilometres each way to her job, she could claim up to $500 a year for travel expenses under the rules for the dependent spouse rebate. Yet, under these new provisions in the home child-care allowance, none of this is allowable at all.

         The Taxpayers Association provided an example of a spouse who has a dependent child and a part-time job, and who earns a salary of $150 a week and also gets a weekly travelling allowance of $120, which is fully expended for work purposes. She also incurs net child minding costs per week of $75. Under these circumstances, separate net income for income tax purposes is her employment income, which is $7,800, and her travelling allowance, which is $6,240. That makes a total of $14,040. From that, she can deduct her travelling costs of $6,240 and her child minding expenses of $3,900. This means that her separate net income, after taking away those deductions, is just $3,900. Therefore, using this example, under the current system, the dependent spouse rebate would be allowed at a figure of $521. That is under the current system, and remember that this is a government which is doing something for Australian families. Let us take this example and see what it is doing.

         If we take the social security rules, that family is financially worse off. The income of the dependent spouse or child carer's income is deemed to be not $3,900, as it would be under the dependent spouse rebate, but $14,040—and with no reduction for expenses. Therefore, the home child-care allowance payable to this woman working in a part-time job in this example is nil. That is an example of a family which is worse off as a consequence of these changes.

         There are other problems with these changes. If, for example, for some reason the breadwinners fail to notify their employer that they are no longer getting the dependent spouse rebate, they will find themselves lumbered with an unexpected tax bill at the end of the financial year. There is very little publicity about the fact that the tax instalments of the breadwinner must rise where the rebate is turned into the home child-care allowance and paid direct to the carer spouse.

One would think that when a change like this is made, which could not only end up providing less assistance to families but also, if they are not aware of the details of the provisions, lead them to a situation where they are lumbered with an unexpected tax bill at the end of the financial year, given the recessionary conditions that Australia has been in, the government might state that in bold writing so that people can quite clearly understand what is being said.

         We can also see that as the home child-care allowance is calculated on a fortnightly basis, the worst case scenario would be when part-time work fluctuated wildly, which it does for some people in Australia at present.

         Nor is there anything in the bill to prevent spouses who are the beneficiaries of unit and discretionary trusts claiming the home child-care allowance for the entire year, apart from the one fortnight in which they received trust income at 30 June each year. What I mean by that is: if they receive income from a trust on 30 June for a particular financial year, and therefore they have income which makes them ineligible for the home child-care allowance, there is nothing, it seems to me on a reading of this bill, which would prevent them from, in effect, claiming the allowance for the other fortnights of the year even though they received income from a trust which may put them beyond the limit which is provided for in the legislation.

There is a whole range of unanswered questions. I thought I heard the Assistant Treasurer say something about some amendments which may be moved in the Senate.

And where there are cash gifts to children that often go into a trust account with the mother as trustee, is this held to be income of the spouse—that is, if the mother is acting as trustee for money which is paid, in effect, to the children, will this be regarded as income and therefore have an effect on whether or not the home child-care allowance can be paid?

Whose money in the first place is this payment that is to be made? There is a whole range of these provisions in the legislation. People without children can still get the dependent spouse rebate and there are questions about whether they are aware of those provisions. If we look at some of the questions raised by the measures contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) of 1994, measures which are hidden away in 90 pages of arcane provisions relating to the taxation laws of Australia generally, we can rightfully come to the conclusion that anything the government says in relation to families is in fact deceptive.

         —It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) this evening. Taxation is not always an exciting subject, but the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) likes to get into the theatre of it and make it as exciting as possible. Whenever we speak in this place on taxation and how it affects families it is always appropriate to remind those opposite about their performance many years ago. It is a good thing for Australia that it has been many years since they were in government. The only growth industry under the previous government was the tax avoidance industry. It is timely to remind those opposite today—because they still have not learned from those bad old days—of how they did not believe in a fair and equitable tax system. That is what this government has worked on over the many years we have been in office.

         Australia's tax system is fairer today than it ever was under the Liberal-National Party regime. Those opposite still have not learnt. One day they might wake up to the fact that what people want is a fair tax system. Through the reforms this government has put in place over many years we have been able to provide a much more equitable tax system without going down the track the opposition wanted to go at the last election. The way the opposition was going to reform the tax system was to impose a goods and services tax on every man, woman and child in this country. I believe that some of those opposite still support that form of taxation, which was soundly rejected by the Australian people at the last election, and rightly so.

         Given that this is our first opportunity after the break to speak about these issues again, it is timely to remind people about those sorts of things. It is fair to say that, although this legislation may not appear to be all that exciting, it is comprehensive. Like many of the government's amendment bills on taxation which are necessary from time to time, this bill covers a range of areas. It will be very hard for honourable members to do justice to all aspects of this bill this evening. I would like to concentrate on a few of the key areas in the proposed legislation.

         As I alluded to previously, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is an omnibus bill which seeks to make various amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax (Mining Withholding Tax) Act 1979 and the sales tax laws. Its purpose is to introduce a reportable payment system to assist greater compliance in tax collection. I am sure that is welcomed by all concerned members of this place. It prevents double taxation in relation to foreign sourced income, it removes the dependent spouse rebate where the new home child-care allowance applies and it provides for income for the purposes of provisional tax to increase by eight per cent in 1994-95.

         The home child-care allowance has been an innovative move by the government that will assist many families directly on a fortnightly basis rather than their having to wait for their annual tax deductions through, generally speaking, the breadwinner's income tax. That is often forgotten by people in their tax assessment; they just put in their dependent spouse rebate. It is not received on a regular basis into the household budget. This measure will help families a great deal.

This government has been at the forefront in the superannuation area. The legislation provides income and sales tax concessions for regional headquarters established in Australia, an innovative area which I wish to turn to later as well.

         The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has been implementing many of those initiatives over the weeks that we have been in recess. That paper was aimed at making Australia an even more attractive place for multinational companies to invest and establish their regional headquarters to service the booming Asia-Pacific region. You would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the activities of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in promoting Australia in the Asia-Pacific region, quite evident over recent weeks.

         The very strong economic growth and development in the Asia-Pacific region has led many multinationals to establish bases from which to provide support services for their new and expanding operations in this part of the world. The term regional headquarters, or RHQ, broadly refers to an entity that provides support services to its associated companies located in other countries in the region and acts as an intermediary between the associated companies and the parent company located elsewhere: for example, Europe or North America. Of course, in the Australian context an RHQ is an Australian company which is established to provide these services for associated companies located in our region.

         In attracting RHQs to Australia, the government was not prepared to just let the natural attractions of a 4 1/2 per cent growth rate, low company tax rates, inflation of around two per cent, record profitability and productivity rises and, as we saw less than a fortnight ago, record employment growth, play a role in bringing business into Australia. True to its record in recent years, the government has set out on a path to truly integrate Australia into the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, we have seen a number of successes in this field recently, with the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, announcing a series of multinational regional headquarters being established in Australia, not least of which was the announcement by IBM that it would build an Asia-Pacific service centre here in Australia.

         The importance of regional headquarters was illustrated by the report by the Allen Consulting Group entitled `The benefits of regional headquarters and the factors influencing their location in Australia' which, for the sake of brevity, I will henceforth refer to as the Allen report. When Senator Cook launched the report, he noted that the regional headquarters of the 65 multinationals which have established operations here generate about 1,100 jobs and economic activity in excess of $350 million every year. Besides these direct benefits, the report noted that many indirect benefits are created by the RHQs, including the introduction of know-how in the areas of business intelligence, leading edge technology, management and strategic links to our region. In addition, RHQs are very good customers for Australian produced goods and services, which augurs well for the need to create jobs in our area.

         A key part of the Allen report was a survey of companies operating RHQs in Australia. This section confirmed that decisions to locate an RHQ are driven by three broad sets of factors: geographical proximity to key markets and growth prospects, quality of existing support infrastructure, quality of life for staff—always a strong factor in Australia—the availability of skilled labour, costs of services, political stability, which this government has certainly provided, and, most importantly, government incentives in the tax system.

         The report found that Australia was a clear winner as far as the first two factors were concerned. The changes this legislation will introduce will enhance this attractiveness by addressing the third set of factors—government incentives and the tax system. This bill proposes to allow deductions for certain business relocation expenses associated with the set-up of an RHQ company in Australia. This provision is in clause 109. The bill will also exempt non-residents from liability to dividend withholding tax on dividends paid out of certain foreign sourced dividend income of companies resident in Australia. This provision is in clause 44 of the bill.

         Although this exception on dividend withholding tax was introduced as part of the RHQ initiatives in Working Nation, it is important to realise that the exemption will not be limited to shareholders of companies performing RHQ functions in Australia. It will also be available to non-resident shareholders of all Australian resident companies which derive foreign source dividend income. These measures will not only attract foreign RHQs but also provide an incentive for Australian companies to aggressively seek new markets, new shareholders and sources of funds in our region and in so doing will improve the linkages between Australian industry and that of the Asia-Pacific region.

         Clause 82CB of the bill contains a number of definitions including management related services, financial and treasury, business planning, marketing, accounting and research and development services. The RHQ set-up costs are defined as expenditure incurred in setting up a regional headquarters that the Treasurer has approved and starting 12 months before the body derives income in Australia from the regional headquarters and continuing for 12 months after this date or expenditure incurred in reimbursing a non-resident associate for expenditure that would have qualified under the other criteria. Set-up costs do not include costs associated with feasibility studies, moving costs between places in Australia or the cost of plant, equipment, land, buildings or similar items.

         The RHQ initiatives are indeed welcome proposals, as the international economy shows tentative signs of following Australia's strong growth pattern over the last 18 months. The signs from the United States are that we are gradually experiencing strengthening growth. As the world enters this period of sustained steady growth, the competition for new markets outside the traditional areas of interest will intensify. Of course, the area everybody wants to enter is the Asia-Pacific region. Some countries in that region are experiencing annual growth in excess of seven per cent. By making it more attractive for RHQs to be set up in Australia, we will effectively be giving this country a head start in terms of establishing the vital industry and technological linkages necessary to realise the full potential of our involvement in the Asia-Pacific region.

That measure needs the strength of commitment from all levels of government in Australia. This issue has been canvassed in recent days, particularly at COAG. Multinational RHQs are discerning customers that will demand only the best in the services and products supplied by local industry and will provide an incentive for Australian industries to improve quality and productivity. Many opportunities will be opened up for existing Australian industries and this will create jobs that we so badly need in Australia.

         The amendments in the bill with respect to the taxation of Australian branches of foreign banks will have a similar effect. These measures were announced last year by the former Treasurer in the banking policy statement. I believe the issue of equity capital funding was mentioned in that policy statement. The proposed new measures will recognise for taxation purposes intra-bank loans and derivative and foreign exchange transactions between the Australian branch and the foreign bank. For withholding tax purposes, the branch of the foreign bank is to be treated as a separate legal entity.

This bill is not just about dry taxation measures. There are many important initiatives in this taxation amendment bill which the government has put forward.

This allowance will be paid directly to the person who cares for the child at home, usually the mother, as opposed to other payments which formerly went to the taxpayer in the couple.

         Division 7 involves a change in the provisional tax uplift factor, reducing the rate from the present 10 per cent to eight per cent for the 1994-95 financial year. This proposal was foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the budget statements of this year. Before I go further, I point out that, at either 10 per cent or eight per cent, the historical reason for having an uplift factor, which is for the purpose of assessing provisional tax obligation, has been overlooked and disregarded. It has been consigned to history.

         An uplift factor to provisional tax assessments allowed the Taxation Office to keep pace with inflation. In other words, inflationary expectations were to be reflected in the uplift factor so that the tax office would not get too far behind the main game and so that it would get what it saw as its first share. Several years ago, Labor managed to get our economy into a state where we were experiencing double digit inflation. We passed legislation in this House to give it the discretion to increase the uplift factor to 12 per cent. At eight per cent or at any figure in excess of the forecast rate of inflation this year, this amounts to nothing more than an unreasonable tax grab. The history of, and the reason for, an uplift factor has been totally ignored. It simply becomes another way of wringing a little more out of our taxpayers in the private business sector and, in particular, the proprietors of small businesses.

         Income subject to provisional tax for a year of income is also subject to the provisional tax uplift factor.

         While I support the government's move to reduce the uplift factor for this financial year, the coalition believes that it should be no more than the forecast rate of inflation. Of course, Labor insists that the uplift factor is highly desirable at this level because it accelerates revenue collection and improves the government's cash flow. Even though the government's cash flow has improved, the cash flow of affected businesses is made worse by an equal amount plus the compliance costs. This comes at a time when the government should be encouraging new investment to reduce the exceedingly high rate of unemployment by permitting reinvestment of cash surpluses in a way which would add to the strength of businesses, particularly that of smaller businesses.

If linked to average weekly earnings or even CPI, the uplift factor would not be so arbitrary and it might, on the face of it, display some semblance of fairness. At present it does not.

         The frequency with which tax amendment bills come before this place only adds to the level of uncertainty as to what is Australia's tax law. Every time another tax bill comes before this place it causes increased problems for tax professionals, accountants and those who are expected to comply with the provisions of the various taxation acts. It is tax professionals, accountants and lawyers who have to scan the multitude of tax laws and try to make sense of them. They in turn advise those who might want to set up regional headquarters in Australia.

         However, the real victim of our national tax debacle is small business. Proprietors of small firms would much prefer to be able to tend to their own bookkeeping, leaving accountants to examine the books only at certain times of the year and specifically after the end of the financial year. Unfortunately, because of the constant changing of the tax laws, small business proprietors need to constantly consult with tax experts. This is an added cost which is part of the compliance cost that I have referred to time and again that small business can well do without.

         Further, as I have stated on other occasions, compliance costs are higher for the small business sector. With Australia probably having the highest compliance costs in the world on all businesses, costs to small businesses within that overall high range are even higher than the average within it. For example, small firms with a turnover of under $500,000 spend on average three per cent of their turnover complying with taxation rules compared with 0.02 per cent for companies with a turnover in excess of $50 million.

Where there is uncertainty under the law, the benefit of the doubt should be given to taxpayers. I am looking forward to the public unveiling of the proposed taxpayers' charter of rights.

        Of course, that is one of the purposes of this legislation.

        The matter at issue, however, is the question of sales taxation in regard to the remanufacture of products in Australia which are subsequently sold to government agencies or other non-government agencies which in the past have received tax deduction arrangements.

         It is the contention of a growing market and a growing industrial sector in Australia that the system as currently applied is inconsistent. As I have just pointed out, where goods are repaired and sold overseas, no sales tax is applied. However, where the same goods are repaired and sold in Australia to organisations which previously were tax exempt, that is no longer the case. The interesting thing is that under the old tax credit arrangements that would not have been so. Those companies, or in this case federal, state and local governments, or non-government agencies such as welfare organisations, which received or purchased repaired goods would have received a tax deduction up to the quantity of tax paid on those components which were part of the remanufacture process.

         When this matter first came before the government, the general view seemed to be somewhat mixed, to say the least. There was a view, which has been put to me by officers of the Taxation Office, that the whole thing was just a mistake. They told me, `Of course this should be in this act. Of course this was just missed.' They said there was no reason why it should not be there and, of course, if we, the opposition, wished to proceed with amendments to this matter to reintroduce it into this act, it would have their blessing.

         Unfortunately, following further discussions I had today with the minister's office, that is not the case. I have been told by the government and by the minister's office that they will not be supporting these proposals. Unfortunately, they did not give me any decent reason why that is so. Suffice it to say that their major concern seems to be a loss of revenue. The interesting thing is that, as we are told in the explanatory memorandum and throughout this entire bill before the House—under virtually every single clause—there will be a minimum effect on revenue. We are even told that in the context of repairing for overseas owners goods which are for export there is a minimum effect on taxation.

         I think it would be reasonable, therefore, having reached a conclusion, to ask the following question: if all these other clauses in the bill are minimal in terms of their effect on tax, how is it that a proposal to reapply in the act a condition which is virtually identical to what was previously in the act is somehow or other going to involve a massive loss of revenue because of the build-up in Australia of a more efficient industry involved in remanufacture?

         What we are trying to achieve is a sales tax credit in respect of parts used in the remanufacture of goods which are then sold or leased to government departments, exempt government agencies and other exempt non-profit organisations. They include schools, libraries, hospitals and other charitable organisations. That is only consistent with what has always been the case with the removal of sales tax arrangements in Australia on the purchase of new equipment or on the purchase of remanufactured equipment, which by definition contains some components which are new.

         The position is even more complex when we consider that this act and the act which preceded it identified quite clearly a whole range of industries, especially mining and agriculture—of which, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be well aware—where all purchasers in those industries, including purchases of spare parts for farm or mining equipment, do carry with them the right not to have to pay sales tax. I put the view to the House that where a purchaser chooses to purchase new equipment—often imported, with all the effect that that has on Australia's balance of payments—as distinct from remanufactured equipment, clearly there is no balance. The fact that it is ignored in this legislation guarantees that we have anything except a level playing field, which we were told by the government on many occasions was meant to be one of the bases of its economic policy.

         To realise the benefits of remanufacturing in the Australian economy, let me put them on record. Firstly, the local and overseas remanufacturing industry, while it is still small in Australia, is growing and is capable of growth, provided it is given a taxation regime which is consistent. The whole purpose of my amendment is to try to reintroduce that degree of consistency which has been deliberately—as I now discover—left out by the government for no good reason. We are all aware, as pointed out by the minister in his second reading speech, that:

       </para>
       <para>
        That is splendid, and the opposition totally supports that approach and policy, but the question we put before the House is: why stop at exports? If the government is serious about creating a viable domestic industry which has the capacity to develop a wide export sales arrangement, surely it also needs the capacity to negotiate sales on a level playing field basis within the Australian economy.

         On the one hand we know there is a growing overseas demand for remanufactured goods. We also know there is a growing potential demand for remanufactured goods in Australia. One of the real advantages is that in most cases those remanufactured goods in Australia are substituted for imported goods or remanufactured goods. Therefore, there is a deliberate saving to Australia's balance of payments in that context.

         In addition to that, remanufactured goods produced in Australia are labour intensive. They create employment opportunities. At question time today we heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) making the point that the government is not satisfied with the level of unemployment in Australia—and certainly it should not be! Surely on those grounds alone every effort must be made to achieve the level playing field of which I speak so that remanufactured products in Australia have the same capacity to be traded and, therefore, to be able to save us our balance of payments problems and at the same time create jobs in Australia.

         Another point which is well worth noting is that, by definition, remanufacturing involves the recycling of goods, which in turn means savings in energy and materials. It certainly reduces waste disposal and, therefore, has significant environmental effects. We are again told by the government that it is interested in all these issues. If it is interested, surely we should be taking every opportunity in every aspect of industrial endeavour to reuse second-hand goods, to replace the parts which need to be replaced and to then put those products back on the market. Alternatively, they will go to the rubbish heap.

My point is clearly this: to realise those benefits to the Australian economy and to enable us to have a stronger manufacturing industry, we must be able to provide the springboard to exploit import substitution to the full and to develop our export opportunities.

At the same time, we need to be able to see the opportunities to build up this new remanufacturing sector within Australia so that it can reduce our demand on imports and, at the same time, play a larger role in export substitution and be able to build up overseas markets.

         Ultimately, we are talking about the need for best practice and an internationally competitive policy, which, by definition, means that we have to remove taxation distortions and not place them in the system, as we are seeing in this case. Above all, we have to remove those disincentives from the remanufacturing industry if we expect it to achieve government policy objectives, as stated in the minister's second reading speech here today, in return for the repairing of goods for overseas owners. We want to do that, but we also want to be able to repair and remanufacture goods for Australian producers as well, and that is where the government has completely missed the boat.

         The issue is really wider than that. If we are going to have a consistent policy for sales tax law, surely we should have a series of exemptions in place which provide for the same group of people over a long time and about which, therefore, people in the marketplace would be aware. Unfortunately, nothing in this material that is associated with the introduction of the streamlined sales tax law suggests that parts for goods sold or leased should be removed from exemption. Yet, as I said, I was told that it was just a mistake, that it should be there and that there would be support if it were put there. However, that assertion will stand until we actually get around to implementing it. The Treasury and others will then come up with all these interesting arguments about why it should not be so.

         The bottom line is simply this: among the largest users of remanufactured office equipment are the three levels of government in Australia. If we do not remove these components from the need to pay sales tax, it simply follows that the end price will be that much higher. What is the benefit of that? I suppose that the Department of Finance or the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will argue that we are robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is really not as simple as that. Firstly, the company selling the goods has to increase its price; secondly, the department, in its annual appropriations, has to ask parliament for more money; and, thirdly, at the end of the day, I seriously question whether the revenue base has really made any difference. As I pointed out, we are told that in every other case in this bill the effects on revenue are minuscule. So perhaps there has been, to say the least, a misplacement of priorities in this matter.

         The sales tax treatment of parts used in remanufactured goods which are subsequently sold or leased has always previously been available to a specified range of consumers.

However, where the same goods are sold as business inputs to the mining, primary production and manufacturing industries, a credit for the sales tax is  provided under credit ground 22 of schedule 1 to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992.

All I am trying to get the House to accept—I doubt I will succeed with the government, but one can only try; logic is one's strongest weapon in these cases—is that, if we are repairing goods which are subsequently exported, a position which we totally support, how can the government seriously and logically argue that no tax should be applied in that case but that such goods should be taxed if they are used in Australia and are therefore not exported? I make this point especially because, prior to the reformation of the sales tax regime, similar goods sold domestically to a range of exempt persons or organisations would not have attracted the tax. So changes took place and nobody was told about them. All we were told was that a terrible mistake had been made and that somebody should rectify it.

         I will clarify what we are talking about in terms of remanufacturing. Remanufacturing refers to the industrial process whereby worn-out products are restored to a like-new condition through reconditioning or refurbishment. Accordingly, what we are seeking in relation to this amendment is that parts used in remanufacturing or for repairing goods that are subsequently sold should remain tax exempt for exempt users. As I said, prior to the introduction of the streamlined sales tax regime, which commenced on 1 January 1993, spare parts used in repairs were treated as exempt from sales tax when the prepared goods were sold or leased in exempt circumstances, including sales to and leases by exempt users. The whole issue is: why should the new provisions ignore those people who have been previously covered?

The recent proposal to introduce credit ground 23 to apply effectively from 1 January gives a similar credit with respect to spare parts used in goods that are remanufactured or repaired and subsequently exported. But, as I said, no additional provision has been made for goods sold domestically.

         The sales tax treatment of parts used in remanufactured goods in Australia, as opposed to overseas, is clearly acting as a disincentive for the remanufacturing industry in this country. Above all, this industry has to be looking for economies of scale. Those economies of scale cannot depend entirely on export capacity. That capacity will grow, but only in line with the capacity of that industry to build up a similar level of industrial output for utilisation in the Australian market. We are talking about a world market and a holistic approach from the point of view of the manufacturers. They will not do something because of some export potential. They have to develop a product range which can be sold in both Australia and overseas.

         —I wish to speak to one aspect of Taxation Laws Amendment (No. 3) Bill. I am glad the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) is with us tonight since I will be proposing some amendments that relate to one particular area of amendments covered by this bill. Those are the amendments referred to in chapter 4 of the explanatory memorandum under `Social Security payments' dealing with the home child-care allowance and dependent spouse rebate.

         I note that tonight the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who addressed this bill, raised for the first time some additional matters, largely by ambush in a sense because neither the shadow minister who is responsible for this bill nor I were aware that the government intended to propose certain changes. But those changes obviously indicate that the government is becoming increasingly aware of the very considerable disquiet surrounding the way in which it has implemented these changes and the sleight of hand that was involved.

         The minister who addressed the matter indicated that the government would be proposing some amendments to the bill to provide that where a spouse of a taxpayer qualifies for the home child-care allowance the taxpayer will not be entitled to claim the without child dependent rebate through the tax system but that the government considers that families should be able to fall back on the without child dependent spouse rebate if they qualify. The government indicated that it will be moving amendments to the bill in the Senate to allow taxpayers to claim the without child dependent spouse rebate instead of claiming the home child-care allowance.

         The import of that is that there will be savings, I suppose, in the way this matter is dealt with, because the without child dependent spouse rebate—as revealed in the explanatory memorandum and is known, I think, to most members—is paid at a lower rate than the amount paid if the claimant had a child. The two amounts for the dependent spouse rebate are $1,188 if you do not have a child and $1,425 if you do. In effect, if a person is left claiming the dependent spouse rebate on the without child rate, the amount will be substantially lower than the home child-care allowance if it were claimed.

         That brings us to the very question that was raised when the home child-care allowance bill was before the parliament—the identification of those sorts of people who were unlikely to benefit from this new allowance or who would receive a substantially lower benefit from this allowance than they presently receive for the dependent spouse rebate. The dependent spouse rebate is paid under rules relating to the determination of income and income testing under the taxation law of Australia and the new home child-care allowance is paid through the Social Security Act in which income is assessed in a very different way, particularly in relation to the income of the spouse who is largely dependent.

         When I spoke on this matter before, I identified a number of classes of families who would be worse off. The government did not see fit to identify those, but some of them included families who are overseas for longer than 13 weeks. I mentioned in particular that that could include aid workers, missionaries, academics, exchange students—a number of people who go away for longer periods than 13 weeks—who continue to pay tax in Australia and who might claim the dependent spouse rebate. Those people would not be eligible for the home child-care allowance and would no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate at the rate payable for those who have children. I think I identified that they would be $372 a year worse off.

         There are also families with children who are dependent full-time students aged 18 to 25 years whose income is less than $1,785 a year. Families might receive prescribed student payments and be disqualified from the home child-care allowance as a result of the more onerous social security income definitions. One of the income definitions of other family payments that people had not readily appreciated applies in the social security area, will apply to the home child-care allowance but does not apply at the moment, as I understand it, is the government's unrealised capital gains test which is applied by way of deeming any such gains as income for the purposes of the application of the income test used by the Department of Social Security.

         These unrealised capital gains or managed investments and shares might be owned by a dependent spouse. They will get notional income from it which is still deemed to be income and can reduce their eligibility for the home child-care allowance. If the person were still receiving a dependent spouse rebate where the normal arrangements for assessing capital gains occur under the tax act, that gain that perhaps can occur would be taken into account at the time when somebody actually realised their assets and they would be considered in the normal way that capital gains are treated under the tax act.

         Others are going to be adversely affected by this approach that the government has taken. Those clients on jobsearch allowance in particular worry me greatly. Their partners will now receive a partner allowance but will not be eligible, as I understand it, for the home child-care allowance because the partner allowance will put them over the income limit, despite the fact that both partners are in fact unemployed.

         We have a situation where the very form of payment that ought to be available to supplement the income for carers at home will not be available in a situation where there are two people in the household who are unable to obtain employment. People have reported that they have previously relied upon the dependent spouse rebate so that they would not receive a tax bill. That was significant in reducing their tax liabilities because the dependent spouse rebate was claimable. In future, because an allowance is now payable, it will alter the very basis upon which their personal circumstances are assessed for tax purposes and will lead to a tax obligation.

         There are some people who receive very irregular incomes who have preferred the dependent spouse rebate because it made it very much easier for them to reconcile their financial affairs at the end of a year. When they are making their claims on their tax return they are finally able to assess what their income is, even though it may have been fluctuating during the year.

         In relation to the home child-care allowance, people are required to estimate their income over four 13-week periods. There is a difficulty that, with fluctuations in income, the amount that they receive will vary. If they have had a particularly high quarter they may get very little in the way of an allowance but, at other times, when their income has fallen away they would get the full allowance, but it does not make up for the allowance lost in the period in which their income was fluctuating. Under the dependent spouse rebate those fluctuations would have been evened out.

         It may be argued that the alternative will now be available to them. They can go back and rely upon the dependent spouse rebate under the amendment foreshadowed by the government tonight, but they would then not be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate that most closely relates to the home child-care allowance. They would be eligible for an amount that is paid at a considerably lower rate and the difference, as I identified before, was $372 in a year.

         Cases of those who have been affected by these changes have been brought to my notice. There is a case involving a person on a carer's part pension which is means tested against her husband's income. She has been looking after her mother who has dementia. She has two children. She will now not be able to receive the home child-care allowance because the carer's part pension is taken as income for assessing her eligibility. The difference in that case is that she would receive only $27.10 per fortnight instead of the $60 that she now receives.

         Other families that have relatively low income levels spread between two partners are in the same situation. Those families will be ineligible to receive a home child-care allowance. It may be that the two partners are involved in some part-time work but have relatively modest incomes. Their situation has to be contrasted with that of a person who might have a very high income and whose partner is not in the work force at all and where the dependent spouse rebate and the home child-care allowance would be available.

         A number of people will be in a comparatively worse off situation as a result of the introduction of this new allowance. The government should ensure that if people do not qualify for the home child-care allowance they should be eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate at the higher level at which they presently receive it, and that ought to be largely in the alternative. In reading the bill, one would think that that was what the government might have had in mind.

         The purpose clause in the explanatory memorandum which refers to the objectives of this legislation says that it is intended to apply in situations where those who are going to be removed from the eligibility for this benefit qualify for the home child-care allowance payment. That suggests that if people notionally are disqualified for some particular reason—income testing or the like—they will still be eligible to receive the home child-care allowance. It may be that the purpose of the government's further amendment is to reflect that. But it does not put those people in the same position that they would have been in if the government had left a genuine alternative available to them. When we reach the committee stage I will be proposing an amendment—I think it has been circulated; if it has not been, it will be—to clause 56 of the bill. Clause 56(b) of the bill states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        by omitting from column 2 in the table in subsection (2), in relation to class 1 in column 1, "Spouse" and substituting "Non-HCAA spouse".
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not sure whether the term `non-HCAA' is correct in the bill. It is probably meant to be `non-HCCA'. That is a correction which those who look at these matters may care to note is required. Our approach to that would be to include as an alternative a clause (b) that states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        a spouse who received home child care allowance within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991 in respect of the year of income or part of the year of income;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to the definition that appears in clause 56(h), we would seek by way of amendment to substitute the following definition:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        " ` "non-HCCA spouse" means a spouse who does not receive the home child care allowance within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991 in respect of a year of income or part of a year of income;'.".
       </para>
       <para>
        That definition would mean that if the person did not receive an allowance within that year he would be still eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate at the higher level. At least that is the purpose of the amendment as I have drafted it. If we have failed in relation to that we will have a fresh look at it in the Senate. It is indicative of the sort of change that we believe would be appropriate. It is in the spirit of the amendments that we proposed when this matter was discussed in relation to the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill that we considered last year.

         I conclude my remarks in relation to this matter by noting that these are the sorts of difficulties that arise when we try to be too smart by half. The government originally sought to obtain political capital out of introducing changes that were intended to suggest that the government was mindful of helping families in which the mother was at home. That was what it was seeking to demonstrate in the way in which it undertook, through its own promises, to change the system and to introduce a new home child-care allowance. The government's policy document for the 1993 election said this:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, a Keating government will increase the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse at home caring for children. The new Home Child Care Allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent income for women at home caring full-time for children.
       </para>
       <para>
        No mention was made in that paragraph that any families currently receiving the dependent spouse rebate would be excluded from payments by that change. It was a sleight of hand. It was always a sleight of hand. The government was in effect taking a benefit—one which was largely available to most women who were staying at home looking after children—out of a concessional arrangement where the family benefited from it and cashing it out as an allowance in the social security system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A number of families were going to be considerably worse off as a result of the way in which the government undertook that change. They were not identified and they still will not be dealt with adequately unless the government is prepared to adopt alternative amendments of the form that the opposition is proposing. I encourage the government, in the time it has left between when this bill is no doubt passed here and considered in the Senate, to entertain the sort of suggestions that the opposition is making as a more appropriate way of ensuring that the bill is equitable in the way it operates.

I think it is important that this parliament be made aware of the feelings of these people. Bill Feggans is certainly an average Australian. That is the way he views himself, and that is the attitude that he takes to the current flag of this country. He believes that we should maintain that flag and that no government should tamper with it. He certainly wanted me, on his behalf, to exercise his right to have his thoughts put before this parliament.

What we are seeing in this country is Australian exporters who are being consistently outwitted by Japanese steel mill customers.

         The very contrast I want to make this evening is this: while Japanese steel mills insist on free market forces determining the purchase price of Australian coal on the eastern side of our continent, the same mills reserve the marine insurance market for Japanese insurance companies when transporting Australian iron ore to Japan. On the one hand they are saying, `open market for coal prices,' while on the other hand, where there are competitive Australian firms available who want to compete on cargo insurance on the west coast, that market is denied to Australian marine insurers.

         The transport of coal to ship, sea freight, insurance and freight forwarding are all value adding services to the production and sale of coal. They are legitimate upstream and downstream extensions of coal production. It is amazing that Australian coal exporters in effect seek the minimum return on coal exports to Japan by selling f.o.b.—free on board—and not seeking CIF—or cost, insurance and freight-sales. We see in the Bevis report on government purchasing that even Australian government agencies are not following government guidelines on seeking opportunities to buy f.o.b. from abroad and to sell CIF out of Australia.

         When we see that Australian coal exporters are in effect seeking the minimum return on coal exports to Japan by selling f.o.b., that contrasts starkly with Japan's vertical integration of the coal industry in the region that I come from—the Hunter. In the Hunter Japanese buyers of coal have invested in coal production. It gives them the guts of the industry—the cost structures. They know precisely what costs and margins there are in coal. They have also invested in coal loading; tug operations to move around the ships that are loading the coal; coal shipping to Japan; marine insurance; and, through associates, they are trying to transport coal by rail to port in the Hunter.

         Clearly, the Japanese are outwitting the coal exporters. The coal exporters, with cap in hand, take the lowest possible return. The Japanese buyers, who are far more sophisticated in financial terms and in commercial operations, are there at every level of operation, value adding for themselves and denying Australia the opportunity. It is time that barriers to competitive Australian firms, competitive Australian marine insurers and service providers not having access to the coverage or carriage of our exports were abolished. It makes a mockery of competition when Japanese steel mills buy iron ore and demand, `Insurance of our iron ore is reserved to Japanese insurance companies, but the coal that we need to put with the iron ore has to be sold on an open market and open market forces should operate.' There is a direct contradiction, solely to the benefit of the Japanese and to the detriment of Australia.

         There is a great need for Australian exporters to look beyond the minimum return on exports and work with other Australian firms and service providers to sell those services along with the products so that we are value adding to the basic product. It is the ineffectiveness of coal and iron ore exporters, particularly coal exporters, thus far in this respect that gives more substance to the campaign by mining unions for a fairer return on our coal exports.

        The total cost of design and refurbishment is $854 902. The major component of the cost is for four new broadcast quality television cameras and associated lenses. The cameras are required to maintain the department's capacity to provide full services to both Chambers and their committees. The expenditure represents the bringing forward of components of a program which will eventually be necessary to equip all committee rooms to the level envisaged in the building's design brief.

These firms include: Cathay Pacific, Western Geophysical, Accor, Lexmark, Tandem, Data General, Thomson CSF, Storagetek, Novell, Computervision, Alusuisse-Lonza Group, Compagnie General Des Eaux, H J Heinz, El Lanco Health Division (Eli-Lilly &amp; Co), Vodafone, McCann Erickson, TecnEcon, and Daniel J Edelman.

        (c) (ii) Of these firms the Government has provided tax concessions to Cathay Pacific and Data General. The Government has agreed to provide Wholesale Sales Tax (WST) relief for equipment owned for not less than nine months and imported as part of the relocation of Cathay Pacific's data communications centre and Data General's field data centre to Australia. In both cases the WST would have made Sydney less competitive than Singapore and the other competing locations for the centre. The Government's decision was taken in the light of the perceived national benefits of Cathay Pacific's and Data General's investments.

        The concession is restricted to sales tax on used equipment to be relocated to Australia and which has been owned for not less than nine months. The equipment is to be used in the data communications centre. The WST relief is to be provided through an exemption in the sales tax legislation to be introduced in 1994. An interim mechanism has been established to provide this relief to similar proposals that involve importing the used equipment before the legislation is amended.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (iii) The cost of the WST exemptions, in terms of the loss to revenue, for Cathay Pacific is estimated at $20-$30 million and for Data General around $150 000. The used IT&amp;T equipment to be relocated for Cathay's centre may be worth up to $133m, resulting in relief totalling $26-30m depending on the equipment's final value and rate of WST at the time of importation, currently 21%, and scheduled to increase to 22% on 1 July 1995. Data General imported $700 000 worth of equipment. In both these cases, however, WST relief was a contributing factor to the investment decision: an investment of over $200 million by Cathay Pacific and a $25 million investment by Data General. It is the Government's view that the benefits of this WST relief in terms of the investment and employment it will generate, will outweigh any revenue foregone.

        (a),(b),(c) and (d) The ABS has never produced a data series purporting to measure the cost of living in capital cities although the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and related statistics are frequently referred to in this vein. The CPI, which measures the change over time in prices paid by household consumers for the goods and services they buy, is constructed separately for each of the eight capital cities and a "national" index is derived as the weighted average of the eight capital city indexes. There are no plans to change this situation.

         Indexes of Relative Retail Prices of Food, Australian Cities and Towns

        up to and including 1990. These indexes, which were compiled in respect of approximately 130 cities and towns (including the eight capital cities), provided measures of differences in prices between localities at a particular date, in contrast to the CPI which measures differences in prices over time in a particular locality. However, their coverage was limited to items of food (accounting for approximately 20 per cent of total household expenditures).

        In the context of a forward work program review, corporate funding for this collection was withdrawn after the completion of the 1988 survey. However, the survey was conducted for a further two years (1989 and 1990) as a user funded survey. The principal users, which were the Department of Industrial Relations, Telecom and Australia Post, withdrew their support following the completion of the 1990 survey.

        When considering questions pertaining to the cost of living, the data used by the Government very much depends on the task at hand. The most widely used indicator is the CPI although, as noted above, this is not strictly speaking a measure of the cost of living. The components of the CPI can also be used where appropriate. For example, an analysis of the increasing costs of health care would use relevant data from the CPI.

        Household expenditure surveys are currently conducted about every five years (the most recent survey relates to 1993-94 financial year and results are expected in early 1995). They provide detailed information on the spending patterns of households; these data can be cross classified with other variables such as income and family size to provide cost of living details for different household groups. Small area data are synthesised by using household expenditure survey data in conjunction with population census data.

        In addition to data provided by the Australian Statistician, the Government has other sources of information available to it. The Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) regularly monitors the prices of many goods and services (such as petrol and postage rates) on a regional basis and individual Departments also monitor changes in certain sectors. For example, the Department of Human Services and Health monitors changes in private health insurance contributions. Where it is deemed appropriate, the Government can commission special enquires to collect data on the cost of the provision of certain goods and services. For example, the PSA has recently conducted an enquiry into the provision of health services.

        (1) (a)-(c) I am aware of claims by the Australian Private Hospitals Association (APHA), Dr John Deeble and Access Economics that private health insurance premiums would increase under the reforms proposed by my predecessor. I do not believe that these claims are correct. For the most part, such claims are based on misinterpretations of the proposed reforms.

        The APHA, for example, has overstated the number of coders who will be needed throughout the hospital system under the proposed reforms. Many private hospitals (68%) are already compiling and coding information, which leads to a much lower requirement for new coders than claimed by the APHA. In addition, the APHA has overstated the information technology requirements of the proposed reforms. Many of the larger hospitals already have adequate information technology systems in place; for insurance funds, processing capacity would not need to be increased. The claim that an average private hospital would need a further two staff to perform tasks such as auditing and peer review is incorrect. Additional staff would only be required if a hospital's current quality assurance practices are inadequate, because changes are only proposed to the form of the information required, not the amount.

        Dr Deeble's estimates relating to the impact of the proposed reforms on private insurance premiums have not, to my knowledge, been presented with any detail as to the method of calculation. I understand that he has extrapolated from current insurance levels at less than top cover, and calculated the increase in premiums which would be required to provide top cover. This does not take into account the full range of the proposed reforms and the scope for considerable efficiencies in operations, driven particularly by more effective market forces.

        My Department has modelled the reforms proposed by my predecessor, and has found that for those with an average level of private health insurance, there should be no increase in the level of premiums for private health insurance under the proposed reforms.

Before that date Christmas Island shipping services were operated by the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island (PMCI) and Cocos Islands shipping services were operated through the then Transport and Storage Group (TSG) of the now Department of Administrative Services (DAS).

        I am aware of the correspondence. As I have advised the Parliament in my response to the Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the Program, the proposed evaluation will not now proceed. The main purpose of such an evaluation would have been to provide information to the Government to enable it to decide whether to renew the Program. As the Program is not to be extended or renewed an evaluation would use resources that can be put to better use. In addition the Program has received more than sufficient scrutiny through both the Auditor General's efficiency audit and the Standing Committee review of that audit.

        (1) No. Unclaimed benefits in superannuation schemes for Commonwealth employees (the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, Public Sector Superannuation scheme, Military Superannuation and Benefits scheme, and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits scheme) total no more than $6 million. Private sector superannuation funds also hold unclaimed moneys in respect of `lost' members, although the dollar value of these benefits is not presently known. There is no basis known to the Government for a figure of $650 million in respect of `lost' superannuation entitlements.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (a) The Government is putting in place measures to enable lost members to trace and claim their benefits. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) Act 1993 currently provides for the establishment of eligible rollover funds (ERFs). These concessionally taxed vehicles, approved by the ISC, will receive and manage `lost' member benefits and be required to capital guarantee their value. Trustees will be permitted to rollover a member's benefit to an ERF if a period of 90 days has elapsed since the benefit became payable. Trustees will be required under current SIS provisions to rollover a member's benefit where it is immediately payable and the trustees are satisfied that a member has not received fund reports for two consecutive years.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The SIS legislation currently also contemplates that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) will maintain a register of `lost' members whose benefits have been transferred to ERFs. People wishing to trace their `lost' superannuation benefits would be able to contact the ISC and have the register searched using their tax file number. They would then be able to arrange to have their moneys transferred to a fund of their choice, subject to application of the preservation rules as appropriate.

        When `lost' members reach eligibility age for the age pension, the benefit would be paid to the Commonwealth as unclaimed moneys. Such members would continue to be able to reclaim their entitlements through the ISC register.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        In my Superannuation Policy Statement of 28 June 1994, I announced measures which will expand the role of ERFs. For example, where funds do not wish to apply the member protection rules to account balances of less than $1,000 from 1 July 1995, they will be required to transfer these accounts to an ERF (or, with the member's consent, to another complying superannuation fund). In addition, funds which do agree to member protection will have the option of retaining `lost' amounts. In light of these changes, the ERF and unclaimed moneys processes set out in the SIS legislation are currently under review, but the Government expects arrangements to deal with the problem of `lost' moneys to be operational by end January 1995.

        (b) Given that the `lost' member arrangements described above are not yet fully operational, the Government is not in a position to form a view on whether any portion of the sum of `lost' member moneys held in the private sector belongs to persons working under false names. However, the use of tax file numbers for tracing purposes, should assist in uncovering fraudulent activity of that kind.

        (1) The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides two types of sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles. First, there is a restricted exemption for certain types of four wheel drive vehicles used mainly in carrying out activities in the agricultural industry. Secondly, there is a sales tax exemption available to registered goods producers for general-purpose road vehicles (including two wheel drives) used exclusively within the production premises or used between adjacent production premises, or both.

        The exemption covering four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry is restricted to persons carrying out activities that are agricultural in nature such as cultivation of the soil and harvesting, but not to activities of a general purpose nature, such as fencing, bore sinking, earth moving or kangaroo shooting. This exemption is unique to the agricultural industry and represents an acceptance of the special needs of agriculturalists.

        The exemption for general purpose passenger motor vehicles for subcontractors to goods producers, including for primary producers, applies to a wider range of vehicles than the exemption covering four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry. However, it is restricted to vehicles used exclusively within the production premises or in going between adjacent premises of the goods producer to whom they are subcontracting. To qualify for this exemption the vehicle must be used mainly in carrying out goods production activities on behalf of one or more goods producers.

        The Government receives many representations for sales tax exemption. To grant all exemptions sought would be inconsistent with the Government's fiscal target. In addition, exemptions for certain persons or organisations impose administrative costs on wholesalers and retailers, are cumbersome to administer for the Australian Taxation Office, and open scope for abuse of the taxation system.

        (2)(a) In 1993, the Commonwealth health officials on the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council accepted in principle a management plan submitted by the Australian Co-ordinating Committee on Organ Registries and Donation (ACCORD). That plan included an objective to increase public awareness of the benefits of organ donation and included a publicity campaign as one of the strategies for increasing the rate of organ donation.

The Government accorded the latter the higher funding priority.

        The Government was also concerned about the impact on the campaign of a debate in the community about the extent to which the family of a potential donor can ultimately decide whether organs are to be donated, even where a record of consent may exist. The legal, medical and emotional issues are complex and while they remain unresolved there is a risk that a major publicity campaign would fuel that debate and create confusion in the mind of the general public.

        (a) In answering this question I have assumed that in referring to a "service", the honourable member has in mind the issue of whether Probus clubs are exempt from income tax under subparagraph 23(g)(v) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Act). That provision allows an exemption, inter alia, for non-profit organisations conducted for "community service purposes".

        Probus clubs however are established to do no more than provide a social outlet for their members, who are drawn from retired and semi-retired business people, senior public servants and the like. The activities of the clubs are not of an altruistic character and so do not amount to "community service purposes" under subparagraph 23(g)(v) of the Act.

        (b) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that some individual Probus clubs were granted exemption from income tax under subparagraph 23(g)(v) of the Act in 1991. These decisions were subsequently reviewed and, in 1992, the Commissioner ruled that this exemption did not apply to Probus clubs. As explained in part (a), Probus clubs have no special features to distinguish them from the activities of other clubs designed to provide mutual social benefits to members and are therefore not exempt from income tax.

        (1) The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides two types of sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles. First, there is a restricted exemption for certain types of four wheel drive vehicles used mainly in carrying out activities in the agricultural industry. Secondly, there is a sales tax exemption available to registered goods producers for general-purpose road vehicles (including two wheel drives) used exclusively within the production premises or used between adjacent production premises, or both.

        The exemption covering four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry is restricted to persons carrying out activities that are agricultural in nature such as cultivation of the soil and harvesting, but not to activities of a general purpose nature, such as fencing, bore sinking, earth moving or kangaroo shooting. This exemption is unique to the agricultural industry and represents an acceptance of the special needs of agriculturalists.

        The exemption for general purpose passenger motor vehicles for subcontractors to goods producers, including for primary producers, applies to a wider range of vehicles than the exemption covering four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry. However, it is restricted to vehicles used exclusively within the production premises or in going between adjacent premises of the goods producer to whom they are subcontracting. To qualify for this exemption the vehicle must be used mainly in carrying out goods production activities on behalf of one or more goods producers.

        The Government receives many representations for sales tax exemption. To grant all exemptions sought would be inconsistent with the Government's fiscal target. In addition, exemptions for certain persons or organisations impose administrative costs on wholesalers and retailers, are cumbersome to administer for the Australian Taxation Office, and open scope for abuse of the taxation system.

        In the period referred to by the Honourable Member, July to November 1993, imports of canned tomatoes from Italy did rise. However, the rise was not due to any `exploitation' of, or `loophole' in, Australia's anti-dumping or countervailing procedures. At the time the anti-dumping and countervailing duties which had been imposed on canned tomatoes during 1992 were suspended due to legal proceedings.

When the matter was heard by the Court the Authority acknowledged that an error had occurred which influenced the recommendations it had made in regard to the level of duties and consequently the `duty' notices. When Justice Lee handed down his decision on 11 June 1993 he ordered, inter alia, that both the `duty' notices and the notices relating to `cause' be set aside. Accordingly, collection of duties ceased with effect from that date.
