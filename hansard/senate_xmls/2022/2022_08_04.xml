              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  I rise to again explain to the chamber the strong measures being undertaken by the Albanese government in response to the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Indonesia. I welcome this opportunity to again inform the chamber about the range of strong measures the government is taking in response to this risk. As I've previously said, this is a serious situation that we now face in relation to not just foot-and-mouth disease but also lumpy skin disease, which has seen an outbreak in Indonesia as well. Accordingly, the government is treating this matter seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've previously said, expert judgement has indicated that Australia faces an 11.6 per cent risk of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the next five years, with a higher risk, 28 per cent, of a lumpy skin disease outbreak. It is worth noting that these are not new risks. The last risk assessment conducted for foot-and-mouth disease, in March 2021, indicated that we already had a nine per cent risk of an outbreak here—not surprising when you consider that there are about 70 active foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks around the world at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the first component of Senator Roberts's motion—and as I previously conveyed to the chamber on Thursday 28 July—I am advised as follows: the exact number of doses for foot-and-mouth disease held in the vaccine bank is considered confidential information in the interest of national security, including to protect against bioterrorism threats. We hold enough vaccine doses in the vaccine bank to cover at least the first four months of a disease response, which gives us enough time to then order more vaccines. The vaccine manufacturer prioritises the production of vaccines for countries that are experiencing a disease outbreak, as you would expect. The Australian government has provided $1.5 million for Indonesia to purchase one million doses of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine. These are expected to arrive in Indonesia in the near future. While I accept that this may not be the answer Senator Roberts wants to hear, this information remains accurate, as it was when I provided it to the chamber last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the second aspect of this motion, I have listened, and will continue to listen, to the advice of experts, including Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer, regarding the government's response to foot-and-mouth disease, including with respect to vaccines. I note that the shadow minister, David Littleproud, said exactly the same thing when he was the minister for agriculture. When the outbreak first reached Indonesia, Mr Littleproud informed the public that he would listen to the advice of Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer. Sadly, it seems he abandoned that view when he went into opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Should an outbreak occur in Australia, time will be needed to determine the extent of the outbreak and logistics for vaccination, if it is indeed agreed to vaccinate. I am advised that, for some outbreak scenarios, vaccination may not be used, and regaining disease-free status may be quicker without vaccination. These are complex issues, and I am being advised by the world's leading experts on the most appropriate approach. I am advised that the choice of vaccine is dependent on the strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus. For example, should we hold a prepared vaccine which was effective against the strain of virus in Indonesia, and a different strain of virus occurred in Australia, any prepared stocks may not be suitable. This is exactly why the vaccine bank contains a number of antigens which are effective against different strains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus. We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government. The most effective use of vaccines at the moment is in assisting our Indonesian neighbours in managing their outbreak. While Senator Roberts may not like these facts, these are the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the final aspect of the motion, in direct response to the emergence and spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia, the Albanese government has strengthened biosecurity measures to protect Australia from a foot-and-mouth disease incursion. These include: for the first time ever, deployment of sanitation foot mats across all international airports in Australia for passengers returning from Indonesia; for the first time ever, declaration of biosecurity response zones in international airports in Australia which empower biosecurity officers with stronger powers than they've had before; biosecurity profiling of 100 per cent of travellers, including extra assessment for passengers who have recently been in Indonesia; 100 per cent screening of all mail items coming from Indonesia; redeploying biosecurity detector dogs to priority ports, like Cairns and Darwin; and one million vaccines to Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth mentioning—because this has been misreported before—that the redeployment of those biosecurity detector dogs to Cairns and Darwin does not mean that we don't have detector dogs in other airports; we do. Those airports were judged as requiring supplementary detector dogs. That's why the dogs have been relocated, and, as some people may have seen in the media this week, they're already doing a terrific job. Again, while I accept that these facts may not be what Senator Roberts wants to hear, these are the facts, and I'm not in the business of changing facts. I'll leave it for others to decide whether they want to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government takes the threat of foot-and-mouth disease extremely seriously. That's why we've taken unprecedented actions to protect Australia's biosecurity. We will continue to listen to evidence and the advice of experts, including the director of biosecurity and the Chief Veterinary Officer, to inform our evolving response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having dealt with the motion, I might just add a couple of other things by way of update. As I have said repeatedly, the response that the Albanese government has put in place to this outbreak is the strongest biosecurity response Australia has ever seen to a biosecurity threat. It is stronger than anything the former government put in place, despite the outbreak reaching Indonesia while they were still in power. No sanitation foot mats were placed in airports by the former government, despite the outbreak reaching Indonesia. No sanitation foot mats were even ordered by the former government, despite the outbreak reaching Indonesia. The former government did not declare biosecurity response zones in international airports at any point over the last seven years, despite them having had the power to do so for seven years and despite the fact that we've seen 70 active foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. That is followed by the range of other measures that this government has put in place, which the former government did not choose to do, despite its having the power to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that One Nation and coalition senators continue to play politics with this issue, despite the repeated pleas from industry for them to drop their political activities and their politicisation of this matter. As I mentioned to the chamber last week, a number of industry leaders have come out publicly on this. Patrick Hutchinson from the Australian Meat Industry Council has said that Australia should 'absolutely not shut the border' to Indonesia:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The continual politicisation of biosecurity in the media is unhelpful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jason Strong from Meat and Livestock Australia said foot-and-mouth disease is 'one of those things you can make sound really bad' and that some of the recent commentary has been 'unnecessarily alarmist'. Ian McColl, the NSW Farmers Biosecurity Chair, said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I see some people out there using this outbreak as a weapon to further their own ends, and frankly it's pretty disappointing. Farmers have argued for stronger, sustainably-funded biosecurity systems for years—this isn't something that's just happened overnight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage subsequent speakers on this motion to reflect on those comments from some of our most significant livestock industry leaders. That's before we get to the comments that numerous farm and meat industry leaders have made supporting the government's response. Jason Strong from Meat and Livestock Australia said the federal government's response to date has been 'very coordinated and collaborative'. Patrick Hutchinson said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">AMIC is very supportive of the Australian government's measured response and believes such a response is necessary in order to maintain strong relations with Indonesia, who need to manage this outbreak with our assistance, not our intervention.</span>

While those opposite continue to play politics, despite the pleas from industry to stop doing so, we are acting. We are acting in ways that they never did in their nine years in power. We have done more in nine weeks than the former government did in nine years, and we'll keep acting after this.</span>

He could have had more to say on the opposition benches, but, now that he's actually on the frontbench and he has to respond to this in his ministerial role, he's so far out of his depth. He lives on the Gold Coast. He's possibly never even looked a cow in the face. He's never birthed a calf. He wouldn't have a clue what he's talking about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about advice, we've all been through the COVID pandemic. He says he's listening to the experts. Well, experts have actually shut down our country and stopped people from having jobs. He thinks that he knows best what's right for this country. He actually said yesterday that it is the strongest response by any government. Again, he doesn't know what he's talking about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has not been the strongest response that we've seen from any government to any biosecurity threat in our national history, as the minister said in this chamber yesterday. He's forgotten about the COVID-19 pandemic, where we actually closed the borders to protect our country from COVID. Apparently the minister has no knowledge of history: in Australia's response to the influenza epidemic a century ago, ships were quarantined, schools were closed and millions of vaccine doses were produced here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his efforts to deflect attention from his misleading the Senate, he's misled us yet again. Foot-and-mouth vaccines stored in the United Kingdom cannot be used to inoculate animals in Australia until they are brought to Australia. Bring them now. That needs to be done. He talks about how there are apparently one million vaccine doses. That is not enough for these figures: 74 million sheep, 26 million cattle, 2.6 million pigs and 1½ million dairy cows in Australia. We knew how many doses of COVID vaccine we had in the country. Why don't we know how many vaccines we have for the animals? Why isn't he telling us that? Oh, for security reasons. Why? I don't understand security reasons here. He doesn't want to be seen to have such a minimal amount of vaccines for the number of cattle, sheep and pigs in this country, because we have nowhere near the vaccines needed to protect us. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also tell you that, if this gets out, we have over 24 million feral pigs in Australia. Probably none of you know that pigs are virus factories. When it comes to foot-and-mouth disease, they produce 3,000 times the quantity of the virus that a cow does. They're everywhere. National parks—you shut the national parks down. You haven't culled them; you've done nothing about the pigs. If the virus gets into the pigs, you actually have a real problem in this country. Then you've got the camels. We have over a million feral camels in Australia. We have about 2.3 million feral goats and about two million wild deer. All of these can be carriers of the virus. Yet you're not talking about this. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important matter. The minister tells the chamber that he has support from these industries. The NFF? Really? Do they really support and speak on behalf of a lot of these farmers? I don't think so. They don't. I will tell you another thing. I just finished speaking with the dairy corporation here in Australia. They are really concerned about this. They said that, if it gets into the dairy herd, it's worse than it can be for beef cattle, because they will not be able to put dairy cattle on properties for three years. It is very hard to breed the dairy cattle that we need for the production of milk. It takes a lot longer. You have no idea of the damage that can be done to this country if we get foot-and-mouth disease in here. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, think of the exports. We are, regardless, clean and green. If we get foot-and-mouth disease in here, Japan and other countries won't take our produce. We will lose the dairy industry. Then there's the export of meat. But that's right up your alley—right up the Greens alley and probably the Labor Party's alley too. The fact is that you want to—</span>

                  </a>  Sorry, Deputy President, but my response has been nothing other than referring to what is before us on this issue. Anyway, they didn't like the fact that I'm referring to the Greens and the Labor Party; they haven't been supporters of the agriculture industry. Never. They haven't supported it. It's been One Nation and the coalition, with the National Party, that have really fought for the agriculture industry in this country. If it were up to those on the other side of this chamber, they would shut down our agriculture industry. They want to see dairy cows and beef cattle destroyed in this nation. They want to see emissions reduced, whichever way it comes about, because it's going to make them look good. Well, they're going to destroy our food security. This is a pathetic response from you. And I'm sick of hearing: 'But what did you do about it? You didn't speak about this.' What a ridiculous response that is. You're in government now and all you can do is throw it back: 'What did you do? What did you do?' It's like when I move into a house and the electricity bill isn't paid. Do you know what? I have to pay the bill if I want the electricity on. And I just go and do it. So it's got nothing to do with it—blaming the other side because of their response to it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you another thing. You say foot-and-mouth is around the rest of the world. That may be the case, but Bali is totally different to other countries, because cattle roam the streets; cattle shit on the ground. People walk in that shit. That shit is then brought back in their clothing and on their person, back into this country. There is a hell of a difference with what happens in Bali, so close to us. Bali is one of the biggest tourist destinations for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, foot-and-mouth disease does need to be considered and looked at on the grounds of the damage it can do this country. The minister said yesterday, 'Well, if it gets into Australia'—if—'then we'll deal with it at the time.' That's going to be too late. Once it gets in here, we will have lost our biosecurity forever. We will not be able to eradicate the disease. You can't just say, 'Well, we'll compensate the farmers.' If that's your answer, then that's ridiculous. The Australian people have had a gutful of picking up the pieces with their tax dollars and with compensation and remuneration paid to so many people because of the bloody mistakes that were made in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can close the borders to COVID, then we can close the borders to this disease until it is eradicated. Yes, by all means, we are fully supportive of stopping it from coming into Australia. But we also must ensure that it doesn't get here—and it can be brought in very easily. Actually, travellers can carry it up their nose, in their nostrils, for a period of 26 to 28 hours. It can be brought into the country that way. What is the problem with closing borders when we did it so easily for COVID? Why not for this? Why not, until it is eradicated or under control in Indonesia, for a short period of time?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question I must ask is: why aren't we giving heavier fines at airports for people bringing produce into this country? They make the excuse, 'Oh, I couldn't read English; me don't understand no English.' Yet we just wipe it and give them a chip: 'Oh, well, that's okay.' Or: 'No, my wife packed the suitcase; I didn't know what was in it.' Until we get serious about border security and start charging these people and really being hard on this matter, nothing's going to change, and we are taken like bloody fools and idiots—they can do and say whatever they want to do and say, and we just accept it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other side, Labor and the Greens, have no idea how serious this issue is. It is so important. It will destroy a lot of our farming sector—the cattle, the industry that we have. And I'd just like to say: if we're propping up Indonesia with this, I hope it is coming out of the foreign aid that we give them—the foreign aid that's well over $650 million. It was about $650 million. It could have been reduced to about $400 million. I'm not sure, but anyway, I hope this is coming out of the foreign aid that we give to Indonesia and is not another handout to them.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>I'd like to say that One Nation does support this. And we have been cut back in our staff of course, saving moneys and everything like that—$1½ million to save moneys to the taxpayer—but you've just given $100 million to Ukraine; you've given $50 million to Sri Lanka; you've given moneys to the South Pacific. So, for us to actually do our jobs is extremely hard for One Nation— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Members on this side care about the agriculture industry. In Queensland, we understand fully that 46 per cent of the national head of cattle are placed in Queensland. There are 11 million head of cattle in our home state, and beef manufacturing is the largest manufacturing sector in Queensland. We understand what is at risk. I don't know how many times those opposite have visited our beef manufacturing industries and spoken to workers in that industry, but I'm very, very aware—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that, as Senator Hanson raised, there are many factors to this. The senator may be inclined to take up the report of the Senate Environmental and Communications References Committee from last year about our feral pig industry—I know Senator Roberts probably did have a read of that—because this is an issue where we need to do our research and we need to collaborate. </span>

                  </a>  We know now that the members opposite are showing an interest in this issue, but for a very long time they didn't say anything about foot-and-mouth disease; they weren't interested in the facts. So now I'm here to correct the record, to make sure that people in Queensland understand that we are taking the steps to protect the industry and that we have been taking the steps to protect the industry since this started. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's remember that this outbreak began under the former government, and we are accepting our responsibility of stepping up as the new government. We know that on Thursday 21 July the minister facilitated a briefing on foot-and-mouth disease for the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That's how seriously we are taking this. We are working collaboratively with those who want to work collaboratively with us. Last week the minister hosted a briefing with officials, updating members of parliament—working collaboratively, making sure that people know the facts and understand where we're at. Just last Thursday, the minister also updated the chamber on the measures to protect Australian farmers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In direct response to the emergence and the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia, the government is ensuring that we have measures in place to protect our industry. For the first time ever there is deployment of sanitation foot mats in international airports. For the first time ever, the declaration of biosecurity responses and zones have been put in place in international airports, and biosecurity profiling of a hundred per cent of all travellers, including extra assessment for passengers who have recently been in Indonesia is happening. There's a hundred per cent of screening on all mail items coming in, and we're redeploying biosecurity detector dogs to priority ports, like my home of Cairns, and in Darwin. Biosecurity is the responsibility of all Australians, including those who sit opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to the comments of the senator who spoke before me, Senator Hanson, with regard to fines for people who break the rules at airports and bring in items that are not allowed. Just this week a passenger coming back from Indonesia was heavily fined—a very expensive McMuffin, as it was referred to at the time. He was fined for breaking those rules, which shows that the system is working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, while this government has sought to be constructive and transparent, making sure that briefings are happening and that people have the information they need, those on the opposite side have chosen to be unnecessarily political on an issue of grave importance for our country. I take this opportunity to remind those opposite that, while they are happy to accuse us of not caring about this issue, of not understanding the fact and of not appreciating how important our industry is, what they are saying isn't actually correct. We know that we are taking further steps. We are considering what actions need to be taken, we are implementing those actions and we are thinking ahead, because we need to be prepared. We are making sure that all options are on the table. We are considering how we prepare our industry for this threat. This disease is something that we need to work on together to oppose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers and the broader Australian community will be watching this place very clearly to see what is happening here. What we saw during COVID-19 in particular was an expectation from the community that the people in this place would work together to overcome threats to our health, our economy and our country. That is what the community expects now. The community, and particularly the agriculture industry, expect people in this place to work together. Of course, the hard questions should be asked. Senator Roberts, I understand why you are asking the questions and making sure that we are being transparent and accountable, but I would encourage you not to listen to the noise from the opposition—who literally did nothing when they were in charge—but to understand that this is something that we are taking incredibly seriously. We are making sure that when the minister is given advice he is sharing that advice with the people who need to understand what measures need to be put in place and he is then putting those measures in place. Unlike those opposite, the measures have been put in place. Under those opposite, there were no foot mats, no powers, no plan—nothing. When they were in power and there was an outbreak, no measures were put in place. But on this side of the chamber, when the minister understands the threat, he takes the advice and ensures that measures are appropriate, are constructive and are not alarmist, and he then puts those measures in place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263528" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NAMPIJINPA PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I rise to support Senator Roberts's motion. I absolutely and utterly reject accusations that we on this side of the chamber are politicising this issue when this current government has sought to scrap the committee for northern Australia which deals with supporting issues exactly like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a representative of the Northern Territory, I find it deeply insulting. It's insulting to suggest that such an important issue is something that we would play politics with. I would also like to remind the President—through the chamber—that, prior to being sworn in as a senator for the Northern Territory, I was very proudly part of a coalition announcement on 23 March that we were providing funding of $61.6 million to boost our biosecurity efforts in northern Australia, which would take our commitment to $1 billion. I also reject comments from Senator Whish-Wilson made yesterday. I certainly would not support his comments around the fact that we're behaving childishly in front of children in these chambers, given that they are a party that supports drug use and actually encourages our school leavers to smoke marijuana, noting the effects that that has in terms of marijuana induced psychosis. So I don't take to those sorts of comments very kindly, nor the government's accusations that we're not taking this issue very seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, as a representative of the Northern Territory, I'm very, very aware of how important this industry is for the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory, the cattle industry and related services industries contribute $1 billion annually to the Territory economy. There are 2.2 million cattle across 45 per cent of the Territory's land mass. The Northern Territory pastoralists manage up to 700,000 square kilometres of the land mass. The average Territory herd size is 8,000 head of cattle. The average Territory cattle property is approximately 3,000 square kilometres and, on average, around 600,000 cattle are turned off Territory pastures annually. And let's not forget the fact that the port of Darwin is the busiest live export port in the world. So these measures are very, very important. It alarms me that Minister Watt is more concerned about governing through social media than he is about governing through his portfolio, claiming that senators on our side of the chamber didn't make mention of this issue through their social media and that that is enough of an argument to show that we don't care. I reject that. I utterly and absolutely reject that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to remind the chamber that, on 15 July, Minister Watt made the following public statement. He said, 'Foot baths are not particularly effective.' This is laughable considering that now they are claiming that they are the champions of foot baths. He went on to say: 'Often people have got more than one pair of shoes. The chemicals for effective foot baths are dangerous to human skin.' These are his very own comments made on 15 July. On 15 July, I happened to be at the Katherine show, speaking directly with members of our pastoral industry, who are gravely concerned about this issue and who, as a result of these comments, were extremely fearful that this government was not taking this issue seriously enough. They were so concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is not us pushing this fear agenda; it was these very comments that sparked action by the pastoralists, members of the Northern Territory cattle association, whom I haven't heard the minister refer to at all as someone he's had consultations with. Perhaps he has, but he's failed to mention them in this chamber, probably because northern Australia isn't important to the government. Hence we had to move a motion yesterday to refer the scrapping of the committee to an inquiry. But his comments created a reaction whereby the pastoralists, the Northern Territory cattle association, then, at the showgrounds themselves, established foot mats for the purpose of demonstrating to this government—well, the fact that they really don't have a clue about the importance of this issue—that foot mats and foot baths are not dangerous to human skin. Comments were made to me directly that they were gravely concerned that we need to jump on this, that we need to bring to the attention of the wider community of Australians that citric acid is a naturally occurring acid. You can use it in your everyday households. But clearly the government doesn't have any idea about the fact that this could certainly be a biosecurity measure to support the industry and that it is an effective tool when used in this way and is not harmful to human skin—or to animal skin, for that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to give a reminder—obviously the minister is not here, but I'm sure he will catch up with these comments later—that it was these very comments, made on 15 July, that prompted the industry to demonstrate, out of fear and out of deep concern for the industry, that he was wrong and that they needed support. It demonstrated that the government was not taking this seriously enough. That was on 15 July. Since the minister is more concerned about governing through social media, he might want to join my Facebook page and view the post I made on 15 July about speaking to a vet who delivered a session on the biosecurity concern that day, at the show in Katherine, on the importance of this government acting promptly to deal with this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I will not accept that we on this side of the chamber and those of us who represent northern Australia and the interests of those within the industry are playing politics with this issue. We are gravely concerned, because it is our backyards that are in the direct firing line should this get out of hand. It is our backyards that will suffer. It is those within our industry. And we know this will have further effects within our industry. When our pastoralists, when our agriculturists, when our farmers are down on their luck, it's not just about the industry and how it'll affect the wider Australian economy. This is about people's livelihoods, this is about their lives, this is about their ability to care and look after their families. When people feel so destroyed under these sorts of circumstances, it can very well lead to issues such as suicide. We don't want to see that occur for anyone within our pastoralist industries, within our cattle industries. So I find it deeply insulting that it would be suggested that we're playing politics on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I ask this government to take very seriously the issues relating to northern Australia. We need a voice in these chambers just like everybody else. We are affected by decisions made and decisions that aren't made by this government going forward. It is our responsibility to hold this government to account, and that is exactly what we are doing on behalf of these industries, on behalf of the little people and on behalf of those who would be affected.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  In serving the people of Queensland and Australia, my intention in advancing this motion was to protect the people's interests from the economic devastation that will result from foot-and-mouth disease if it enters Australia. There is no time to waste. It is a distinct possibility that, given the substandard response from this government, foot-and-mouth may be in Australia before the next sitting. Suspending standing orders to debate this matter today was essential, and I thank Senator Gallagher and the government for this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Whish-Wilson yesterday suggested that this matter could wait for discussion at the inquiry into the government's foot-and-mouth response. No, it can't. That's weeks away. We need to act now to get these vaccines into Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the minister appeared on radio earlier this week and alluded to the 'scaremongering' coming from some people around this issue. It is not scaremongering to want to save the lifeblood of hundreds of communities in rural Australia. It is not scaremongering to want to preserve $80 billion in exports. It is not scaremongering to want Australia to provide our beautiful red-meat protein into the international market to feed the world. It is not scaremongering to want to protect the thousands of jobs, including union jobs in transport, that the livestock industry supports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why on earth did the Prime Minister give the job of agriculture minister to an accountant and lawyer from the city? That decision was a gross insult to the Australian agriculture sector. The minister's actions in his very first test show that the minister hasn't a clue. The minister misleads and uses false slurs to cover up his own deficiencies and to divert attention from his deficiencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister misled the Senate and the public when he answered my question on bringing vaccines to Australia just in case. The minister replied that this would cause Australia to be considered as 'having foot-and-mouth disease'—rubbish! Having the vaccines here is not considered having foot-and-mouth. Using them is, and clearly these vaccines would not be used unless we had an actual outbreak. I've repeatedly called on the minister to correct his reply, and he continues to ignore that request. Truth doesn't matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister misled the Senate when saying vaccine production had to wait until we knew the strain that had arrived in Australia. That specious reply ignores the likelihood that the strain we could have in Australia is going to be the same strain present now in Bali. If we're making vaccines for Bali, make some more for us and store those vaccines in Australia, ready for any outbreak that comes here from Bali. Minister Watt's answer ignores the simple question: if we need to know the strain before making a vaccine, what are the million doses of foot-and-mouth vaccine Australia is storing in the UK right now that he told us about?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister called into question my support for vaccines yesterday in another diversion. The minister was clearly not listening. In my question last Thursday, I did reassure the public that these vaccines are safe. The first thing I did in drafting my questions was to check that and to add the fact that it does look after people's safety. I have never spoken against vaccination. I have spoken strongly against, and will continue to speak strongly against, experimental gene based treatments for humans, with grossly inadequate safety testing. Experimental vaccine injections have caused so many horrendous human injuries and deaths the government has had to implement a compensation scheme. In contrast, the foot-and-mouth vaccine is not an mRNA gene based vaccine. It is a normal vaccine, a real vaccine. According to New Zealand health authorities, it's safe to consume meat and milk from a vaccinated animal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So once again for clarity, before the minister misrepresents me again, I'm suggesting we get these one million doses of vaccine that we already own, and any others we need to produce for this strain, stored here in Australia, ready to vaccinate 48 hours after a foot-and-mouth outbreak occurs, should one occur. Taking this precaution will meet the procedure in the minister's own manual. It's on page 18 of the foot-and-mouth AUSVETPLAN edition 3 manual, in case the minister wants to look it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the minister to explain why these vaccines are being stored in the UK rather than Australia. The minister has failed to explain this very strange decision, despite repeated requests. In the event of an outbreak, it will take seven days to get the vaccines here from the UK. Yet vaccination is supposed to start after 48 hours. After one week it will be too late. The livestock industry will be done for. He said he had tabled a response. He did, but it was scant and did not answer my basic questions. Was he really badly advised or did he lie? We need the truth. People need the truth. There are two issues now thanks to Senator Watt: foot-and-mouth and trust and truth, because of what he has done and not done and what he's said and not said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's briefing on foot-and-mouth last Tuesday appears to have made a factual error. It was in a casual reply, so I'm only going to mention this in passing. The comment was made that foot-and-mouth disease stays resident on hard surfaces for hours. The American College of Veterinary Pathologists briefing sheet on foot-and-mouth puts the residence period at one month. Between hours and one month, there is a hell of a difference—a huge difference. If it's indeed one month then the protocols we're following for foot-and-mouth need to be much stronger, more like the disinfectant protocols the government rushed to implement for COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these issues can be covered during the Senate inquiry. Vaccines, though, cannot wait. We must have them here now. We must have stronger airport screening now. How can it be that, after all these weeks the virus has been in Indonesia, we still have several international flights arriving directly from Indonesia all at the same time and then no flights for hours? If you do not have the staff to check every passenger from infected areas, Minister, here's an idea: work with the airlines to stagger their arrivals so we can screen every single person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no confidence that this minister, in being in charge of the department, is working from a set of protocols that are designed to stop foot-and-mouth. Rather, these protocols seem to be about looking as if government tried to stop foot-and-mouth. Perhaps this has something to do with the Left's policy to reduce livestock to save on carbon dioxide production. A 43 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide output below 2005 levels by 2030 must include substantial reductions from agriculture. I'll speak to this absolute nonsense, this garbage, on many occasions in the years ahead. For today, let me say that cows are not climate vandals. Graziers are wonderful custodians of the land, as Senator Nampijinpa Price just pointed out. The government is not a wonderful custodian of the land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware there is work that suggests that foot-and-mouth will not spread amongst feral pigs and other feral animals that can get foot-and-mouth because of the sparse population. What utter rubbish! These researchers-for-hire clearly have not been to the national parks I've have been to. Nobody in the government seems to care that infestations of pests in national parks encroach on farmland, putting hardworking farmers under enormous strain, when all they want to do is grow food and fibre to feed and clothe the world. Why the political Left want to stop farmers feeding and clothing the world is beyond me—and it's clearly beyond Senator Nampijinpa Price. I know your climate gods need the ritual sacrifice of farmers to reach a target that makes no scientific sense, no moral or ethical sense, no human sense. And, really, how can rewilding productive farmland be more desirable than feeding and clothing the world and the people on our planet? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This agenda dovetails very nicely with Premier Andrews's recent agriculture bill, which allows the Premier to declare quarantine on part or all of rural Victoria based on the threat of a disease outbreak. Animals can be culled on the threat of getting a disease. Farmers can be told what they can and can't produce. Lockdowns can be hard border lockdowns extending for years. Victoria is coming for their graziers in the name of sustainability. All it will take is one disease outbreak. What could that outbreak be? If every rural media outlet in the bush is not getting onto their local Labor member or Greens candidates and asking them, 'What is the go here?' then I don't know why they're not doing it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a story here. It's a story that is so much more than an inexperienced minister with no knowledge of his portfolio tripping over the first hurdle. It's more than a minister who refuses to accept he's made a mistake and, as a result, refuses to fix it. That's not honest. It's more than Australian farmers being thrown under the sustainability bus by wealthy city dwellers anxious to make others pay for their climate religion. It is about the very future of our Australian agricultural sector, and that's terrifying. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Watt made this an issue by misleading the Senate. Quoting others about foot-and-mouth disease does not change a thing with what's happening with the government. Continually derailing the discussion and diverting the discussion onto what other people are doing or not doing does not answer questions. It shows the man lacks accountability and responsibility. And I will continue to do my job for the people. I've been elected by the people—not the people that Senator Watt quoted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easier to get a human being vaccinated in this country than to get a cow vaccinated. We have one flag above this parliament. We are one community and we are one nation. Labor, in its policy on foot-and-mouth disease, is a clear and present danger to agriculture. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I do have a lot of respect for Senator Roberts in this place, but I must say that some of the line of questioning that's been put to my friend Senator Murray Watt as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is quite questionable. It's fair to say I don't agree with the line of inquiries that Senator Roberts has put to Minister Watt. It is important to note that Minister Watt, time and time again, for the last two weeks in this place has been open, has been honest and has put all the facts on the table in this chamber, before all senators, before the Australian people—and not just here in parliament but outside this building as well—on numerous occasions. But, with the greatest respect, I think Senator Watt has tried to answer Senator Roberts's questions and no doubt will continue to answer his questions as they come to him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is not pretending that this is an easy issue. But what we have said for the last two months that we've been in power—and it is important to always put things into context; context is so important in this place. It is so interesting to see that those opposite, particularly the opposition, have all become experts in foot-and-mouth disease. For 9½ years, they had many opportunities to fix our biosecurity arrangements, particularly around how we fund biosecurity in this country. I know Senator Whish-Wilson has been a longstanding member of the rural and regional affairs and transport committee, which has held several inquiries into all things agriculture, and I look forward to his contributions later this morning. The government of the day failed to seriously address the issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just Labor saying this. This is not the Australian Greens saying this. These are peak bodies from agriculture, like the National Farmers Federation. Supposedly, those opposite don't represent farmers now, but they did 2½ months ago. GrainGrowers have come out and congratulated this government for finally establishing an inquiry into biosecurity. AgForce have come out and congratulated this government on finally doing something about addressing the inadequacies of our biosecurity funding arrangements. There is a list of other peak bodies around the country—cattle, the Red Meat Advisory Council and so many others that, quite frankly, I could spend the next seven minutes of my time listing them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from those opposite that there are some farmers who are quite concerned: yes, and rightly so. But it hasn't helped that those opposite have created a bit of a political campaign for their own internal purposes. They have created this hysteria, this panic, this sense that the sky is going to fall in if we don't do something now, without actually being honest with the constituency that they claim to represent—Australian farmers—about the fact that we are actually doing something. The Australian government is actually doing something to address the foot-and-mouth disease threat. Touch wood, we have not had that outbreak here in Australia, and we are working very strongly with our friends in Indonesia, particularly in Bali, to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease does not come into this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth putting this on the record about these foot mats. The opposition talk about these mats like somehow they're going to stop everything from coming into the country. If they were so concerned about these sanitation foot mats—not foot baths too, for the record, Deputy President, but foot mats—why didn't they put an order in and actually bring these foot mats into the country? Just like with the vaccine rollout that we had during COVID, you can't expect these foot mats to just arrive overnight at our front door. You've actually got to plan and put the orders in to get these mats from overseas. We don't actually have a domestic manufacturing sector in this country anymore; therefore, we can't produce these mats in the country, so we are reliant on overseas supply chains. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the National Party do for 9½ years, when they had the portfolio of agriculture, in terms of these foot mats? Nothing. Same old business: 'Wait till an outbreak occurs, and then we'll see and assess what the situation is.' They had the opportunity to actually address the concerns that they are now raising and blaming this government for. This government has only been in for two months and is now trying to fix their mess, which they have left us with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to put the facts on the table. Having the vaccines—well, we do have enough vaccines to address the initial shock should that virus get into the country, but I think it's also important to get the vaccines overseas into Indonesia, where there is a threat to our agriculture industry. I'm not going to cop the scaremongering, the political stunt, that the opposition—the National Party particularly—have collectively put on today in this place, and neither are other Labor senators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to ask the question: when are the opposition going to listen to the experts? The experts that they relied on when they were last in government are now criticising them. When are you, as the opposition, going to listen to the same experts that government is relying on and listen to the peak bodies—the National Farmers Federation and the many other peak bodies—that have said: 'Labor, you are doing the right job. You are doing what we have been calling for: consulting, working with Indonesia, working with industry'—</span>

                  </a>  I'll take the interjection from across the aisle that we've been too slow. We haven't been too slow. We've actually been doing what industry expects of us and what industry has actually called on us to do, and we now have the strongest biosecurity measures ever in the history of Australia. So well are our measures working that foot-and-mouth has not arrived here. In fact, we picked up a traveller recently, as senators across the aisle would know, who had a dodgy cheeseburger. So well are our measures working that people are saying, 'Yes, we do have products that we should not be bringing into this country.' We've now got new ads on aeroplanes warning travellers to Australia that, should they arrive here with such products, they will receive a hefty fine. Someone who is bringing back a Big Mac or a Happy Meal will cop a $2,600 fine because they brought in some products they should not have brought into this country. Again, Senator Watt should be commended for the work that he has been doing, his department has been doing and our biosecurity officers have been doing to protect our borders and our agriculture industry, because it is so important that we protect our agriculture industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also put on the record that we are now screening every single piece of material—mail, that is—coming from Indonesia and China. That should also be noted in this place. We've also reviewed the import permits of Indonesian products that may carry foot-and-mouth disease. The Australian government is now providing direct support to the Indonesian government to purchase vaccines to control the outbreak over in Indonesia. We also acknowledge that Meat &amp; Livestock Australia deserve additional funding. That is why we are providing the additional funding that it deserve to help coordinate industry's response to the outbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is advice about our biosecurity responsibilities that I also want to flag in this place today. New biosecurity laws were enacted back in, I think, 2016, yet this is the first time an Australian government is using them. The same powers that the Liberal and National parties had but chose not to use in 2016 are now being used by the Labor government for the very first time. When those opposite had the chance to actually fix the mess that our biosecurity arrangements were in, they did absolutely nothing. That is why I'm so very proud that this Senate, with the support of many in this place, agreed to my motion to have an inquiry into our biosecurity arrangements, and I look forward to working with all senators in this place to actually address our biosecurity arrangements once and for all.</span>

                  </a>  This is a very serious issue that the country confronts, and Minister Watt has been detailing the thorough and urgent actions that he has taken as the minister responsible in the Albanese government. But it's also 'exhibit A' in evidence that the opposition have learned nothing from this election campaign. The way they have come into the chamber today and the way they have done this over the first two weeks of sittings show that they have learnt nothing from the election result. They've also observed nothing over the last three years in how the Australian people react to these sorts of issues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the opposition, all we have seen is politics. They have played politics with this issue consistently since they've been in opposition and they have actually done nothing constructively, have offered no solutions, to help the country get through it. I think it goes to show that they've learnt nothing from their time in government and nothing from the election campaign, and they're going to continue on. Well, we are not going to fall into that trap. We are going to do the right thing by the Australian people. We're going to act in the national interest, and we are also going to do the right thing by the country and work collaboratively with the industry as well. There have been numerous quotes that my colleagues have raised about them being supportive of the action that we are taking. But we all remember what the government was like. We all remember that they were rejected at the last election campaign because, on any issue that confronted them, they always played politics with it. It was always politics first; the national interest played a very distant role in that regard. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Watt has continuously answered questions in this chamber, answered questions through the media and explained the actions that this government is taking to deal with this issue. It's really disappointing that the opposition, teaming up with One Nation, have learned nothing from the last election campaign and are going to continue to play politics with this issue when we actually need a national response to this with everyone working constructively together and putting the national interest of the country first. </span>

I'd also like senators to reflect on the fact that I understand that it's important to put pressure on the government, to needle them, to make sure there's transparency, so they know they're being watched closely in acting to do everything they possibly can. That's a critical part of politics, but it's sounding to me in this chamber this morning, when we've had debate ranging from marijuana psychosis, through to mad Mal's vaccine denial and a whole range of other—</span>

                  </a>  I did specifically withdraw that comment. I'll say: Senator Roberts's and One Nation's vaccine denial, as pointed out by the minister yesterday, is hardly the political party you want to be taking advice from. There has been a complete disregard of experts and there have been the comments that somehow the experts who have given evidence to senators and MPs about the risk of this being spread by a feral species are scientists for hire—really? It's almost sounding like the opposition wants some kind of foot-and-mouth outbreak so they can make political advantage out of it, which I think is appalling. I think it is absolutely appalling. You would be forgiven for thinking, if you'd listened to the quality of debate we've had from these people on the other side of the chamber yesterday morning and this morning, that actually they want an outbreak in this country so they can turn it to their political advantage. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299352" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEWART</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. As Labor said ahead of the federal election, we will always work to provide certainty and clarity on tax for Australian businesses and working families, particularly during challenging economic times for our country and around the world. Our focus has always been and will always be on making sure we build an economy that works for people, not the other way around; an economy that fosters aspiration, hope and opportunity; and an economy that holds no-one back, supported by a tax system that provides certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 is going to provide certainty to stakeholders about their tax obligations and benefit entitlements, reduce risks to the Commonwealth associated with uncertainty in existing laws and limit the retrospective application of proposed new laws. This bill contains a number of measures across four schedules: schedule 1, the recovery grants for Cyclone Seroja; schedule 2, transitional provisions relating to the repeal of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993; schedule 3, income tax and withholding exemptions for the FIFA Women's World Cup; and schedule 4, modernising business register delays and other minor and technical amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some more about schedule 1: it will provide an income tax exemption for qualifying grants made to primary producers and small businesses affected by Tropical Cyclone Seroja, which happened in April 2021. Tropical Cyclone Seroja had a devastating impact on a number of communities in Western Australia. Affected primary producers and small businesses were eligible for recovery grants of up to $25,000, which were activated as a category C measure under the joint Commonwealth-state Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements 2018. In 2021-22 the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook included a measure to make these recovery grants non-accessible, non-exempt income for tax purposes. Schedule 1 makes these qualifying grants non-accessible, non-exempt income for tax purposes where those grants relate to the impact of Tropical Cyclone Seroja. Income tax will not be applied to these grants. These grants provide additional support to communities as they build and recover following the devastating event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2: in 2017 the then government agreed to the recommendation of the Ramsay review to establish the Australian Financial Complaints Authority to replace the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The SCT ceased operations on 31 December 2020, with six remaining cases successfully transferred to the AFCA. The SCT formally closed on 5 March 2022. These amendments ensure that administrative arrangements are in place to allow the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to undertake ongoing management of SCT records and any outstanding cases in the Federal Court to be appropriately remitted back to the AFCA. Complaints will not be adversely affected, as the AFCA is now the primary external dispute resolution body responsible for handling superannuation related complaints and is appropriately resourced to resolve outstanding SCT complaints. The AFCA Act will be amended to allow for the transfer of SCT records and documents to ASIC for ongoing records management and will also allow for the Federal Court to remit appealed cases back to the AFCA, where previously these had been remitted to the SCT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4: along with a number of technical and minor amendments, schedule 4 makes changes to the legislation that support the Modernising Business Registers—the MBR—program. The program is significantly delayed and will be well over budget. The MBR program will deliver an important piece of economic infrastructure that will be leveraged in several of our policy objectives. Our business registry IT systems are well beyond their end of life. The outdated nineties-era technology in which the current business registry now resides isn't just clunky and inefficient; it's simply not equipped to deal with modern-day cyberthreats. The Modernising Business Registers program was supposed to cost just under half a billion dollars and be completed in full by 2024. Early estimates suggest that the full delivery of the program may cost up to $1.5 billion and the full transfer of functions will no longer be able to occur until 2026. The previous Liberal-National government had plenty of opportunities to level with the Australian people about the time and cost delays in implementing this program that they were aware of under their watch. This billion-dollar stuff-up is now for the new federal government to fix, and we are in the early days of assessing options. This bill delays the full transfer of functions to the new registrar to 1 July 2026. We will keep Australians informed as we go about the important business of getting this project back on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is schedule 3 of this bill that will by far have the most influential impact in our community, particularly on women and girls. As many of us in this place know, the FIFA Women's World Cup will be held in Australia and New Zealand in 2023. As part of a package of commitments to host the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023, the government is providing an income and withholding tax exemption to FIFA and a local Australian subsidiary. The exemption will be limited to income earned in relation to event activities—for example, in planning, holding and winding up the event. This will strengthen Australia's reputation as a host for major international sporting events and play a genuine and meaningful role in promoting women's sport. It is through major sporting events that we can inspire the next generation of young people, particularly young women, to participate in sport, and when it comes to major events for women and girls there is, frankly, nothing as big, as watched and as supported at the Women's World Cup. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FIFA Women's World Cup is the largest women's sporting event in the world. The 2019 event in France was viewed by an incredible 1.12 billion viewers across the world, with next year's event in Australia likely to be the biggest ever, with many firsts. It will be the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere and the first to be co-hosted by two federations—the Asian Football Confederation, or AFC, which Australia belongs to, and the Oceania Football Confederation, or OFC, which New Zealand belong to. With 144 women's national teams entering the original qualification process, next year's tournament has been expanded for the first time to consist of 32 teams, who will play a record 64 games over five weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2019 World Cup in France was viewed by an incredible 1.12 billion viewers globally, and next year's event in Australia will be bigger than that. The 2019 final between France and the USA was viewed by 63 million people across the world. To put this in perspective, the men's AFL grand final in 2021 between Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs was viewed by 3.91 million people nationally, and day one of last year's men's Boxing Day Test for the cricket was viewed by 1.26 million people nationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the event to be held from 20 July to 20 August in 2023, Football Australia has forecast the economic and social benefit of hosting the tournament to be at least $460 million. It is supporting thousands more jobs, skills and opportunities, especially for our tourism sector as it continues to recover from the impacts of the pandemic. The tournament will also provide tremendous trade and investment opportunities which we can leverage, particularly across our host states and cities. For my home state of Victoria, the event will provide significant benefits. Led by former Victorian Minister for Tourism and Major Events and for Sport, John Eren, Victoria proudly secured six matches to be held in Melbourne's AAMI Park, which will also feature the Matildas. Along with the new $115 million dollar home of women's football training base, which is currently being constructed at La Trobe University in Bundoora, Melbourne, it will be the epicentre of this global event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will be proudly represented at the tournament by the Matildas, ranked as the No. 1 sporting team in Australia for emotional connection and familiarity. Captained by 2018 Young Australian of the Year Sam Kerr, the Matildas will be cheered on by all Australians to go all the way, and will be sure to inspire the next generation of women and girls to play football and to get healthy and active. Matildas captain, Sam Kerr, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The opportunity to play in a home FIFA Women's World Cup is something every footballer dreams of, and I am looking forward to seeing those dreams come true. Playing for the Matildas in Australia will be the highlight of my career and an opportunity to inspire girls, both in Australia and New Zealand, and all over the world to play football. We have seen great progress in the women's game and Australia-New Zealand will take the game to a whole new level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Participation in football among women and girls across Victoria is growing substantially. The most recent AusPlay data showed the number of females playing club based football—or soccer, for those AFL supporters—in Victoria had more than doubled in five years to 55,000, including 25,000 girls. While the Women's World Cup, supported by measures contained in the bill, will undoubtedly encourage more females to participate, I must also acknowledge the Victorian Labor government's landmark female-friendly change rooms program, which has played a driving role in getting more females involved in local sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tournament will also help to inspire more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young women to play sport, with many First Nations players already having blazed a trail through football. Football Australia estimates that approximately 40,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across the country currently participate in football, with many more set to be inspired by the 2023 World Cup.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Harry Williams was the first Indigenous player in the Socceroos and, in 1974, was also a member of the first Australian team to play at a FIFA World Cup. Since Williams, a host of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander soccer players have made their mark on the game, including A-League and Socceroos star and Olympian Jade North, Matildas goalkeeper Lydia Williams, Kyah Simon, Travis Dodd, James Brown, Jada Whyman and Allira Toby. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I commend this bill to the House and I commend the measures contained in it. I particularly commend the support that this bill will provide to help Australia and New Zealand host a successful 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.</span>

Schedule 1 of the bill provides an income tax exemption for qualifying grants made to primary producers and small businesses affected by Tropical Cyclone Seroja, which had a devastating impact on communities in Western Australia between 11 and 12 April 2021. Affected primary producers and small businesses were eligible to receive recovery grants of up to $25,000, which were activated as a category C measure under the joint Commonwealth-state Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangement 2018. Schedule 1 makes these qualifying grants non-assessable, non-exempt income for tax purposes. These grants provide support in addition to other assistance that the Australian and Western Australian governments have provided to assist communities as they begin to rebuild and recover following this devastating event.</span>

The exemption will apply to income in relation to the event. This event is a major international sporting event and will strengthen our international reputation, promote women's sport and provide opportunities to support Australia's economy. </span>

This includes amendments that clarify the law to ensure it operates in accordance with the policy intent, make minor policy changes to improve administrative outcomes or remedy unintended consequences, and correct technical or drafting defects.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  In regard to Senator McKim's amendments on sheets 1596 and 1597, the opposition won't be supporting these amendments. Specifically, in regard to the amendments on 1596, as I said, the opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendments. The effect of these amendments is to increase red tape on Australian owned companies. By lowering the thresholds, these amendments will equalise the reporting obligations of foreign owned entities and Australian owned entities. The opposition supports reducing red tape and the regulatory burden on Australian companies to support a prosperous and productive economy. For these reasons, as I said, the opposition opposes those amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the amendments on sheet 1597, again, the opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendments. The effect of these amendments is to increase the red tape and compliance burden in the economy. It further removes regulatory certainty for a limited class of companies and constrains the ability of ASIC to make instruments to implement its regulatory decisions. The opposition supports reducing red tape and the regulatory burden on Australian companies to support a prosperous and productive Australian economy. Again, for these reasons, the opposition will oppose the amendments on sheet 1597.</span>

The amendments align with the government's multinational tax transparency election commitments. Transparency is a key factor underpinning the integrity of the tax system. These amendments are a targeted and balanced tax transparency initiative and will provide enhanced public scrutiny on corporate information, which will help to change how corporates view their tax obligations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think the disrespect that the Labor Party has shown by not consulting with the very people that this measure is going to impact is extraordinarily insulting to them. Communities in the trial sites of the Goldfields, the Kimberley, Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and Ceduna actually asked for this particular measure to be put in place. The government are seeking to remove this measure without even bothering to consult with them, and now they want to rush this legislation through this place. I think this is absolutely unbelievable; that this appalling decision does not even go to back to the communities that have asked for it. I would draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that in my home state of South Australia, in Ceduna, the CDC was actually put in place in response to a coronial inquest into the tragic deaths of a number of people on the west coast. It was a recommendation of the coroner's report into those deaths, and it was something that that community asked for.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other sites that previously had the clunky, outdated BasicsCard, the government is now going to deny participants in those communities the ability to access the new technology the cashless debit card offers them. They do not intend to remove income management. In answer to a question asked of him last week, Minister Farrell said that income management was not going to be taken out of the Northern Territory. They want to send those people back to having the clunky old BasicsCard instead of providing them with the advanced technology of the cashless debit card. In doing so, they will also deny the Traditional Credit Union in the Northern Territory the opportunity to support many of their members in using this particular new form of technology.</span>

We do not understand the difference. This is a really important piece of inquiry that I think Australians need to understand. In particular, we need to respect the views and ideas of people in the communities where this card is currently in place. We need to understand what they want and how they want it to be implemented. We need to understand the impact of removing this card without any thought whatsoever, without any consultation. There was no consultation with these communities before the announcement that the card was going to be removed. I think we owe respect to this chamber for review, and we owe respect to those communities to consult with them.</span>

They provided zero consultation to the people of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. I know that because I've been there multiple times. They imposed this from on high through their local member, Mr Pitt. No consultation was taken with that community before this was imposed on them. I went there and did forums in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg. I took the then shadow minister, Linda Burney. We consulted with those people on the ground whom this government ignored. The local member, the member for Hinkler, Mr Pitt, wouldn't even meet with constituents who raised issues about this; that's how arrogant he was. For this opposition to come in here and try to lecture us about consulting is completely outrageous.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something on which we consulted in opposition over many years. The shadow minister travelled to many communities so that we could listen to evidence on the ground. That's what a good opposition does to actually learn the lessons and hear from people directly. We formed our view about this policy over that period of opposition—before we said that we would actually go to the election and say that we would end the cashless debit card. We consulted widely. We were productive in how we used our time in opposition, and we took a policy to the election that the Australian people voted for. So we're not going to get lectured by the opposition about how we do it.</span>

The trauma and the stigma that this has caused people who have been forced onto this card, and the way that they have been treated in these communities, is not acceptable. It's not something that this current government stands for. We absolutely urge the Senate, when the vote comes, to remove the cashless debit card.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I'll just indicate at the start that the Australian Greens would like the questions put separately on the government's amendment, because we intend to vote differently on each. With regard to that, we are happy with the change of reporting date for the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. So we intend to support that amendment to the report, with the amended date of 31 August, as flagged by the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have our own amendment with regard to part (a) of the government's amendment to the report. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Paragraph (a), omit "not be referred to a committee", insert "be referred immediately to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 31 August 2022".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That report has been circulated in my name in the chamber. For the benefit of colleagues in the chamber, this amendment, if it were accepted by the chamber, would refer the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Amendment (Selection and Appointment) Bill 2022 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for an inquiry and report by 31 August 2022. I know that my colleague Senator Shoebridge would like to make a contribution to the debate. I just offer that to senators as perhaps some courtesy in terms of taking up the time of this chamber. I won't be taking my full five minutes, because I would like the chamber to be able to hear from Senator Shoebridge on that matter and also, briefly, Senator Rice on the matter of the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, briefly, the Human Rights Commission legislation amendment bill is really critical legislation. I note that Senator Shoebridge has articulated very well, publicly, the need for an LGBTIQ+ commissioner on the Human Rights Commission. This is a gaping hole in the structures of the commission, and it should be filled. Senator Shoebridge has quite rightly identified an opportunity to make that happen. I think it's really critical that we hear from the LGBTIQ+ community through the mechanism of a Senate inquiry so their concerns can be heard and their deeply held and genuine wishes for an LGBTIQ+ commissioner on the Human Rights Commission can be understood by the government, by the Senate and, ultimately, by the whole parliament. I repeat the Greens' request for these questions to be put separately, and I move my amendment to the minister's amendment.</span>

Just to be clear, so everyone's clear, we have an amendment moved by Senator Gallagher, which is basically in two parts, part (a) and part (b), and Senator McKim has just moved an amendment to part (a), and he wishes for those two to be put separately.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to express my utmost, absolute disappointment at this government's ham-fisted approach to attempt to smash the cashless debit card—income management that, I will remind the government, was an initiative of the Gillard government to begin with. To attempt to now call this racist is utterly ridiculous, because Jenny Macklin as the previous minister defended it and did not call it racist at all but a measure that needed to be put in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk about consulting at the grassroots level! As a Warlpiri women who is engaged with people from remote communities with people who don't speak English as a first language, I find it very distressing, not that this government seems to care at all for these individuals, because they're out of sight and out of mind and they don't have access to media and don't have the ability to articulate, so they can be easily ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of a research group in 2008 when income management began, I was part of investigating and speaking to income management recipients in the first trial of income management—rolled out, again, by the Labor Gillard government. The purpose of the investigation was to seek the views of the recipients on the program. And, I can tell you, speaking directly to Indigenous women, they said that this was very helpful for their lives. I spoke to one woman who stated that she was able to stop drinking and stop gambling and feed her children, and she could say no to family members who were demanding access to her income, as a result. I spoke to a non-Indigenous woman who said she was able to halt her addiction to methamphetamines and, then, to regain custody of her child and ensure that her child could go to school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the people I speak to every single day. I've been fielding calls in my office every day since this was proposed the Labor government from people who are deeply concerned. I had an Indigenous man call me from Western Australia, yesterday, who had grave concerns for his father-in-law who is currently having his income stolen from him by his drug-dealer son. You're all ignoring this! I think it's disgusting. This government is going to ensure that addicts have complete access to and can take away the income and smash the human rights of these vulnerable people in those communities. You have absolutely no idea. Not only this, but you're changing your minds on this particular issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also state that in 2020 Senator Lines—yourself, President—called the BasicsCard racist. Again, it was when your own minister defended it and did not call it racist. Now this government is trying to say that only Territorians will be subject to income management. So it's alright for blackfellas in the Territory but for nobody else in the country! This is creating two classes of people in this nation. We as the coalition decided that it would be for all Australians, equally. Let's not forget, income management and social security is a temporary measure for people to get back on their own two feet. Ultimately, we want people to have jobs so they can stand on their own two feet and use their income as they wish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory it's fifty-fifty. You have 50 per cent cash. So those who are addicts, yes, they can go ahead and buy alcohol, if that's what they want to use it for. They can deny their children a feed. They can do that. The other 50 per cent is quarantined, so maybe they can cover their bills. Indigenous Australians, especially those whose first language is not English, don't have the same sorts of opportunities and freedoms and understanding of a cash economy. They don't have that. They don't have income literacy. This is one of those measures and one of those tools, and I find it absolutely disgusting that you're denying them this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suggest that you get out to some of these remote communities, where people who are out of sight and out of mind to you can't clearly articulate to you because English is not their first language, and stop toeing the ideological line. I will bring to these chambers, over and over again, the messages from those who are continually calling my office, absolutely distressed, about their loved ones whose welfare payments are being stripped from them as we speak. You are leaving them vulnerable and open. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>As I mentioned, some of you argue it's racist. Perhaps this government is racist—because they're suggesting it's alright for blackfellas in the Northern Territory but it's not alright for the rest of Australia. For those that are having a whinge over on Hervey Bay, we're trying to save lives here, not toe the line of ideology. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the amendment moved by my colleague Senator McKim to refer the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Amendment (Selection and Appointment) Bill 2022 to committee for inquiry over the short recess between the end of this sitting week and when we return. It looks very much like a stitch-up has happened between the opposition and the Labor government to prevent stakeholders having the ability to engage with an inquiry over the next fortnight to improve the government's bill. Let's be clear: the government's bill does little more than suggest there needs to be a newspaper advertisement when there's a new appointment proposed for the Australian Human Rights Commission. You don't need legislation, last time I checked, to put an ad in the paper, but it is useful. We don't oppose the bill; indeed, we support the bill. It's useful to have an ad in the paper, at least! We know that the previous government did; they just appointed their mates quietly without any due process. So, yes, we support legislation that requires an ad to go into the paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government has said in moving this legislation that it's implementing the Paris principles. That is so far from the truth that it is close to embarrassing. Australia's human rights commission is at risk of being downgraded from class A to class B, going below the human rights framework of Iraq. That is because of the action of the previous government but also because of the structural inadequacies in our human rights framework. The Greens are proposing to respond to that criticism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The criticism that came from the subcommittee included—I will read the list. The Australian Human Rights Commission does not have explicit requirements to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are multiple criticisms the UN has made about the way in which appointments happen and the nature of appointments to the Australian Human Rights Commission. And all this government does in response is say, 'We're going to have a newspaper ad, going forward.' We've heard from a series of stakeholders that they want this legislation to go further. They want to implement the Paris principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key lacks in our human rights framework is the absence of a commissioner representing the LGBTIQA+ community. We can't understand why the government is resisting the amendment we circulated to lift the protections for the LGBTIQA+ community and give them what they deserve: someone in their corner, a commissioner who can respond to what have been some quite hateful attacks—some of them driven by the previous government. Those hateful attacks won't necessarily end. The Greens, on behalf of that community, want to see a human rights commissioner who's in their corner, who can hear their concerns, who can respond to their concerns and who can give this government and this parliament direction in how to improve the law and ensure their status is fully protected in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It looks like one of the first actions the Labor government, with the coalition, will take on human rights is to do a stitch-up and prevent an inquiry from even asking the question and from hearing from stakeholders about the need for that commissioner. That's a pretty poor act from the government in one of its first actions on human rights. We'd ask the government to reconsider voting with the opposition on this and opposing an inquiry, opposing letting stakeholders have their views heard about the establishment of an LGBTIQA+ commissioner, and reconsider, as one of the first actions they'll take in this parliament on human rights, voting with the coalition, given their appalling track record. That's likely what's going to happen here. That's a tragedy for the community, but it's also a really poor indicator for where this government is intending to go over the next three years. I'd urge the Labor government to look closely at Senator McKim's amendment. Don't vote with that mob and shut down the discussion as your first step on human rights.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Au</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">stralia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  On the matter that is before the Senate, which is the time that we will have to scrutinise and allow public input into the legislation regarding the abolition of the cashless debit card, I think it is absolutely appalling that proper time is not being given to allow the community and, in particular, the communities that are involved in the cashless debit card to give input into this decision that we all need to make in this place. It is an absolute travesty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw, through the election campaign, many comments from those opposite and from around the country, calling for greater levels of transparency and accountability. Here is the first opportunity for that to be enacted and on display. Yet, sadly, what we're seeing from this government is a ramming-through of this legislation. Granted, they took this decision to the election. The Australian people, of course, did make their decision. But let's look at the particular communities where the cashless debit card is in operation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the member for O'Connor, Mr Wilson, was very much out there with his support of the cashless debit card. He was re-elected. You look at the member for Grey. He's also someone who's very supportive of the cashless debit card, and Ceduna, in the western part of South Australia, is one of the cashless debit card areas. He was re-elected. You look at the north-west of Western Australia, right up the very top in the East Kimberley, part of the seat of Durack, where Ms Price is the member. She is also someone who is very much on the record in support of the cashless debit card. She was re-elected. So it's really important that we actually hear from these communities where the cashless debit card is in operation. </span>

                    </a>  Senator O'Sullivan, you started off really well, talking about the amendments. I've given you fair time; you've strayed a bit—if you'd come back to the amendments. </span>

                    </a>  Thank you for bringing me back, Madam President. This is about the amount of time that these communities will have to consider this bill. These are busy people. To just rush this bill through and not allow for proper consideration of this bill is disrespectful to those people, particularly the people that this bill is going to impact the most. We hear a lot about consultation; we hear a lot about the need for it. Well, I know that, since the election—unless something has changed in the last five days since I spoke to people up in the northern Goldfields—no-one from the government, Senator Chisholm, has been in the Goldfields to discuss the cashless debit card and its abolition. Now, this is a real shame. They should be given the full opportunity to put in thorough submissions that will detail very clearly, very accurately, what their views are on the abolition of the cashless debit card.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There does seem to be a very ideologically driven approach to this from the government. We know that members of the government, when they were in opposition, called this policy racist. They called this policy racist. So there is an ideologically driven approach to this policy, rather than a focus on what is necessary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill significantly protects our oceans and takes effective climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's destiny is encircled by our seas, figuratively and literally. Most of our population live on or near our coastlines. Australians love our beaches, we love our oceans, they are such an important part of our culture. Our oceans also feed us, and dictate our weather, our fortunes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As our oceans warm from rising fossil fuel emissions, the rapid changes we are seeing right before our eyes are frightening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Great Barrier Reef has lost half its coral cover in the past ten years, due to unprecedented marine heatwaves linked directly to rising emissions; this is something many of us didn't believe we could see in our lifetimes. Since 2016, the Great Barrier Reef has suffered four mass bleaching events. The most recent, just this year in March, took place during a La Nina weather event, a weather pattern that should bring cooler weather. Without radical climate action extreme weather events are expected to get much worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The loss of my home state lutruwita/Tasmania's millions year old giant kelp forest habitat, so critical to the billion-dollar abalone and rock lobster fisheries, is another brutal consequence of exploring and burning fossil fuels in a time of climate emergency. We are in an existential crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is why the International Energy Agency told us 2021 must be the year we end all new fossil fuel exploration. This is why the UN Secretary-General said following the release of the latest IPCC report we are "on the edge of an irreversible disaster" and are facing a "code red for humanity". It is insanity to be risking our beaches and marine life by opening up new areas of our oceans, to explore for the exact same dirty fossil fuel product that is cooking and killing them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This was seemingly recognised by our previous Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his LNP government, when they recently stopped and banned oil and gas drilling in an area of ocean designated Petroleum Exploration Permit 11—PEP11—representing 4500km[2] of ocean and coastline, from Manly through to Newcastle. Communities and campaigners were gratified to hear then Prime Minister Morrison and numerous LNP election candidates declare that they would not be supporting offshore petroleum exploration in PEP 11 because they were "protecting local communities and the environment", their beaches were "too important to be put at any risk" and that the LNP would "safe guard this natural asset for future generations".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This sentiment was shared by the comments of the now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who said "PEP 11 doesn't make sense from an economic, environmental, or energy perspective."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens wholeheartedly agree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, there is nothing to stop the area of PEP 11 from being exploited in the future. Any proposed exploration would threaten critically important whale migration routes and dolphin habitats. This bill presents an opportunity for both Liberal and Labor parties to demonstrate their commitment and make good on their promises. PEP 11 is dead, and this legislation is a chance to, if I may quote Prime Minister Albanese once again, consign this or future projects to the dustbin of history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, 31,000km2 of pristine ocean in the Otway Basin is also under threat. While I am gratified to see that no applications were made in the recent round of acreage releases, the Basin is not protected from future attempts. With potential sites just a handful of kilometres from the Great Ocean Road, one of the most famous landmarks in Australia—the 12 Apostles—could become synonymous with rigs and discharge flames. Just like off the coast of NSW, this project poses an unacceptable risk and is not compatible with community expectations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And in my state of lutruwita/Tasmania, the oceans and fisheries off King Island are now at risk, as these precious waters are exposed to seismic testing and drilling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This reckless disregard for the sanctity and health of our oceans has to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If it was good enough for the Labor and Liberal Party to oppose and stop drilling for oil and gas off the coast of NSW, why not in the Otway Basin or off the coast of beautiful King Island? If our Prime Minister "got it" when he publicly recognised the risks of offshore fossil fuel exploration, he should apply this standard to other parts of our magnificent country and coastline. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just last year, I led Australia's first parliamentary inquiry into the environmental and social impacts on our oceans and marine life of seismic surveys from oil and gas exploration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It took three attempts to get the inquiry established, with evidence provided to the committee that government ministers were keen to avoid the scrutiny of a Senate inquiry, quietly getting concerned fishing stakeholders together with the fossil fuel industry, to hammer out an alternative to an inquiry and resolve differences behind closed doors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence also demonstrated that this secretive process failed to provide comfort for commercial fishing stakeholders who, after years of dealing with the oil and gas industry or their lackeys in government, had reason not to trust them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time ever, the Senate heard evidence from all stakeholders, from both the fishing and the oil and gas industries to environmental NGOs, governments, scientists, academics, and community groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee heard an abundance of evidence detailing the risks to our oceans and fisheries from ongoing oil and gas exploration. No witness disputed that seismic testing is potentially harmful and under-researched. What was disputed was whether this risk was 'acceptable', with the oil and gas industry and the regulator NOPSEMA saying this meant avoiding "permanent or irreversible harm". Harm is OK, as long as it wasn't permanent or irreversible! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But seriously, who would know, given the almost complete lack of historical research into long term, cumulative seismic testing impacts on fisheries? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I find it hard to comprehend that a trillion-dollar industry that has been conducting seismic testing for decades has hardly spent a cent on better understanding the impacts of their activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee heard evidence that the current regulatory framework does not provide financing for research, monitoring, or sufficient environmental or economic protections from the impacts of seismic surveying and gives too much latitude to a regulator who is perceived to be too close to the petroleum industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are other voices though, not quiet but loud and clear. They are the voices of our coastal communities, and they have boldly said what their expectation of 'acceptable' really is. No harm is acceptable, too much uncertainty exists. We should proceed with caution. The principle that states that a lack of full scientific certainty should be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet, where the government is concerned, in the absence of research, the onus seems to be placed on those who have concerns to prove damage, rather than the proponents or regulator having to prove it does no damage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are all here, in this place, as Senators because of a commitment to listen to all voices, and not just become enablers for private vested interests who donate to big political parties for their own benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fossil fuel companies can draw off extensive resources, utilising millions of dollars to pursue dangerous and destructive offshore drilling and seismic testing. Local communities, forced to fight for their future when those in power will not, have nothing like the kind of money at the disposal of these big corporations. But they have the Greens in parliament. We will stand with them every time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we see around the nation today is a David and Goliath stand-off, with a handful of multinational oil and gas industry giants on one side, and multi-generational local fishing communities and ocean lovers on the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence abounds that the Australian community expects the precautionary principle to be applied in favour of the environment, not in favour of exploration and commercial interests, and be applied to any reasonable threat of environmental damage, not just a threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has acknowledged that new research is important to understanding the broader impacts of seismic testing on marine ecosystems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Particularly after recent research publications continues to highlight risks from seismic testing to commercial fishing species. Research undertaken by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies has raised significant questions about the impact of seismic testing on Southern Rock Lobsters. Research completed in 2020, partly funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, found that seismic surveying reduced whiting catch rate in the Gippsland Basin by 99.5%. So serious was the situation that the oil and gas surveying company was ordered by NOPSEMA to pay out fishers in Lakes Entrance. The evidence is building. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, a newly elected government gets to decide if they will continue to hand out permits for offshore oil and gas exploration, backed with taxpayer subsidies, right around the country while being fully aware of this uncertainty, and while doing nothing to address this.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are not prepared to play games with the future of Australia's coastline communities. The time has come for strong and meaningful action. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I urge all Senators to support this necessary bill to ban new offshore oil and gas exploration, I urge them to speak to marine biologists, climate scientists, coastal communities; their first nations elders, their fishers, those who care for the sea, they will tell you their way of life is under threat, and that their local economy relies on a thriving ocean, now increasingly broken by the burning of fossil fuels. </span>

                    </a>  I'm proud to put my name forward to be a member of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia. I have a deep abiding commitment to Northern Australia, its people, its places and cultures. The Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia requires members with a deep knowledge, understanding and respect for the region. As a regionally based senator who has spent the majority of my life living and working in northern Queensland, I bring these qualities to the role. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken extensively about my time spent as a teacher in northern Australia, but my experience doesn't only come from decades of living and teaching in the north. I also have significant commercial law experience working in trade and transport, with a focus on marine industries, which are critical for many communities across the north. I also hold the portfolio of northern Australia for the Greens, alongside the portfolios of industry, transition and regional development. I'm well placed to make a meaningful contribution to the important work of this committee. </span>

We need to be centring rights, justice, truth-telling and treaty, as well as a voice to parliament, at the heart of everything we do and to be viewing, through a lens of First Nations justice, all of our considerations in this place. We need to remember at all times that we are working on stolen land. This is stolen land. Here in this place, we are on Ngunnawal, Ngambri and Wiradjuri country, and sovereignty has never been ceded. This always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I speak today, the debate on the government's climate bill is almost completed, I understand, in the House. There is about to be a vote on the bill, which will set a target of 43 per cent reduction in our carbon emissions by 2030. We, as Greens, know that this is so far from what is necessary, but we, as Greens, also know that it is a step forward. It is a massive step forward from the climate denialism of the previous government. Their target was clearly completely out of step with the rest of the world and completely out of step with what the science requires. But we also know that the 43 per cent target is basically going to be baking in the most extreme climate change and the most extreme heat, with global heating double what we've got now. It is just not enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As people know, the Greens announced yesterday that we would be supporting the government's climate bill because it is a step forward. But, as Adam Bandt, our leader, said, 'It's like bringing a bucket of water to a house fire.' It's a step forward, but it's nowhere near enough. We need to be doing so much more if we are going to have a safe climate for us, for the people of the future and for all the other species that we share this planet with. We know what the science says. It's not just the Greens saying this. Scientists, the International Energy Agency, certainly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and countries all around the world know that we need to have at least a 75 per cent reduction in our carbon pollution by 2030. Even that is going to bake in 1½ degrees of warming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen what less than 1½ degrees of warming means in terms of the weather that is being experienced around the world now. We have seen it in our Black Summer bushfires—those extraordinary fires that killed billions and billions of animals, that caused deaths around the country from heat stress and caused massive impacts on our natural environment. We saw the huge fires and the burning of our native forests. In the East Gippsland region of Victoria, 80 per cent of the forest burned in those fires. We've seen the heatwaves in Europe. We've seen the temperature in England reach 40 degrees. We have seen the hundreds, if not thousands, of people dying there. We've seen the heatwaves across Pakistan and India. We've seen the floods here in Australia. This is what's going to continue. This is what we need to tackle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what's causing this. We have known it for decades. Certainly I came into this place with a history of having worked on climate. I knew that the No. 1 existential issue that we needed to take serious action on was to reduce our carbon pollution to zero as quickly as possible and, in fact, to achieve negative emissions. That means getting out of coal, gas and oil, because it is the burning of those fossil fuels which is causing the climate crisis. So our position, of course, is that we are going to keep on talking about the need to lift our level of ambition and get out of the burning of coal, gas and oil as quickly as we possibly can here in Australia. We also need to stop contributing to the world's burning of coal and gas and oil by continuing to open up new mines and new coal and gas. We cannot afford to do so. We just can't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems with decision-making in this place is that there is such a short-term approach, one that thinks about what's going to happen in terms of profits for a very small number of people over a very small period of time, when that's not the decision-making framework that we need to have. We need to be thinking about the reality of what the burning of those coal and gas reserves is going to mean for our future. And it's not a happy future. The science is really clear. Every tonne of coal and gas burnt increases the intensity and the speed of changes to our climate, which means more floods such as those experienced across New South Wales and Queensland this year, more intense droughts, more heatwaves and more frequent bushfires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The positive thing about a government agenda and what we can be working on together is that Australia is so blessed with renewable resources, both for ourselves as a country and for export to the rest of the world. We are probably the best placed in the whole world to be leading this transition, and that's what we need to be doing. We need to be working towards that, rather than, hypocritically, using the drug dealer's defence about our coal and our gas—if we don't burn it, if we don't mine it, if we don't export it, then somebody else will. Not only is that immoral, completely unsubstantiated and completely unacceptable in relation to what the impact of it would be for our future, it's just not true. We are the world's second-largest exporter of thermal coal. Australia is the third-largest fossil fuel exporter behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. In fact, if we had a planned transition out of coal and gas—we've got our coal and gas mines at the moment—if we had a planned transition out of those and we absolutely did not open up any of the 114 new coal and gas mines that are being planned, if we did that in a planned and measured way, it would have a massive impact on the world's supply and it would turbocharge the shift which is already happening around the world to renewable energy, including so much Australian renewable energy. Australian electricity, Australian hydrogen, created with Australian jobs in the future focused Australian economy—that's the direction that we need to be putting all of our efforts into. We need to be saying, 'This is the sustainable future for us all. This is what's going to be bringing wealth and wellbeing to Australia as well as to the rest of the world.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens implore the government to listen to the science and to lift its ambition. We will keep on talking about the need to get out of coal and gas. The Climate Change Bill 2022, which is going through the House today and which will come back to us in the Senate in the coming months, is just the first step. There is so much more that needs to be done. We implore the government to listen to the voices of the community, rather than to the voices of the big coal and gas corporations, and to listen particularly to the voices of young people, who, unlike most of us—I don't know whether I'll still be around in 2050: certainly, in 2070 I'll be long gone. The young people, who are talking about their future, are going to be here in 2050. They're going to be here in 2070. They are the people who will have to live with the consequences of our decision today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our opening day, on Tuesday of last week, when the Governor-General gave his speech, we had young people here in this parliament. They came to parliament to have their voices heard on these urgent issues of climate and inequality. However, very sadly, in an attempt to silence them, these young, peaceful protesters were ejected by the parliament, by police, for singing—for singing, mind you!—in peaceful protest. I'm so glad that the following day I was able to get out and meet them and to sing with them on the lawns of Parliament House, to tell them that we heard their voices, that we listened to them and that we were going to keep on acting, being their representatives in this place and trying to get the government to listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will use some of my time here today to elevate their voices and to give you the words that they were telling us—their message to us all on Tuesday last week. They are a strong and growing movement of young people from all over the country, and they want you to hear this. They told us that, with people across the country facing unprecedented climate disasters, rising costs of living and a housing crisis, we need climate jobs for all, and that solving the climate crisis is too important to be left in the hands of big business. We need sustained action, coordinated by the government, in the hands of the public. They said that a climate jobs guarantee will end unemployment and get our economy back on track. It will solve the climate crisis. It will prepare us for climate disasters. And they said that our politicians have a choice to make: they can either bend to the will of big business or choose a people-first recovery that makes society better than what it was before the pandemic. So I pledged to those young people from the Tomorrow Movement that we Greens are listening, and I implore everybody else in this place to listen to them as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things that was really notable in the Governor-General's speech was the absence of any commitment to protect our native forests. Protecting our forests is one of the most efficient, effective and immediate ways to take climate action, because our native forests are excellent carbon sinks. There was a recent study on Tasmania's forests by the Tree Projects, which revealed that protecting native forests could provide $2.6 billion worth of carbon sequestration by 2050. Alarmingly, the study also found that annual emissions from native forest logging in Tasmania are equivalent to the annual emissions of 1.1 million cars. Experts have also warned us that logging our precious native forests increases the frequency and severity of bushfires, driving threatened species further into extinction and placing Australians in danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, we are not protecting our forests. We must protect our forests, or we risk a climate catastrophe, and yet native forest logging is being facilitated by state and federal governments, who are recklessly destroying our forests. Native forest logging will never be sustainable. It destroys First Nations' country and totem species. It destroys habitat and robs our future generations of the right to our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, again, as I'm speaking here today, this afternoon, in the Victorian parliament, there is legislation being passed that is going to mean that the people protesting about this and defending our forests could be imprisoned for up to a year or receive up to $21,000 in fines. Similar antiprotest laws have also been debated in the Tasmanian and New South Wales parliaments. So I'm calling upon this government to speak out about these state government laws. We need to scrap our logging laws. We need to protect our native forests. But, at the very least, what this Labor government could do is to speak up for people's rights and speak up for the environment. They should be making the strongest representations to Victoria to abandon these laws, which are an attack on people's rights as well as an attack on our forests.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I also rise to make a contribution in response to the address by the Governor-General at the commencement of the 47th Parliament. To hear the bold nation-changing agenda of the Albanese Labor government reflected in his words was a really proud moment for me in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as a government, have so much work to do. We took a plan to the election that will deliver considered and serious reform across Australia. Our plans for early education and care will ensure that 97 per cent of Australian families have better, cheaper access to care. We are committed to the development and implementation of an early-years strategy, to identify how best government can coordinate the various government services impacting the early years. This is about delivering real outcomes, better outcomes, for our youngest Australians—something I am deeply passionate about. We have promised to rebalance the industrial framework of Australia to provide more job security and stronger wage growth, and to close the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a proud and parochial South Australian, I have seen at close hand the impact of declining manufacturing in this country. It has affected my state perhaps more than any other. At times, during the previous government, we've seen that decline in manufacturing be aided and abetted by the decisions that they have made. The collapse of our car industry in South Australia has consequences that will be felt in South Australia for generations to come. But it's not just the car industry. It was the uncertainty given to the workers at Osborne in the submarine program, who were left uncertain, year after year, Christmas after Christmas, about the future of their jobs, about the opportunities for them in our state. Australia should be a country that makes things—great things—and our government will make it one again. Australians also deserve to have faith that, when they go to work, they get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. This is a pillar of fairness in Australia. It's part of who we are as Australians. It's something else that we will deliver. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another pillar of fairness is Medicare, which, after a decade of coalition government, has been run down in the face of growing demand. This pandemic that we've all been living through in the past few years has been a stark reminder of the importance of a well-funded and robust public health system, which only Labor prioritises and only Labor delivers in government. I'm proud of our commitments, during this election, that will strengthen Medicare further. We built Medicare, we believe in it and we will protect it. We will make it easier to see a doctor and cut the costs of medications for millions of Australians. We have reforms to children's health care, including ending the newborn health screening lottery and providing better care for children with hearing loss. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The task of Labor governments is always urgent. Once again, we've entered government at a hugely challenging time for our nation. I am absolutely committed to meeting the moment in which we find ourselves, as a government and as a community, and I know every member of the Albanese Labor government is as well. We don't intend to waste a single day of government in facing and tackling the challenges facing the Australian people and our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was elected in 2019. Since then, I've travelled all over our state, talking to families, talking to workers, talking to kids, about what they wanted out of their government and what our plan was for South Australians. From Ceduna to Murray Bridge, Gawler to Payneham, the message was clear: South Australians wanted better. They wanted more from their government and they wanted something fairer. And, particularly over the last couple of years, they've wanted change. They felt unheard, unlistened to, and they felt that the previous government didn't have their interests at heart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care workers have told me about the desperate conditions they've faced every day at work, feeling underpaid and overworked and not being given the respect that they deserve. I will never forget the incredible privilege I had to join a group of aged-care workers in Adelaide as they bussed from their workplaces to the CBD, to protest against the government's failures on aged care. I was invited by my good friend Donna, a proud and fearless advocate for the hardworking and dedicated aged-care workers she works alongside every day, and, of course, the residents they adore, too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we bussed into the city and got closer to town, some of these workers started playing music on the bus. One of the songs they put on was by Sir Elton John—I'm not going to sing it, but the words are, 'I'm still standing after all this time.' It was a light moment on a serious day, but I couldn't get those words out of my mind. What apt words to describe a workforce that had been pushed to breaking point not just during the pandemic but also in the years before it, where aged care was treated with nothing short of neglect. For these workers, for the residents they care for, for the families who love those residents, we finally, under this government, have a chance to do better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from countless families and caregivers, disheartened by their inability to access affordable, quality early learning and care in the communities where they live—families weighing up the financial implications of another day of care, making huge decisions about their lives, their work and their children because costs of care are crushing. But it's not just families; it's our early-learning educators, left completely behind during the pandemic. They felt unseen and unvalued by the government, a government—in what I think was one of the lowest days we've had in this building—where we had reports of its members labelling child care as 'outsourced parenting'. It was one of the most vile attacks our early-learning educators had experienced and, of course, it was deeply offensive to the families who rely on them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been really proud to stand up for our educators. We have a big agenda for early learning, but I am keenly aware that it's not everything. My ambition for early learning knows absolutely no bounds, and it's something I will continue to fight and advocate for in the years ahead, because it matters. It matters to children in care—to their opportunities and outcomes; it matters to productivity; it matters to the kind of nation that we want to build; it matters when we're looking at smashing intergenerational disadvantage; and it matters for the amazing workforce which delivers this profound service to our community in educating our littlest minds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the pandemic caused such great devastation in South Australia we had another kind of devastation with the summer bushfires which struck Kangaroo Island and the Adelaide Hills. Homes and businesses were destroyed and lives were lost. These sorts of disasters are devastating and they're only going to get worse; they're set to get even more severe and more frequent because of the effects of climate change. My community in South Australia knows that; South Australians want action on climate change. They're sick and tired of the climate wars. They voted for us because they want these wars to be over. I am so proud that in the other place we've seen that work start today. And we have more to do: we're going to end these climate wars, we're going to get the action that we need and we're going to do it in a way which brings business, which brings workers and which brings environmental groups together on a journey to meet our responsibilities and do what we know we need to do for our planet and our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also heard from young South Australians, over the past few years and still now, about the difficulties they face with housing—either buying their first homes or dealing with ever-increasing rents. That's gotten much worse in South Australia since 2020, with prices skyrocketing and rental availability going down. On top of these challenges, they had a government forcing them to drain their superannuation accounts—to tap into that limited resource when they were doing it tough. I've heard from small and medium businesses who rely on the pathway of defence manufacturing in South Australia and who are fearful for their futures with the continual delays to decisions around the future of work at Osborne. These are businesses which now have a new assurance from our defence minister, who is committed to manufacturing the nuclear submarine fleet in Adelaide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of these stories paints a picture of an Australia tired of nine long years of a government with no agenda, no plans and no desire to build a better future for Australia. These people represent just a fraction of the community I represent—a community I talk to and seek to represent, help and assist in my work as a senator. It's one of the best parts of what I get to do: getting into different communities in our state, talking to people, finding out what's going on on the ground and then bringing that back into this place and fighting for change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one community in particular in South Australia which has absolutely captured my heart through my time as a senator, and that's the community of Ceduna and the surrounding areas. I was shocked to learn about this community's pleas for help in replacing their local health clinic, which was dangerously run down and had been ignored for years by governments who kept passing the buck. This clinic of course is Yadu health, a clinic I've spoken about many times in this chamber. It's a clinic riddled with mould, asbestos and water damage. It's where a staff member said they had been electrocuted at their desk when trying to plug something into the wall. Another staff member talked about the roof falling in during the rains. It's a clinic where too many people walk in, say, 'Oh, that's terrible!' and just keep on walking. This clinic will now be rebuilt by the Albanese Labor government. I am so proud of this commitment, and I'm deeply grateful to the Hon. Linda Burney MP and to Minister Kyam Maher in SA for their work here as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the election, the most common sentiment I've heard from South Australians in talking about the result is relief, and it's a feeling that I felt on election night too—relief that something better, fairer and more just is on its way to Australia. It was relief that leadership and accountability is back; relief that our nation's diversity would finally be better reflected in the new parliament—indeed, it's better reflected in this chamber; and relief that progressive values that prioritise caring for one another, looking after one another and valuing people could once again be at the heart of federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many people contributed to the outcome: volunteers and, of course, all the candidates who ran. I want to acknowledge in the other place my good friends Matt Burnell and Louise Miller-Frost, who were elected at this election, and also the many candidates who put their hands up for Labor values, like Sonja in Sturt, Julie in Grey, Mark in Barker, Marisa in Mayo and Trimann, Jo and Belinda, who were all candidates for Labor's Senate ticket. All these candidates committed to our values and were committed to what we were trying to achieve, to get an agenda of fairness back at the heart of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate Tony Zappia MP and Steve Georganas MP in the other place on their re-election, and I note that I'm very proud to continue to serve alongside Senator Grogan, even though, like me, she was not up for re-election this time. I also want to acknowledge that in the ministry we have some great South Australians in Senator Wong, Senator Farrell, Amanda Rishworth and Mark Butler, all of whom I congratulate on their appointments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place in 2019, I outlined my belief that one of the greatest tasks for Labor is to make Australia better for the generations to come. We are custodians of the institutions and the levers of policy within government to make it better, to make it fairer—and we're on our way. I was proud to sit in this place during the Governor-General's address last week, where the values and goals and bold ideas of our new Labor government were read into the record. It is an incredibly humbling honour to be part of the Albanese Labor government, which I know will place fairness, boldness, urgency and unity at the centre of our plans to tackle the challenges before our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our party, the great Australian Labor Party, is the great reformer of Australian history. Whether it's the establishment of Medicare under Bob Hawke, native title or the NDIS, we do the big things, the hard things, that change our nation fundamentally for the better. I know the reforms of our government, led by Anthony Albanese, will lead to a fairer and better Australia for the next generation and those to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am especially humbled by the task ahead, with the referendum on a voice and, indeed, the broader implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, which Labor is committed to delivering—voice, treaty and truth. In Garma, we saw the Prime Minister set the road map for the path ahead. This is the start of the public discussion. This is the start of the process, which I hope will lead to a voice. If we get there, I know that that voice will make a practical difference. I believe South Australians are ready for voice, treaty and truth. They want to walk in unity towards that path. As a senator, I'll take my leadership responsibility to walk with Australians towards that goal and do that in a way that is collaborative and respectful. Ultimately, I hope that is something that this parliament, the 47th Parliament, can achieve and be proud of achieving together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks in response to the Governor-General's statement at the opening of the parliament last week and to deal with one of the primary issues in the speech where the government identified the Uluru Statement as a priority. It is an important issue, and it is going to take a lot of thought and care for us to be able to deliver on some of the components of those policies that have been sought under that statement. The first point is that there is no question that, over the past 250 years, we have failed to institute good policies in Indigenous affairs. We have not been able to provide the sort of country we want to be. All you need to do is look at the often-recited statistics in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> reports, which are regularly provided, and the updates given by the Productivity Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reflecting upon what Senator Smith had to say, there is no question that the Labor Party have done some good things over their history in Indigenous affairs, and so has the Liberal Party. It will take a degree of bipartisanship and tripartisanship if we are going to have any success in this area. We are living in a country that has not had a successful referendum since 1977, which was quite a long time before I was born, and there have been a series of defeated referenda in my lifetime. In order to achieve broad based support for a change in the Constitution, it will be very important to take people along on the journey and to address issues, some of which have been raised in this chamber and in this building in the past couple of weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a reasonable proposition that we would seek to achieve what John Howard set out in 2007, when he said that we should have a form of constitutional recognition, but that we also should seek to do a better job on listening to people in communities about government service delivery and do a better job of ensuring that the laws and policies we make for Indigenous people are working for those communities. It is true that everyone is an individual, and it is also true that, when you travel around parts of regional Australia and talk to community members, as I have in western New South Wales, they are not talking about the Constitution. They're not thinking about constitutional amendments, in many cases. The issues that are before them are much more immediate and are often about routine service delivery—getting kids to school and the like. My view is that these changes, if done properly, can address this wretched problem of: How does government provide services? How does government engage with and listen to citizens, particularly in the far-flung parts of the states that we represent? My hope is that that is what can happen in this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, with a set of words having been put on the table last weekend—and as our shadow minister, Mr Leeser, indicated is a reasonable question and reasonable starting point—the parliament and the community should be given an opportunity to look at the various models or forms of words that could not only be applicable and acceptable to Indigenous people more broadly but also have a chance of being adopted and have a chance of winning at a referendum. I think that is a reasonable position for us to work on. I will be happy to work with other people in this parliament on that process. I would make the point, though, that if we are going to focus on the voice, which I understand is the first priority that most people in this place have indicated we should pursue, that is going to take a lot of the effort. I think it's going to be hard to pursue other significant measures in this space. So I look forward to making some contributions there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the main reason we have this parliament is to ensure that we can put in place policies for the benefit of our people. My view has always been that the foundation of a fair or good society is a strong economy. The Labor Party had a few policies they took to the election that they won—not many; they had a few. They had a few policies for the economy—just a few. Let's see how they go with those. But, in the first few weeks of the government's time in office, the initial agenda appears to be very focused on paying off vested interests: the super funds, the unions and the class action lawyers. I just say that, if the job of a government is to work through the list of grievances from its vested interests, that would be a very regrettable start. I think we will ultimately end up in a position where the government is going to run out of things to do, because these laundry lists of rent-seekers are only so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll step through a few of these misguided agenda items. Everyone knows that the ABCC abolition is purely designed to pay off the CFMMEU, which is the major donor to the Labor Party. Why would anyone want to reduce the rule of law and transparency in that key construction sector? Then we've got Mr Jones over in the House of Representatives seeking to hide political donations that have been made by the super funds into the union movement. What's very curious is that Mr Jones is also seeking to hide payments from the super funds to the union movement. He is seeking to do that by ripping up regulations that were made only a few months ago which require super funds to disclose to members in their annual member statements the amount and the detail of the payments that are made to political parties and to unions. They're required to be disclosed in detail. Mr Jones wants to rip that up. He's wanting to do that before the disclosures have even been made for the financial year just gone, I assume because he doesn't want to be embarrassed by what disclosures are going to be made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He currently has a consultation draft of his regulation with the Treasury department. I feel sorry for the Treasury officials. I feel sorry for them having to implement this absolute garbage, which is basically going to rip up the transparency and integrity provisions that have been put in place. After the Labor Party have lectured everyone else in this place about transparency and integrity, one of their first items is, of course, to reduce integrity and transparency. Anyway, Mr Jones is out there consulting on his regulations to hide these donations and these payments. 'The great super cover-up' is what I call it. If he decides to go ahead with this and he wants to make this regulation, of course this chamber could disallow that regulation within 15 days of it having been made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's see. We will see whether the people who talk endlessly about integrity and transparency are going to eat their words or whether they are going to ensure that people who are forced to save into these vehicles are allowed to see where their money is going. That is the question: can people who are members of super funds see where their money is going? Is it going to the Labor Party? Is it going off to the unions? We know that in the last year 13 million bucks went from the super funds into the unions. That's going to balloon to $30 million by the end of this decade, so it's a lot of money. Anyone who's been involved in political campaigns in Australia can tell you that 13 million bucks a year is a lot of money. We will see if Mr Jones wants to pursue this regulation. I suspect that he may not want to, but if he does we will test the mettle of the Senate and see whether people are really committed to transparency and integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that Mr Jones is pursuing over there in the House is a proposal to weaken the best financial interests duty that was put in place for the super funds, which is designed to stop the super funds giving the money out for non-commercial, non-member-focused activities. It is designed to stop these sorts of payments to unions and to political parties. It is designed to ensure that the funds can't get engaged in political advertising. It's designed to stop the funds sending money off to their boondoggle, the New Daily, which is an organisation that they've funded heavily and is basically just a propaganda outfit. The whole point of the best financial interests duty was to ensure that superannuation is there for the members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Jones has asked the Treasury—again, I feel sorry for the Treasury officials, who are very good officials. The Treasury officials in the Markets Group are some of the best public servants in the Commonwealth, and they're sitting there having to review the best financial interests duty. The only reason you would want to review the best financial interests duty is that you want to permit new payments that are banned today. That's the only reason you would do it. So we will see. Mr Jones, at some stage, will have to come clean on what other payments he wants to see. Does he want to open the floodgates to more payments for unions? Does he want to set up a new media empire funded by the unions? Maybe he wants to send more money through to the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. We will find out. But until we are clearer about what payments he wants to admit, that agenda can only be seen as working through a laundry list of items for the super fund and union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Labor Party have put forward very few policies for small business, and I think that in this term of parliament we should be looking to make it easier for people to run a small business, make it easier to hire, make it easier to comply with government regulations and make it easier to pay tax. We want to make sure that small businesses in this country are very easy to get going. Equally, my own party should have a good hard look at what policies we're prepared to put on the table as a party of government and, directionally, my party should also take time to consider the verdict that was given at the last election. I believe we should be very focused on our core equities of putting forward policies that are predominantly around driving economic growth, looking after enterprise and ensuring that we are focused on fairness—looking after people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that in the last period there have been too many cases where we have been dragged into culture wars and things that didn't really matter to people, or people couldn't understand why we were pursuing them, and we have been perceived at times as not being focused on fairness. We need to be a party of government focused on fairness and enterprise and we need to consider carefully the feedback from the electorate that we received in May. There is always room for improvement. People shouldn't be defensive about these things. It is my strong view that we have to have much better policies on emissions reduction. We have to take seriously the issues that were raised by Australian women, and we have to be committed to working with the government and other parties to put in place a serious integrity commission in Canberra. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this week has been an important week on that journey and I very much welcome the opposition leader's commitment that the Liberal Party and the coalition will develop a stronger policy on emissions reduction. We have had the 26 to 28 per cent reduction by 2030 for too long, and it has not been good enough. I am very keen that we go to the next election—well before the next election—with a vastly stronger policy on emissions reduction. It's important that the parties of government are presenting to the community but also to investors, who we want to fund this transition—we don't want taxpayers to be funding the transition; we want the market to fund it—that the parties of government are committed to emissions reduction, are committed to doing it in a competitive way, are going to keep pace with our competitors and are going to do our fair share of the heavy lifting. Thank you for the opportunity to speak; goodbye. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  On 21 May this year Australians voted for change. They voted for change because they were tired. They were tired of an almost decade-old government that failed to address the major issues our country was facing. They were tired of a Prime Minister who refused to take responsibility, who would respond to questions about his failure to act with, 'That's not my job' or 'I don't hold a hose, mate'. They were tired of the Prime Minister's failures during the COVID pandemic: the failure to roll out vaccinations quickly enough, the failure to secure rapid antigen tests when they were needed and the failure to get stranded Australians home. They were tired of government ministers trying to undermine state and territory border controls by calling on premiers and chief ministers to open up before it was safe to do so. They were shocked that the previous government would join forces with the billionaire mining magnate to challenge state border restrictions in the High Court, support they only withdrew when they realised how unpopular it was. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians were tired of the government treating taxpayers' money like it was Liberal Party money. They were tired of the rorts and the government's refusal to establish a national anticorruption commission with real teeth. They were tired of seeing scandal after scandal when it came to issues of transparency and accountability: the sports rorts, the car park rorts, the overpriced land sales and overpriced water buybacks, the forging of documents to make a political point, the million-dollar blind trust used to fund court action against the ABC—and the list just goes on and on. The previous government took corruption and malfeasance to a level not seen since Joh Bjelke-Petersen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians were tired of the government refusing to take real action on climate change and continuing to make excuses for their lack of action. They were tired of seeing their wages stagnate while the cost of everything else was going up, yet the previous government had no plans to do anything about low wage growth or the cost of living. Haven't they changed their tune! Australians were tired of the neglect of older Australians in residential aged care. They were tired of the Prime Minister showing up for photo ops doing inane things, like building a chicken coop, cooking a curry or playing a banjo—not that well, I might add—yet going missing whenever there was a crisis or need for real leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians voted for a majority Labor government because we offered them a positive alternative. We offered a vision and a plan for a better future. In my reply to the Governor-General's address, I will outline three areas that are of particular interest to me in which the Albanese Labor government offers a positive alternative to the abysmal record of the previous government. Those areas are early childhood education and care, skills and training, and housing and homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn first to early childhood education and care. I have chosen to focus on this area because of my more than a decade of past experience as an early childhood educator. We know that child care is important for families, because it helps them to juggle their work and family responsibilities. This is particularly important for women, who tend to take on the bulk of caring responsibilities. We know from evidence both in Australia and overseas that subsidised child care helps boost women's participation in the workforce and is an important contributor to closing the gender pay gap. Given the importance of subsidised early childhood education and care, I found it particularly galling to hear this measure described by those on the other side as 'communism', a 'money pit' and 'the hand of government reaching in and taking away our children's youth'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that was the attitude of the previous government then it explains a lot about their childcare policies. Out-of-pocket costs for child care went up more than 40 per cent under the previous government. We even had the farcical situation where parents—mostly women—were sometimes only receiving a marginal financial benefit from taking on additional work. In some cases, it was even costing them more than they stood to earn. The policy Labor brought to the last election will make child care cheaper for 96 per cent of Australian families. That's 1.26 million families. It will lift the maximum subsidy to 90 per cent for families with their first child in child care and keep the higher and additional rates for the second and additional children. On top of this, we will get the Productivity Commission to conduct a comprehensive review into the sector, with the aim of implementing a universal 90 per cent subsidy for all families. The ACCC is to design a price-regulation mechanism to drive out-of-pocket costs down for good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsidising early childhood education and care is about a lot more than just driving workforce participation. As a former early childhood educator who understands the industry and the work that the educators do, I know that the benefits flow not just to the parents but also, importantly, to the children. This is why workers in the sector are called educators now instead of carers. Yes, they provide all the important care needs for children such as feeding, changing nappies and wiping runny noses, but educators also provide an age-appropriate program of play based learning aimed at specific learning outcomes. They train for years learning how to plan and implement this learning. They also undertake continuous professional development to maintain their skills and keep up to date with the latest knowledge and research on early childhood learning and development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a highly skilled, professional occupation that provides the foundation skills necessary to set children up for their school education. We know from research that children who engage in early learning get better learning outcomes for life. The early years before the age of five are considered to be a key time for learning development. Early childhood education contributes to so many aspects of learning: motor skills, social and emotional development, language skills and comprehension—and the list goes on. When we on this side of the chamber talk about cheaper child care and when we talked about it in the lead-up to the election, we are not just talking about reducing the cost of living for struggling Australian families. We're not just talking about driving workforce participation, getting more women into work and closing the gender pay gap, as important as they are. We are also talking about improving the learning outcomes of preschool aged children with skills that will potentially set them up for life. As a former educator I know the power of early childhood education because I've seen how it has transformed the lives of the children who were under my care and who I taught.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier the importance of Australians engaging in the workforce. For them to do that we need to give them the opportunity to get secure, high-paying jobs. The most secure and best-paying jobs are skilled jobs. The COVID pandemic has laid bare the extraordinary depth of the skills crisis Australia is facing. While Australia will always have a need to fill skills gaps with skilled migration, most Australians would agree we should prioritise getting Australians into skilled Australian jobs. Employers are crying out for skilled workers, yet there are still over a million Australians either looking for work or looking for more work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government didn't just fall asleep at the wheel when it came to tackling the Australian skills crisis; they crashed through the safety barrier and drove the car right over the cliff. Since coming to government those opposite reduced Australia's apprentice and training numbers by 70,000. They cut billions of dollars from TAFE and university, and their decision to abolish industry skills councils meant Australia was flying blind when it came to identifying and filling skills gaps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In one of my previous jobs I was a training coordinator for the Australian Services Union and I was the Tasmanian branch representative on two industry skills councils, with representatives of employers, employees and relevant unions, training providers and government. These councils all collaborated to try and improve the skills of Tasmanian people. The councils undertook such tasks as skills audits, curriculum development and writing, and advising on the implementation of training policies, as well as overseeing the process for approval of accredited training. This role helped me appreciate the importance of assessing skills needs, predicting future skills needs and working with stakeholders in the process. This capability is vital if you want to know where to invest to develop the skills you need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If filling skills shortages is like driving a car, investing in training and education is like putting petrol in the car, while having an authority to identify the skills needs is like having a map to navigate. There's no point driving around burning petrol if you don't know where you're going. Sadly, the previous government spent nine years draining the fuel tank, dismantling the engine and throwing the map right out the window. So it's now left to Labor to fix the skills crisis, and we will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government will establish Jobs and Skills Australia as a national partnership to strengthen workforce planning by working together with employers, unions and the training and education sector. We will provide 465,000 fee-free TAFE places for students studying industries with skills shortage, including 45,000 new places. And we will deliver up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023 with a particular focus on national priority areas like clean energy, advanced manufacturing, health and education and where there are skills shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even when Australians can get a secure, well-paying job, the dream of homeownership is becoming increasingly out of reach—particularly for young Australians. With soaring house prices, people who are renting are facing the double whammy of having to save for a deposit while spending more of their money on rent in a tighter, more competitive rental market. For the first time in Australia's history, median house prices have passed $1 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very appropriate that my colleague Julie Collins, the member for Franklin—in whose electorate my local office just happens to be based—has been appointed the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness. Minister Collins's electorate of Franklin covers most of the outer suburbs of Hobart, which now has the distinction of being the least affordable capital city for rental accommodation. We can see the disastrous consequences of this, with over 4,000 Tasmanians on the housing waiting list and the average waiting time being more than a year for priority applicants. Priority applicants have to wait more than a year. This means a lot of pain for people who are couch surfing, sleeping in emergency shelters or living in cars, tents or caravans. I can't begin to imagine how difficult it has been for Tasmania's homeless through the harsh winter we've just had. Only last week Hobart had snow down to 200 metres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shelter is a basic human need and, as such, it's a human right, but it's something that previous governments did almost nothing to provide during almost a decade in office. We now have a prime minister who truly understands the importance of social and affordable housing; after all, he grew up in public housing. Not only do we have a prime minister who grew up in public housing; our housing minister also spent the early years of her life in public housing. Building social and affordable housing works, and that's what Labor intends to do to address the housing crisis. That's why we will establish a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, the income from which will fund social and affordable housing in perpetuity. That includes 30,000 social and affordable homes across Australia in the first five years. Of course, providing secure affordable accommodation also means helping more people and their families to realise the great Australian dream of owning their own home. Forty years ago, almost 60 per cent of Australians on low and modest incomes owned their own home; now it's only 28 per cent. Labor's Help to Buy scheme will help 10,000 Australians a year reduce the cost of buying their own home by up to 40 per cent. This will mean a smaller deposit, a smaller mortgage and smaller repayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've outlined our plans in three important areas, but Labor's agenda for the future is so much bigger than that. We've got a lot of challenges to address, including rising inflation, an uncertain global trade and security environment, and a trillion-dollar debt. Many of these challenges are the legacy of the mess left to us through nine years of Liberal-National neglect. Cleaning up that mess is a big job. It will take a lot longer than the two months that we've been in government for, no matter what those on the other side say. You had nine years; we've had two months. But we have one of the most experienced and capable ministries in Australian history, and we also have a wealth of new talent on our backbench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were elected on the promise of delivering a better future for all Australians. With hard work and discipline, we're capable of delivering on that promise and we are getting on with the job of doing just that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I've had a surreal feeling here in Canberra during the last two weeks. We face, as a country, perhaps the biggest challenges since the 1930s, yet we have wasted our time in this parliament on issues that are not going to deliver real results for Australians and are not going to make our country stronger and more prepared for what might be to come. After two years of a pandemic, in 2022, we now face a year when war has erupted in Europe for the first time since the 1940s. This week, the Chinese Communist Party is, effectively, putting into place a blockade against Taiwan. We do not know, over the next year or two, what Australians might be called upon to do, particularly young Australians. This war in Europe now is metastasising, potentially to become a world war, and we will not be able to be completely immune from its impacts and effects. We should be preparing for that. We should be making our country more resilient and stronger and we should be getting back to being self-sufficient in basic things that we need to supply any type of economy during wartime. Instead, all this new government is focused on is symbolism and tokenism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning in the other place, a bill was passed to establish an emissions target for 2030—eight years time. Who knows what's going to happen in the next eight years? We do not know, yet we're setting a target. On the government's own admission, they don't really need the legislation. They've said that. They've said: 'We don't need the legislation. We're just doing it, effectively, to fill time.' I think there are other things we could be doing in this place, rather than just engaging in symbolism. Another thing we've been told we're going to have is an Indigenous voice, but, again, we're told: 'It won't have any real power. It's not going to be able to do anything. It won't be able to solve any issues for Indigenous people.' It will just be more politicians here in Canberra. More talk! What this country needs now is action, not talk. Yes, I agree with Senator Bilyk that this government is only a few months old, and they are still riding off the excuse that it's their first day on the job. Fair enough, but there is a lot of talk and not a lot of action here. And we as a country desperately need action, given the circumstances we find ourselves in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reply to the Governor-General's speech. I was making notes during the Governor-General's speech to us. In fairness to the Governor-General, it's not written by him; he just says it. When you look at the political speech the government put together here, it's often more what is not said than what is actually said that is key. In the speech of more than 20 minutes provided by the Governor-General to this chamber, there was not one single mention of Australia's mining industry, perhaps the greatest contributor to our nation's economy, particularly over the last couple of years. I'll come to some of our weaknesses, which we need to be honest about. But perhaps one of the shining lights in our economy, where we've become stronger, better and more self-sufficient in the last couple of decades, is our mining industry. We're the world's largest exporter of iron ore, the largest exporter of uranium, the largest exporter of coal and now, in just the last couple of years, the largest exporter of liquid natural gas. We are an important country because of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just today, we read the news that the shipment of coal that we donated to the Ukraine has arrived in Poland and will soon be providing power to Ukrainians. President Zelenskyy, just in the last few days, has thanked Australia for that contribution. We can contribute a lot to world security through what we mine and the energy we provide, particularly given the situation we see where the autocratic Russian regime is using its energy exports as leverage to gain control over and influence a wartime situation. We can help prevent those countries having that ability to dictate to weaker and smaller countries, that leverage over them, but only if we support our mining sector: our coal, oil, gas, iron ore and other industries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet that speech did not have a single mention of it. There wasn't even a mention of lithium, nickel or cobalt, which are the flavours of the month. But the biggest exports currently that we can help contribute are in those fossil fuel industries. Instead, we've heard over the past couple of weeks—I know the Greens are always going to want to shut down the coal, oil and gas industries—from the government, from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, that he agrees with the Greens, and he will find other ways to shut down these industries. He's not going to do it through this legislation I described, but he's going to use this thing called the safeguard mechanism. Isn't that an Orwellian term! Be very, very scared of something the government calls a safeguard mechanism. He's going to use this safeguard mechanism to shut down these industries. He's been telling the Greens sweet nothings about this. We don't know what they're saying behind closed doors. And that gives exactly the wrong impression to the thousands of Australians that work in our mining industry—and, as I said, how that industry can contribute to keeping and maintaining global peace and stability. The government just does not seem focused on that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They should be. They should be, because, while we have had a generation of success in our mining industry, it's a different story in our manufacturing sector. That has been in decline. We need to be honest about that, assess that and change that. It's been happening through various governments—I'm not blaming or being partisan to any side of politics. But, for decades now, our manufacturing sector has been in decline. In the year 2000 we were self-sufficient in raw petroleum. We could produce enough petroleum for our domestic needs. We exported a lot of it, but we still could be self-sufficient, push come to shove. We had 96 per cent of our raw petroleum needs produced here in Australia. Today that figure is below 50 per cent. We've lost two-thirds of our oil-refining capacity over that period. They're gone. So what happens if the sea lanes around us close and we can no longer import oil? We cannot—</span>

                  </a>  Yes. I'll take that interjection from Senator Antic. The response seems to be this: 'We've got lots of solar panels'—also made in China, by the way—'we've got lots of wind turbines, we're going to have these batteries, and it will all be all right.' We are not going to be able to defend this nation unless we can be self-sufficient in oil. That is going to be a key factor in any coming conflict in the region, and there is too little focus in this country right now on our deficiencies in oil, despite the fact there would be a lot more oil in this country if we had the guts to look for it and develop it, and despite the fact that there seem to be attempts to shut down the one shining hope in this country to produce more oil and become self-sufficient again, the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory. There are people here who want to shut that down. They're not talking about making Australians drive less or use less oil. We'll just import more of it from overseas and become more dependent, instead of becoming more independent as a nation and being able to use our God-given and abundant natural resources for the benefit of this country and the defence of our great nation. </span>

Therefore, they can provide quality industrial relations services to the 10,000 nurses and 3,000 teachers who have chosen to be represented by them at a cost of $250 to $300 less per year. Why does any government of any political persuasion have a right to attack the rights of our teachers and nurses to choose an industrial relations organisation to represent them? I stand shoulder to shoulder with Queensland nurses and Queensland teachers to defend their right to freedom of choice and their right to choose the industrial relations organisation that is unaffiliated with the Australian Labor Party.</span>

I join the Senate today as the Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef on an incredibly important day for the reef. Today we've had the release of a report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. This report has some good news stories for our reef and the people that rely on the reef for their jobs. This report, released today, says that there is coral recovery in the north and central parts of our reef. This is the highest level of coral recovery in the last 36 years—since the long-term monitoring program began. There are still some challenges on the southern part of our reef: there are some outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish that need to be managed and that are seeing increases since the southern parts of the reef have had warmer waters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be really clear about this. This report has some good news, but it also makes clear that the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change on a long-term basis, and that is why our government has today decided to legislate climate action in making sure that we can legislate our 43 per cent emissions target. We said we would do it at the election and we have delivered on that today. It is shameful that members of the Liberal and National parties voted against this legislation—the member for Leichardt, the former special envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, voted against this legislation today. If they are really serious about protecting regional jobs and the jobs that rely on the Great Barrier Reef, they will move on from the old dinosaur years and their policies that meant that we had a decade of delay and denials and damage to one of our greatest natural assets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The world is in the process of transitioning away from fossil fuels towards a decarbonised economy fuelled by renewable energy. Coal is on the way out already, and we must make sure that the workers in the coal industry and their families are taken care of. Regional workers in Australia working in the coal industry deserve a just fully funded transition to support them, their families and the communities. Workers across regional Australia know that a transition to low-emissions industries will happen, and they don't appreciate the scare campaigns being run by members of the Liberal and National parties. Scare campaigns help no-one, and they do nothing to change the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want well paid, stable employment for people in communities currently engaged in the fossil fuel industry. We're working to secure that future so that workers will have opportunities for gainful employment in other industries. The Greens are the only party facing the reality of the energy transition, and we're the only party who took a comprehensive and costed transition plan to the election. No coal worker should experience the financial insecurity and anxiety for the future that comes with losing their job suddenly. With a carefully planned transition, we can assure workers that they will have rewarding jobs until their retirement and that their families, especially their children, will have strong services and employment options in the towns and communities that they know and love. Our regional communities will have a bright future, long after the last bit of coal is shovelled out of the ground, but only if we plan the transition well and we start planning it now. </span>

Anyone—anyone—who has taken the time to visit these regions will see the benefits to the women, children and elders who are now being far more protected. The card should be extended, and not repealed. The reduction of taxpayer funded access to drugs, alcohol and gambling products has significantly reduced alcohol and drug abuse. It has reduced assaults, child abuse, rape and death. It also makes people less vulnerable to humbugging. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it clear: the Albanese government has not properly consulted with the very people who will be so badly impacted by this measure. It is a complete and utter disgrace. It is also a disgrace today—today—that senators have voted to restrict community hearings around the nation. Can I say, shame on all of you who voted to restrict the hearings. I see Senator David Pocock is in the chamber. Can I say, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Dean Smith, I hope you attend every single one of those restricted hearings that you have voted for. You should go and look the women, children and elders in the eye and explain to them why you have taken this decision. You should go out on one of the night patrols or several night patrols in several towns to see exactly the consequences on the police and on the other community services, the hospitals, of the actions that you are about to take. It is inconceivable to me and those on this side of the chamber that any government or any senator would knowingly inflict pain and suffering on vulnerable women, children and the elderly. Make no mistake: all who vote for this bill will be culpable for the inevitable consequences that you will inflict on local communities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I've had the pleasure of being the co-convenor of the Parliamentary Friends of Landcare in the last parliament and I hope to do so in this parliament, the 47th Parliament. I hope that all my Senate colleagues received my recent communication, with Senator Perin Davey, on joining the group stating that we celebrate the great work that many Landcare organisations do across our country. Since I was first a senator, I've enjoyed engaging with many Landcare volunteers right across my home state of Victoria. It is a wonderful organisation, full of extraordinary people who dedicate themselves to restoring, enhancing and protecting the natural environment which our communities enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Landcare has been bringing volunteers together to undertake activities and share information for over 30 years. It first started in my home state, in Victoria, with the Victorian Farmers Federation and many Landcare groups. It's great to see where it has gotten to today in 2022. Over 6,000 Landcare groups are active right across Australia, with over 100,000 volunteers. Unfortunately, there is more work than ever for these volunteers to do. With the increasing frequency of natural disasters, like floods and bushfires, landcare has never been more important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work these volunteers do is invaluable, and they come from all walks of life, so it is fitting that the theme for Landcare week is 'celebrating landcare diversity'. It doesn't matter if you live in the regions or in the city or whether you work on a farm or in the office. I encourage all Australians to seek out their local Landcare group and get involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  This is not my first speech. The cost of everything is going up—lettuce, fuel, your mortgage repayments. It's tough out there to make ends meet. Do you know what isn't going up, though? Community care funding—at least, not by enough for organisations to survive on. Community care helps with all the things that get a little bit harder when you get older—things like mowing the lawn or fixing a fence, transport to doctors appointments and cleaning your house. It's an important service that people rely on. This year, funding is increasing by just 1.7 per cent. Community care providers have to put that towards increased wages, super contributions, insurance and loan or rent repayments, and those numbers just don't add up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providers don't deserve it. Their staff are the people we trust to look after our mums and dads and our grandparents, and they need our support. I know because my partner, Tim, works in the aged-care industry. I see the long hours he does. I see the times he's gone hours without a drink or potty break because he's been kitted up in PPE, the sadness when he comes home and tells me one of his patients has passed away, and the smile on his face when he tells me about their adventures—that Glynis felt well enough to dance today or Tim sang along to John's favourite song. It's a hard job, and when bigger organisations can offer way better money for easier jobs it's not hard to see how small organisations are losing staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NDIS funding is going up by nine per cent this year, almost four times as much as community care funding. That allows for the increase in minimum wages and superannuation. If community care is facing the same increases, then why aren't they getting the same funding? They do similar work. Community care workers deserve more funding, just like the NDIS. It's not asking for the world. It's what they need to cover the bare minimum.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  If the new Treasurer and finance minister genuinely want to protect the budget, they will ensure that the Brisbane Olympic Games sporting infrastructure body that was part of the fifty-fifty funding deal between the Commonwealth and the Queensland state government is put in place. We know Queensland desperately does not want the discipline and oversight of this agency, but, as we've seen in recent weeks, there is a genuine need for proper control of spending and decisions relating to the delivery of the games' sporting infrastructure to the tune of billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, reports came of proposed changes to venues that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars extra, with the Commonwealth on the hook for 50 per cent of that. Queensland minister Grace Grace, describing the Gabba project, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We do not know the footprint. We do not know the design. We have a schematic sketch. We are still stabbing in the dark.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frightening warnings indeed! If Australian taxpayers are in any way to be protected from the excesses of the scandal-ridden Queensland government in the decision-making and timely delivery of these major investments, the full deal must be insisted on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that the only reason the 2032 Olympic Games are going ahead is that the Commonwealth government agreed to fund 50 per cent of the sporting infrastructure costs. The Queensland government said they would not bid unless we did. These Olympics will be a powerhouse for the country, with thousands of jobs and significant investment, but let's not lose sight of sound planning and prudent investment in the lead-up.</span>

Just 10 weeks ago, new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised that Labor would work hard every day to bring Australians together, to build a better, brighter future for all. And, true to this promise, we have hit the ground running.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are my top 10 reforms of our first 10 weeks. First, we successfully supported a wage increase for Australia's lowest-paid workers. Second, we wrote to Fair Work for a pay rise for our essential aged-care workers. Third, we passed legislation to help fix aged-care quality and safety. Fourth, we established a Jobs and Skills Summit to deliver good, secure jobs. Fifth, we introduced legislation to tackle the skills crisis. Sixth, we restored our reputation on the world stage. Seventh, we committed to reducing emissions, and today we delivered in the House. Eighth, we introduced legislation for paid family and domestic violence leave. Ninth, we moved to scrap the cashless debit card. Tenth, we took the first steps towards enshrining a First Nations Voice to parliament, and I could not be more proud.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've taken action on jobs and wages. We've rebuilt our global reputation. And we have put respect at the heart of government. And this is just the beginning. So get used to it, on the opposition benches! There is much more to do. In just 10 weeks, we've done what the previous government failed to do in almost 10 years. This is what good government can do. This is what Labor governments always do: we work hard every day for the people of Australia, and we get the job done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  This week the government announced a review into the Australian Defence Force, but we don't need a review to tell us what we already know. Former chief of the ADF Chris Barrie has made it clear that climate change is one of the largest security threats to Australia and our very vulnerable region. Yet it receives little more than lip-service in Australia's defence policy. We also know that, over the last decade, Defence has overseen repeated multibillion-dollar budget blow-outs across the portfolio, with chronic project delays, despite a budget that grows year on year. It's troubling that this review is being undertaken by two of the key architects of the current defence posture, and it's difficult to see how they can turn a genuinely independent mind to the task. For all these reasons, the Greens will be closely monitoring this review and the major parties' continued uncritical support of excessive military expenditure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, 5 August, is the third anniversary of the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which stripped away Jammu and Kashmir's constitutional protections and autonomy. This is a day of mourning for the people of Jammu and Kashmir and for the diaspora here in Australia—indeed, across the globe. The Australian Greens acknowledge the rights of the peoples of Jammu and Kashmir to freedom and self-determination. We also acknowledge and support the work of the diaspora to bring global awareness to this human rights crisis. The Australian government has an obligation to raise the attacks on Jammu and Kashmir in its diplomatic engagement with India. This is about Australia speaking the truth to our friends and acknowledging the universal rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to basic human freedoms.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  This has been a history-making week. Today the House of Representatives passed the government's climate change bill, legislating for the first time a 2030 and a 2050 target. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed the Restoring Territory Rights Bill. The next time we sit in this place, we will have to vote on both of these critical pieces of legislation. Today I would like to talk about the latter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my new colleagues: I look forward to having discussions about the territory rights bill and your support for giving the people in my electorate the same rights as the people who live in yours. The people of the ACT and Northern Territory deserve the same democratic rights as those who live in the states. Someone who lives in Tuggeranong or Gungahlin should have the same rights as people who live just across the border in Queanbeyan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill simply seeks to restore rights that were removed from the territories in 1997. I ask you to join with me in putting an end to this quarter-century-old injustice. The bill enables the people of the NT and ACT, through our elected territory parliaments, to have the conversation on whether they want to legislate a voluntary assisted dying scheme. Every state has now had this debate, starting with Victoria and ending with New South Wales. There is no reason the ACT and NT shouldn't be able to engage in the same discussions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the deeply-held convictions on this matter, but I also remind everyone that no-one is being asked to actually legislate on voluntary assisted dying in this place. This is about territory rights and whether or not we think that people who live in the territories should have the same rights as those who live in the states when it comes to debating and legislating voluntary assisted dying.</span>

Yesterday both of those parties took out the gold medal in the hypocrisy olympics. In fact, yesterday the Australian Labor Party, the self-appointed champions of transparency, proved themselves to be really nothing more than the champions of hypocrisy with their partners in pretence, the Australian Greens, by voting against my motion seeking transparency of parliamentary interactions with NGOs like the World Economic Forum. We weren't talking simply about a referral to change the register of interests; we were talking about a simple referral to a parliamentary committee.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I raise the issue about hypocrisy is that less than 24 hours earlier, in question time in this chamber, we had an interaction from a question posed by Senator Lambie, who asked a question about transparency in super funds. Senator Gallagher responded with:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No, we are a big supporter of transparency and we'll be a lot more transparent in a whole range of areas than those opposite have ever been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-four hours later, they voted against a simple referral to committee to try to get this investigated on the register of interests.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These self-styled champions of democracy and openness simply wouldn't have it. They wouldn't have an addition to the register of interests. In essence, all it sought to do was to have members of this place record any association or involvement with lobbying groups or NGOs, charitable foundations or international societies, like, for example, the World Economic Forum, which is led by Klaus Schwab. I had 55,000 signatures on a social media campaign on this. The people in this area, those opposite, clearly talk the talk when it comes to transparency but simply cannot walk the walk. My question is: what are they trying to hide?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  The Australian Institute of Marine Science annual report has found that the Great Barrier Reef central section and northern section now have record coral cover. A natural event, a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak, prevented the southern section reaching record coral cover too. For millennia the reef has witnessed natural events causing coral bleaching. Bleaching results when periods of high solar activity coincide with low tides, when the water cover is insufficient to protect the coral polyps and they die, meaning the reef bleaches. And then it recovers just as quickly, every time. Tropical cyclones bleach the reef and floods deliver fresh water plumes onto the reef, killing saltwater coral polyps. Once the plume dissipates, marine life consumes the nutrients in the floodwaters and the sediment turns into sand. The reef and the coastal environment are renewed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, in June 2008, record cold temperatures in Queensland caused coral bleaching. For millennia, natural solar, lunar and rain cycles have caused bleaching. What is new is the late 20th century environmental movement hijacking the perfectly normal climate cycle for their own political benefit. If your party's real objective is to control every aspect of life on the reef and along the coast, then be honest and have that debate. The only argument the climate fraudsters can advance in favour of onerous reductions in farm output is 'save the reef'. Well, the reef does not need saving and never has. The public has been deceived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The left are seeking to shut down agriculture and transfer food production to near urban intensive food production facilities manufacturing food-like substances. Who will own these facilities? Not nature but predatory billionaires, the same predatory billionaires who own and drive the environmental movement for their own benefit. We have one flag, we are one community, we are one nation and we will continue to stand up for our farmers' right to feed and clothe the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Like so many women across Australia, including women here in this chamber, I've experienced sexual harassment in more than one workplace. I know firsthand that when such a thing happens there's nothing more important than sharing your experience and having the support of fellow workers, family, friends, trade unions and specialist support organisations. I personally found such support essential. All women, no matter what their background or where they live or work, should be able to readily access the support they need if they experience assault, sexual harassment or discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of this, today I'd like to highlight the important work of independent working women's centres, as illustrated by the work of the South Australian Working Women's Centre. I'd like to recognise that both our party and the Labor Party committed in the election to the implementation of recommendation 49 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect</span><span style="font-style:italic;">@Work</span> report, which was to establish and fund working women's centres in every state and territory. The Working Women's Centre in South Australia is a place that I'm incredibly proud of and a model that provides confidential, independent advice to a wide range of vulnerable women who experience all kinds of workplace challenges. In the 2021-22 financial year, some of their achievements included recovering over a million dollars in compensation and lost wages and helping nearly 2½ thousand workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre supports diverse and vulnerable women. Almost half their clients are engaged in precarious work and nearly half live with a disability. These stats demonstrate the vital and highly effective service provided by the South Australian centre, and I want to acknowledge their work; their current director, Abbey Kendall; and the many directors, board members and staff who preceded her. They do an amazing job. Every state and territory in Australia needs a centre this good. I look forward to the government acting on their commitment to establishing such a centre in every state and territory in the near future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  In 2007, prior to what was declared an emergency in the Northern Territory, alcohol and sexual abuse were put on a national platform, shocking the rest of the nation. The Territory's Martin Labor government could not hide its inept leadership on such important social issues. Pat Anderson, the co-chair of the 2007 Northern Territory Board of Inquiry into the Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse, stated:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Alcohol is absolutely totally destroying our communities and our families. There is no doubt about that. Something serious needs to be done to curb this river of grog. It's killing people, spiritually, physically, psychologically, there's a total breakdown in families when people are sort of drunk, most of the time, and everyone around them. And children are not safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McCarthy's family community of Borroloola was showcased on national media, showing the devastation for the whole community as a result of the high consumption of alcohol.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast-forward 15 years and we are back to the rivers of grog flowing, thanks to another inept Territory Labor government claiming that the Stronger Futures legislation introduced in 2012 was racist. I ask: racist to who? The drunks? The victims of financial and physical abuse? Was it racist to the children who are born with FASD and have to live with the disorder for the rest of their lives? What was an emergency is now a crisis. I will hold to account this federal Labor government for the failings of the Territory government, because they are one party and they have power over vulnerable constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, communities like Borroloola's are expressing grave concerns about the return of alcohol and going back to the old ways. I call on the federal Labor government to hold to account their Territory counterparts, as the member for Lingiari has so bravely done, for their failure to reduce alcohol-led harm and violence despite the coalition's billions of dollars of investment, in the name of human rights for all Territorians. These are the practical measures that I'm focused on for all Territorians: holding to account those who have been funded to deliver services and save lives but who have failed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you, President. The COVID shield will cease on 1 August 2022. From this time the functions of the National COVID Vaccine Taskforce will return to the arrangements within the Department of Health and Aged Care. The Coordinator-General of the COVID shield, General Frewen—who I had the good fortune to meet last night and congratulate on the role he has performed in this area—will return to his role as the Chief of Joint Capabilities in the Department of Defence. The Australian government has ensured that the national COVID-19 vaccination program is providing support for people in Australia who need to maintain their protection— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Obviously, this is not my normal area of responsibility. I know that the country has continued to increase and improve the level of vaccination in this area, and I will be very happy to get those figures for the minister. In fact, I right now have the answer to those questions. I thank Senator Gallagher, who does represent the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the very hardworking Mr Butler. Over three-quarters of residents estimated to be eligible for a fourth dose have received a fourth dose, up from around 50 per cent in June 2022, following efforts by the government. </span>

The Albanese government's climate change bill is a move to end the climate wars—to say goodbye and good riddance to the nine years of delay, dysfunction, denial and denigration from the previous government. The fact is that Australia didn't just stand still under the former government; we went backwards. Our reputation on the international stage and investment confidence were stifled. The legislation that's passed the House is good for jobs, for power bills, for the economy and for our future.</span>

While our government is acting and working with the parliament in a constructive and open fashion, those on the other side have not learnt anything—well, maybe some of them have; we think some of them may have learnt something. Those opposite are ignoring the message that the Australian people sent them in May. They're also ignoring the broad coalition of support for the bill from right across the business community: the Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Australian Energy Council, the Governance Institute of Australia, Responsible Investment Association Australasia, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Rio Tinto, and the NAB. There are plenty of others who also support these bills, and it's time for the opposition to support them, too.</span>

The fact is that climate change policy is energy policy and it's good economic policy. We can drive down emissions and drive down power bills at the same time. Our detailed Powering Australia plan will create 604,000 jobs, with five out of six of them to be created in the regions. The plan will spur $76 billion worth of investment, and it will deliver 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, consistent with AEMO's step-change scenario, which projects 83 per cent renewable energy. The Powering Australia plan includes modernising our ageing electricity grid, investing in renewable metals and renewable energy, 85 solar banks, 400 community batteries, 10,000 new energy apprenticeships and a new energy skills program—showing how we can seize the opportunity that comes from this change.</span>

Despite what Senator Ruston said, I will preface my comments, because I had 15 years experience on one of the best and the biggest superannuation funds in this country. And on not one occasion was a political donation made to either the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or any other party. So this idea that, particularly, industry super funds are out there handing out moneys to political parties, particularly the Labor Party, is simply untrue. We used to talk about fake news. You don't hear it so often since President Trump has gone. Senator Bragg, this is fake news. </span>

What the Labor Party wants to see is the best retirement possible for Australian workers from their industry superannuation fund, the best that that fund can deliver for them. That's what the Labor Party wants, and I think that's actually what the members of industry superannuation funds want. They want the people who represent them on the boards of those organisations to do their level best to get the absolute best returns. That's what the board members of those funds should be working on. Just remember that there's an obligation on every single member of a superannuation board to deliver the best results for their members, and that's what I believe every single industry fund in this country is doing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Prime Minister has said that the government has been working behind the scenes and engaging in quiet diplomacy regarding the extradition of Julian Assange. But quiet diplomacy can't be no diplomacy. What exactly is the government doing to secure the release of this Australian citizen, journalist and whistleblower? </span>

I think this might be your first question, and it's on a very important topic and that relates to Mr Julian Assange. The Australian government have been clear in our view that Mr Assange's case has dragged on for too long and that it should now be brought to a close. This is the view that we continue to convey to the governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States, along with our expectations that Mr Assange is entitled to due process, humane and fair treatment, access to proper medical care and access to his legal team. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, not all foreign affairs is best conducted with a loudhailer or a megaphone, as we saw from the previous government. It's also worth noting that the extradition case is between the United States and the United Kingdom, a legal system that we respect. Australia, of course, is not a party to Mr Assange's case, and, as the legal operations still stand, our government, I'm advised, cannot intervene in the legal matters of another country, just as we wouldn't want those countries to intervene in our legal process. We will continue to monitor the case closely and we continue to seek assurances from the United Kingdom government about Mr Assange's welfare and his treatment. </span>

As I have consistently said, the first point to make on anything regarding this matter is that Australia remains foot-and-mouth disease free, and the Albanese government is working hard in partnership with the states, territories and industries to keep it that way. While the risk of foot-and-mouth disease or lumpy skin disease entering Australia is low, it is not zero. As I've said before, experts have assessed the risk of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Australia over the next five years as 11.6 per cent and a lumpy skin disease outbreak as 28 per cent. We cannot assume it will stay that way, and that's why we need to keep doing more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've previously spoken of our two-pronged approach: taking action at home and abroad. Today, I'm pleased to announce a new, third prong: taking action now to make sure we will be fully prepared if an outbreak were to occur here. That's why, earlier today, I announced the creation of a new exotic animal disease task force to ensure Australia is fully prepared to respond swiftly to growing biosecurity threats. The task force will thoroughly assess our current level of national preparedness and advise of any improvements needed. While the federal, state and territory governments all have well-developed security response plans in place, we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that we are ready should an outbreak occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this task force will be a vehicle for collaboration across the Commonwealth, and it will be co-chaired by senior officials from Emergency Management Australia and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It will also include officials from the Defence Force, Border Force, and Animal Health Australia. By bringing together the best expertise from across government, we can ensure there are no gaps in our response. I note the National Farmers Federation has welcomed this announcement, saying, 'It's the right idea', and this continues the close partnership between the Albanese government and industry in managing biosecurity. Good governments plan for the best and prepare for the worst; that's exactly what we are doing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

As I have said before, biosecurity is everyone's responsibility, from the federal government through to state and territory governments as well as farmers, importers, exporters and international travellers. Last night I spoke with each state and territory agriculture minister to inform them of the establishment of the federal exotic animal disease preparedness task force and to discuss their own efforts to prepare for a foot-and-mouth disease or lumpy skin disease outbreak should one occur. While the task force will comprise federal officials, it will work closely with states and territories. We have also spoken with industry to ensure that their views are being heard, and they will be engaged to assist the task force as required.</span>

As we all remember, the response to COVID-19 was the most important global human health response in recent memory. If we have learned one thing from this experience, it is that the Australian government needs to be prepared ahead of time for an event as potentially catastrophic as an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and that means working with all levels of government in a constructive and respectful way. We are not determined not to make the same mistakes the previous government did.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When COVID hit, the former coalition government weren't prepared. They were slow to close borders, leaving management to the states; slow on RATs; and too slow on vaccines. Of course Australians paid the price. When floods and fires hit, the former coalition government wasn't prepared. When the former fire chiefs tried to warn them about what was coming, the former government wouldn't even meet them. We won't make the same mistake. If there were to be a major biosecurity outbreak in Australia, there would simply be no time to delay, and that's why we have implemented the strongest biosecurity response ever and why we will keep working on preparedness. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

Minister, there are a lot of elderly people in my neck of the woods who rely on community carers to get transport to and from doctor appointments, mow their lawns and clean their houses. Like all of us, the people running community care are paying more on fuel, wages, insurance and rent, but the funding for home-care packages and the Commonwealth Home Support Program is only going up 1.7 per cent this year. How does your government expect community care providers to survive on so little?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You raised the issue of support for home care and community care services and the indexation rate. This is an issue that has been raised with me in my role as the Minister for Finance, not just from an aged-care point of view but for the majority of those working in the non-government sector at the moment, so this is something that I am looking at closely. There are a range of different ways that indexation applies across payments and programs, and there are even differences between particular programs getting indexed differently, so I am having a close look at that. My understanding is that the Department of Health and Aged Care is aware of the issue. They're working with the sector and looking at a range of approaches to manage some of these impacts on service provision. I would say that there has been significant investment into the service system over the last couple of years, but the government accepts that, with inflation running as high as it is, that is having costs on services. It's a matter I'm looking at as the Minister for Finance.</span>

As I said, there are a range of different indexation arrangements across government. The government would not want to see essential community services cease providing services. They are essential, particularly in areas where there might not be choice of service as well, where restrictions are there just because of the nature of the service system. I would say the government doesn't want to see any of those services close based on escalating costs, and we would ask that the organisations engage either with the department or with the minister's office.</span>

It has received increases in funding. I would note that since we've come to government we have delayed the implementation for the new in-home aged-care program by 12 months because we had been getting feedback from people about it being too rigid to support older Australians and the conditions and circumstances and the nature of house support provided. So that is something that we're doing, and we will consult widely and talk to all of those organisations about the best way forward. But our position is that we need that extra 12 months. That's in line with the royal commission. And, whilst there are significant resources—I think in the order of over $6 billion a year—going into home care at the moment— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In 2012, when announcing an additional 450 gigalitres of water recovery over and above sustainable diversion limits detailed in the Basin Plan, then Prime Minister Gillard said the water would be recovered via 'water recovery projects that minimise the impact on communities to ensure there is no social and economic downside for communities'. This intent was then written into the 2012 Basin Plan. Does the new Labor government stand by the 2012 commitment to communities for no negative social and economic impacts?</span>

What the federal Albanese government stands by, Senator, and what Minister Plibersek stands by, is the commitment that we made when we were last in government to restore the health of the mighty river system, the Murray-Darling river system, and, in doing that, ensure that the 450 gigalitres of water that were promised to that river system are delivered upon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want life to be any harder for inland communities in this country. There was significant consultation at the time that that plan was delivered. I, in fact, was the deputy water minister to Minister Burke who delivered that system. We made a promise to the people of Australia. We made a promise to all of those people whose livelihood survives along that river system, and the promise that we made was we'll deliver that 450 gigalitres of water.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it wasn't just the federal government that entered into that understanding, that promise; it was all of the state governments, including those governments that are of a Liberal persuasion now, like New South Wales. So, the federal government and the state governments all committed to the delivery of that 450 gigalitres, and we intend to do it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But in 2018—you mentioned basin state ministers, and I appreciate the segue—all basin state ministers, including the Labor South Australian minister and the Labor Victorian minister, agreed to a set of criteria by which they could assess that there would be no negative social or economic impacts from this water recovery.

That has been the commitment of the state governments to what the Labor Party committed to when we were in government more than nine years ago, and that was the delivery of 450 gigalitres of water. I notice we haven't got one of the South Australians asking this question. The South Australians haven't asked this question because they know that the most important thing for the South Australian community—and I'm speaking now as a South Australian senator—is the delivery of that 450 gigalitres.

We know just what the droughts in the early part of this century did to the communities along those rivers and we know what they did to people in South Australia.

Minister, the CSIRO states that energy production is the largest contributor to Australia's carbon dioxide output. The government has made it clear that it intends to ram through legislation which would see a reduction in carbon dioxide output of 43 per cent. I am concerned that this will cause energy prices to increase. Australian families are already struggling with cost-of-living pressures. Can the minister make the Senate aware of how the government will achieve these cuts in emissions, and will this result in increased power prices for the average Australian?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of our plan, the legislation that passed the House earlier today, and will now come to the Senate, implements our election commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent. We went to the election with very detailed modelling on how we would achieve that: the Powering Australia plan, which is available online to all. The clear impact of that modelling showed that, if we were to implement it—to ensure that we are building a new grid, to enable 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030; providing the investment certainty that is needed to allow those investment dollars to flow; investing in new energy technology, like solar banks and community batteries; building the workforce; and reducing taxes on electric vehicles—it would also put downward pressure on energy prices. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we all accept that the previous government did nothing for nine years and left us in a situation where we have escalating electricity prices, in particular, that they hid from the community before the last election—a 19.7 per cent increase in electricity prices. Our plan, which is the cheapest form of energy at the moment, is renewable energy. The cost of coal is expected to be $141 and gas $133 by 2030; in contrast, the cost of renewables, which we want to invest in, is $63 a megawatt hour. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's a comprehensive and transparent plan. It involves modernising Australia's ageing electricity grid through the Rewiring the Nation plan. There's a $3 billion investment in renewable metals, renewable energy, component manufacturing, renewable hydrogen, electrolysers, 85 solar banks, 400 community batteries and investments in our workforce to make sure we have the workforce to deliver on those—604,000 jobs, with five out of six of them in the regions, and $76 billion worth of investment. This is the opportunity that the Australian people need their government to seize—to drive jobs, to reduce power prices, to invest in the new technologies of the future and to ensure that we can seize the energy improvements that we need to bring down our greenhouse gas emissions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We've been upfront about our plans. We won't be cutting agricultural production. The National Farmers Federation supports our updated targets. There are huge opportunities, I think, in the agricultural sector. I know that Minister Watt is engaging with all of the stakeholders on those. And we have broad-ranging support right across industry for this plan, because—after 10 years of this lot—they see what's happening out there. They see the opportunities, the jobs and the improvements for their areas that will come from having a government that can provide industry with the certainty that they need to make the investments and make the change that is coming. It's not only important for our power bills and prices; it's important for jobs, and it's important for those essential industries, like agriculture, which will be part of the change. </span>

Look, I'm disappointed to go back in time, but who could forget the sports rorts affair of the former government and the so-called colour-coded spreadsheets, which we still haven't yet got an explanation for? Despite an inquiry that was conducted by Assistant Minister Chisholm, we still haven't got answers to what went on there. And all of the electorates—</span>

What a disgrace. We lost those markets. The sorts of farmers that Senator Brockman is talking about on the Eyre Peninsula or the Yorke Peninsula—they make amazing products, and we are going to look after them. And I can assure Senator Brockman that, in every single free trade agreement that we enter into, we will ensure the interests of our farmers are protected in a way that was never done—that was never, ever done—by the former government in the last nine years. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  On a matter of privilege, by a letter dated 25 May 2022, the chair of the Environment and Communications References Committee, Senator Hanson-Young, has raised a matter of privilege relating to the failure of representatives of a resource company, Tamboran Resources Ltd, to attend and give evidence to the committee when ordered to do so. I table the letter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter was the subject of an interim report of the committee's inquiry into oil and gas exploration and production in the Beetaloo basin. Senator Hanson-Young seeks to have the conduct of the company's representatives referred to the Privileges Committee for inquiry as a possible contempt. Where a matter of privilege is raised my role is to determine whether it should have precedence in debate. In doing so I am guided by the Senate's privilege resolutions, which seek to reserve the Senate's contempt powers for matters involving substantial obstruction to the Senate and its committees, or to senators performing their duties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has declared in privilege resolution 6 that disobedience of lawful Senate orders and refusal to attend before a committee when ordered to do so may be dealt with as contempts. On the question of obstruction, the chair's letter notes that the committee has been prevented from examining key evidence, as a result completing its inquiry and reporting to the Senate. Only the Senate can remedy such conduct, so in my view the relevant criteria are met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have therefore determined that it would be appropriate to grant the matter precedence as a matter of privilege. However, given that the matter was raised by a committee of the previous parliament, I intend to ask the newly established references committee whether it wishes to proceed in the Senate at this time or whether it wishes to consider other actions first. This might include reiterating the requirement for the witnesses to attend, with the knowledge that preliminary steps have been taken to have the matter dealt with as a contempt. If the committee wishes to proceed with the matter in the Senate, it will be dealt with as a matter of privilege. It will then be for the Senate to determine whether the matter warrants investigation as a possible contempt.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  As much as it pains me, because the minister has been so kind today, I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade and Tourism (Senator Farrell) to a question without notice asked by Senator Brockman today relating to international trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current negotiations in relation to the EU free trade agreement are extremely important, and the questions raised by Senator Brockman, likewise, are extremely important. Australian farmers are some of the least subsidised in the world, unlike a lot of their counterparts in other jurisdictions. Consequently, they are the most innovative and some of the most competitive in the world. They need to retain access to all the innovations they have developed and built over time through significant investment by themselves and by the Australian government, through the Australian government's research and development corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that, over the last nine years, the previous government was the most successful in history in relation to the negotiation of free trade agreements. It commenced very early in government with the Korean free trade agreement, which increased the share of trade covered by free trade agreements from 27 per cent to over 70 per cent. If the government were to ratify the free trade agreements that sit with India and the UK, that number would go to over 80 per cent of Australia's trade. They are very important figures. So I would urge the government to ensure that the work of the committee considering the free trade agreements is progressed but to ensure that, in the negotiations, as Senator Farrell said in his answer, our farmers are protected in respect of the use of those critical farming methods and tools that go to our capacity to maintain our land quality, which is extremely important—Australian farmers have done a brilliant job in developing those technologies and those systems all over Australia—and those critical chemicals and supports that allow them to do that. As we indicated in the previous question, not only does it prevent erosion and help support soil quality, but it also helps them to sequester carbon. So those important elements—and maintaining access to those things and not disadvantaging Australian farmers in trade—are going to be extremely important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The record of the previous government in respect of free trade agreements signed with Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Peru, Indonesia and, of course, across the Indo-Pacific have opened up enormous opportunities for farmers in this country. We need to maintain those opportunities. We need to continue to grow them. That's why we commenced and completed the negotiations with the UK. It's disappointing that in the previous parliament, the proceedings inside the treaties committee were delayed by seeking additional hearings. I certainly hope that that can be progressed quickly now that we're into this new parliament so that the farmers get those opportunities that come from the UK Free Trade Agreement and the Indian free trade agreement. Through the disruption over the last couple of years, we've seen that those opportunities, the expansion of markets, are extremely important to Australian agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The option to look at different markets when a disruption occurs in one significant market is now very well understood by us all. But let's not forget that the previous government, through all of its work, opened up so many opportunities, more than any other government in history, bearing in mind that the government before us did not complete a single free trade agreement. The challenge sits there right now for this government to ratify the two free trade agreements that were completed just before the election, particularly the free trade agreement negotiations with Europe. I know that Minister Farrell understands only too well from his involvement in the wine industry that there are some particular protections that are very, very sensitive to Australian agriculture, and he needs to protect them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  I rise in response to the contribution we've just heard from Senator Colbeck and to enhance the comments put on the record today by our fine new Minister for Trade and Tourism, Minister Farrell. Minister Farrell happens to be a good friend of mine. I felt particularly encouraged by his deep knowledge of the wine industry from his own life experience, because I'm sure he'll be out there fighting not only for the wine industry but for all elements of the agricultural industry. It's such a vital part of Australia's economic sense of engagement with the world and the sense of ourselves as a nation. We know that we are critical to the way in which the planet can eat food. Moving around to the world, we know, has been profoundly interrupted by what's going on in the Ukraine. And I know that there are calls on Australia, right now, to step up and interact, in trade, in markets that have been profoundly disrupted not only by that war but also by the supply chain problems that we see as a consequence of the COVID-19 reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade opportunities for Australians are vitally important to the Australian people, and not only will Senator Farrell be leading the charge on that but I and other members will be new members on that treaty's committee. I find it very disappointing, given how important it is to our economy, that we've had questions that seek to really create a bipartisan view of what should be happening in the area of trade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On parliamentary delegations, I'm pleased to let people know, as we move around the world we go out as 'team Australia' to fight for our country. It should be the same case with trade negotiations and the establishment of trade deals that benefit the country. It doesn't help our cause that the previous government, now in opposition, are going to moan and bleat about what's going on, right now, when they failed, on their own evidence here before the parliament today, when the India and the UK free trade deals are just sitting there waiting to be implemented. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's, classically, what we saw with this government—so many failures to show up and do the day job of government that's required, to get on with the hard yards of bringing those agreements to fruition, undertaking the necessary work, through treaties and through good conversation behind the scenes, to bring forward a good outcome for Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Colbeck said, the India and UK trade deals are just sitting there. The former government allowed them to sit there and failed to manage the processes of the government properly to deliver an advantage to this country. Because of that—for that very common phenomenon that we saw with this previous government of sitting on their hands, waiting for things to get done that they were responsible for, that they failed to enact—we are in a situation where we could be at least six months down the track in advancing the India and UK deals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Farrell spoke also about his work this morning in meeting with the trade ministers of the delegation from the EU—a bigger market we could not hope to deliver a trade deal with. I'm very pleased that the negotiations are no longer being done by those opposite but by Minister Farrell, who will act in the national interest. I know that he'll do everything he can to diminish the partisan nature of the sort of question that we had today. Bipartisanship in these matters is absolutely critical for the success of this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of Australia and our free trade, we do need to have a continuing growth of arrangements put into force. At the moment, we've got 16 free trade agreements in force, and I think we can do much better than that as a Labor government who's willing to talk to the key participants and who's willing to show up in this place, do the work here in the parliament and the work in the sessions in between, where we reach out and we work with business, we work with integrity with our partners across the world, to make sure that we get the very best possible outcomes—not just for agriculture but for entire sectors, right across the Australian economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it's critical that trade deals with Asia are further enhanced. I have confidence, once again, in Senator Farrell to make sure that the necessary relationships to make those deals work, to make them stick and to enhance them to the benefit of this nation, will be undertaken—65.2 per cent of Australia's two-way trade is with Asian countries. The fact that China was a major partner of trade worth $251.1 billion—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I would like to support the contribution and the motion moved by my friend Senator Colbeck. There is a fascinating fact that I want people to know about. It's a fun fact for kids up there in the gallery to take home and tell mum and dad and ask, 'Did you know this?' When it comes to free trade, how many free trade agreements were signed by the Labor Party when they were last in government? How many were signed? Show us your fingers. How many do you think were signed, school students? I'll tell you how many were signed. It wasn't five, it wasn't four, it wasn't seven, it was zero—a big, fat zero. It was a big, fat, ugly zero. That's how many free trade agreements were signed by the Labor Party when they were last in power. That's just a terrible record when it comes to free trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue with the Labor Party is that there's a word in free trade that they don't like, and that is 'free'. The Labor Party don't like freedom. They don't like the fact that businesses can get out there and make a buck. They don't like the fact that businesses can get out there, make some money, employ some people and grow the economy. We all like Senator Farrell, but, when he was talking about free trade agreements, he made a Freudian slip. It was a classic Freudian slip because he wasn't talking about negotiating a free trade agreement: it was about negotiating an enterprise agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see here is the mindset of the modern Labor Party, which is driven by the union movement. The union movement was the biggest handbrake on the development, signing and ratification of any of the free trade agreements that the previous coalition government signed. We signed free trade agreements with countries all over the world because—guess what?—Australia is an island. We're a trading nation. In Australia we make, produce and manufacture enough food to feed our population plus another 50 million people. We grow enough food in this country for 75 million people, so we need to make sure that food, for those 50 million people, doesn't sit in the warehouses and the paddocks but gets off this country—whether it's via plane, boat or slingshot; I don't care how it gets out of Australia—gets overseas and feeds people overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to raise it, but we should also remember that the Labor Party is the party who, when last in power, not only did not sign a single free trade agreement but also cut off a country's main supply of protein. A previous senator in this place—the agriculture minister Joe Ludwig—watched a program, and something happened upstairs in his brain, and he cut off the protein supply to Indonesia, one of our most important neighbours for trading and for geopolitical reasons. Because of a TV program, the Labor Party cut off the protein supply to that country. They not only did that but also devastated the cattle industry in Queensland and the Northern Territory. We won't take lessons from the Labor Party and their allies there in the Greens Party, who think food comes from the fridge and it's made by a magical mystery machine—</span>

                  </a>  What is interesting is that a member of the Labor Party has come to the defence of the Greens. We've got the coalition here—this excess of economic dunces. We've got the Greens, who think the money that runs this economy comes from a magical mystery money tree at the bottom of the garden, and then we've got the Labor Party, who thinks money just comes from, I don't know—brown paper bags, if you listen to the New South Wales Labor Party. And that's how you govern the country! Welcome to the new paradigm that is Australia. It is the Labor Party running a protection racket for this mob.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This mob over there don't know where food comes from. They think it comes from the fridge. Guess what? It comes from the farmers and graziers of Australia. What we saw in question time today was a failure of this government to stand up for the farmers and graziers of Australia—those who feed us, who will feed the Asia-Pacific and who will feed the world. What we've got to do, as Australia, is stand up for those who look after us, because without farmers, graziers and all those people in the towns and villages—people from places like where I come from on the Darling Downs—Australia starves. We need a government that stands up for them instead of a government who just—</span>

                  </a>  Well, I am talking him up because I know that Senator Farrell understands agriculture. I know that he understands agriculture, I know that he knows what we're doing and I know that he knows his portfolio area. So I'm happy to build you up as much as I can, Senator Farrell!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the point is, as Senator Farrell said earlier, that we will continue to do exactly what we said we would do in opposition: we will look after everybody in that supply chain of agriculture. We will do that. There are 16 free trade agreements in force and the Australian government—that's us, you guys; it's us now, not you!—recognises the importance of opening new trade opportunities for our agricultural industries, and we're working really hard with trading partners to do this. Senator Farrell said in his answer that he had met with the European ambassadors today. Great! That's so good. It's amazing that after two months we're off and running, whereas in the nine years—nearly 10 years—when you guys were in government you did bugger all! Bugger all! You did nothing!</span>

It's what leaders of countries and ministers of countries do to come to agreement. You might not understand that; we know your government had a different way of working.

In 2021, Australia's top three agricultural exports were wheat, beef and veal, and sheep meat. Senator Farrell is quite competent—more than competent—at being able to understand how free-trade agreements work. He's able to negotiate them and able to come to agreements with other countries—not to stop other countries wanting to deal with us in whatever way, shape or form that we were dealing with them, and not to have us embarrassed on the international stage. I don't think Senator Farrell will do any of that. But let me say that your government certainly didn't mind doing that.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  The coalition has an excellent track record on developing trade relationships and promoting Australia's interests. One in five Australian jobs is trade related, which is why getting our trading relationships right is so important for the Australian economy—an economy, mind you, which is hurting now more than ever, and the Labor Party do not seem to have the slightest idea what to do about it. However, let's get back to trade, as that's what this motion to take note of answers is about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the coalition was in government we implemented nine free trade agreements, from 2013—</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Hear, hear!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator VAN:</span>
                  </a>  I can list them for you, like Senator Birmingham can, if I have time at the end—lifting the share of trade covered by FTAs from 27 per cent under the previous Labor government to over 70 per cent now. That is what you call a commitment to promoting Australia's interests and supporting Australian jobs. What I question is Labor's commitment and ability to protect and promote our interests overseas. Let's look at that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Albanese recently visited Indonesia and said he wanted to strengthen ties between our two nations. I don't know what he said in those meetings, but it was only a couple of weeks later that President Widodo flew to China to meet with President Xi in Beijing. Clearly, what the Prime Minister was offering was not good enough. Compare that to when the coalition was in government. In February 2020, the same President of Indonesia visited Australia and addressed a joint sitting of parliament where he described Australia as 'Indonesia's closest friend'. We are simply not seeing that sort of commitment or effective engagement—despite Senator Farrell's little powwow this morning—by the Labor Party to support and develop our international trade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know Labor like to criticise the coalition government over our handling of the French submarine contract as a rebuttal to that point about how we handle international relations. However, let's not forget that Labor are on the record, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard,</span> stating that the French program was not keeping Australians safe. In Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade estimates, we heard Labor senators criticise that program over and over again. It was incessant. I won't name all the senators from that side who were doing it, but it was incessant. And, when we did do something about it which acted in the national interest, they criticised us for that. Unfortunately for you lot over there, you can't have it each way. In Senate estimates, Senator Wong—it's a shame she's not here—criticised the French submarine deal quite heavily herself. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's not keeping Australians safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we see that Labor's criticism of the submarine deal was just a form of cheap political pointscoring, which truly came at a cost to our national interest. And that's what has impacted the EU free trade agreement—nothing that we did when we were in government. The coalition government acted and took the necessary steps to keep Australia safe, and, out of that, the AUKUS agreement was born. Those in government now like to pretend that they would have handled it better; however, there is no truth to that, and it's on the record from Senate estimates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of the situation was that we recognised that the French were not delivering on the submarines, and, when Senator Reynolds was Minister for Defence, she initiated monthly phone calls to try and get the program back on track. When the French could still not deliver, we did what was best for Australia and our national security and made arrangements to acquire capability that would protect Australians. Those opposite would not have been able to accomplish such a feat. And we still worry that they're going to screw up the AUKUS agreement. They're making horrible noises about defence and how they're going to change it. A review from a previous defence minister has all the hallmarks of just shifting a few things around on the noticeboard. Let's see what they can actually do. So far it's clear to everyone that their record is far from stellar. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade and Tourism (Senator Farrell) to a question without notice he asked today relating to Mr Julian Assange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens will continue to call on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to just pick up the phone, call the UK and US governments and work to obtain Julian Assange's freedom. The answers given today by Senator Farrell on behalf of the Prime Minister lead to some very disturbing conclusions. The most disturbing conclusion is that it appears quiet diplomacy, at least so far as Senator Farrell has been briefed, amounts to very little, if any, diplomacy. And the very troubling conclusion we have from the government's answers in the Senate today is that their intention is to, so-called, bring this matter to a close but to bring it to a close by doing nothing to prevent the extradition of an Australian citizen, Julian Assange; by doing nothing to prevent his charging, his prosecution and his conviction in a US court; and by doing nothing to prevent him being sentenced for up to 175 years in jail, for the crime of telling the truth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Australian government to do nothing when that's the fate of an Australian citizen today—and whether or not you like Julian Assange, let's be clear to every Australian citizen that today the Australian government abandons Julian Assange, but tomorrow it might be your son or your brother or your father, or your daughter or your cousin or your friend. Once the Australian government sets the standard so low that they are willing to do nothing, nothing, when two of our closest allies between them are extraditing, persecuting, charging and potentially jailing for life an Australian citizen who did nothing other than expose the war crimes of the United States government, what will they do next? Who will they betray next? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is equally troubling is that we had a change of government here in Australia. We have gone from heavily conservative to notionally Labor. In the United States it's gone from Trumpian to the Biden administration. The 18 charges that Julian Assange is facing were all laid under the former Trump presidency by the US Department of Justice—18 charges brought by Donald Trump's administration against an Australian citizen, trying to put him in jail for 175 years for an alleged crime that never happened on US soil, that the US government has admitted never harmed a US citizen. All it did—but it was a powerful thing—was tell the truth about US war crimes and expose the evidence and the disclosures from former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that detailed appalling war crimes and human rights abuses committed by the US government. Julian's crime, if you can call it that, is telling the rest of the world the ugly truth about the war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The US seeks Julian's extradition from the UK, and, in that process itself, Julian's rights have been abused. He's now been held for three years in maximum security in Belmarsh Prison and, if convicted, faces effectively a death sentence. Yet the speaking notes given to Senator Farrell are that the Australian government is satisfied about Julian Assange's health and is satisfied that his health and welfare are being looked after in the system. How could you be satisfied? Three years in maximum security, potentially another lifetime in maximum security, when all of the evidence shows that Julian has seriously deteriorating health—evidence that was accepted by the UK courts, clearly accepted by the UK courts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is that his rapidly deteriorating health is actually due to the prolonged arbitrary detention. It amounts simply to torture. Indeed, the former UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Nils Melzer, has stated that Julian is a victim of ongoing psychological torture. That's not the Greens; it's not Julian's lawyers; it's the UN special rapporteur on torture who said that. UK magistrates and the high court have accepted expert testimony—it's not challenged—that, if extradition were to become imminent, Julian would have an irresistible urge to take his own life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Julian if you're listening: the movement is growing to free you. You have more friends than ever in this parliament to free you. It's about time that your government and your Prime Minister understood their obligation to Australian citizens.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I rise to speak on document No. 11: the unfortunate response of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to foot-and-mouth disease. He has been caught flat-footed since the disease became uncontrollable in Indonesia and spread to 22 provinces, including Bali, incredibly quickly. On 5 July we were notified of that. On 6 July industry was out on the front foot calling for foot baths and for action from this government as the catastrophic impact of foot-and-mouth disease was to be borne upon us. They wanted to see some action on 6 July. You know what? There wasn't much said by the minister. He was quite dismissive of beefing up our border response. It was on 12 July that he made those infamous comments, the comments that absolutely offended our farmers. He basically said: 'You know what? We're not going to rush to get the foot baths in, guys. They've got chemicals in them'—like citric acid!—'People coming back from Bali are usually wearing thongs. We don't want to hurt their feet. We don't want to have to put them through this.' That's a synopsis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about farmers' response to this government's flat-footed response, no wonder they were concerned when they heard their own agriculture minister saying: 'You know what? We're more worried about people wearing thongs back from Bali and long queues at airports than we are about ensuring this catastrophic disease does not get into our farms.' So the opposition rightly called for the government to get the foot mats into our airports, to make sure they're talking to everybody who's come back from Bali to ask: 'Have you been on a farm?' 'Have you gone for a walk in a paddy field? You were probably technically on a farm and you need to be aware of the risk that you're bringing in.' Australians will do the right thing. But that's not what this government did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stood up in this place and we asked genuine questions because we do want them to succeed on this. We want them to stop foot-and-mouth disease at the border. We also have a responsibility to hold them to account. Thanks to our pressure, and the sensible conversations that industry has been having, they suddenly went from dismissive to defensive. So, this last sitting fortnight, we have seen the minister for agriculture turn to personal attacks—blaming the opposition instead of actually answering simple questions: What did you know? Why did it take you so long? How many Australians coming back from Bali since we knew, on 5 July, actually went across foot mats? He told us it was 100 per cent. It turns out that the foot mats weren't anywhere near our airports and our returning passengers until Monday/Tuesday last week, when we can confidently say they were installed in airports. So it was too little, too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about banning food products? If you talk to experts, the biggest risk of foot-and-mouth, and the way it occurred in the UK, is it coming in from imported products and getting into our food supply chain. In New Zealand, another country that's so special, like Australia, and that doesn't have foot-and-mouth disease on its shores, and where agriculture is incredibly important to its economic future, they've banned the importation of food products from foot-and-mouth hotspots. That's smart. We're an island; we can do this. We also need to scan every bit of luggage coming in from these countries so that we know if there's food product in there and can hold it. We need to make sure we're helping Indonesia by giving them the technology we have, to ensure that something's not coming on board. These are the very real questions that, as an opposition, we've been asking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's response today and yesterday was appalling—that because we haven't tweeted about it, the opposition doesn't care. I'm sorry, but I can talk to you ad nauseum about the farmers that have contacted my office, and me personally, since this outbreak. They're incredibly concerned. Just because senators haven't tweeted about it doesn't mean it's not an issue. It just shows how immature and unready for the responsibilities of government they are. This is a serious issue. Thank goodness the Prime Minister has had to step in over this hapless fool. He is taking responsibility and putting this on the agenda at national cabinet, because the states are critical in our response to this. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report exposed yet again the crisis of unpaid superannuation in this country. On the watch of those opposite, Australian workers have lost $5 billion per year and stolen super. That is $5 billion missing from the retirement savings of Australian workers because those opposite sat back and allowed the Australian Taxation Office to take a light-touch approach to dodgy employers. This light-touch approach has done nothing to stop employers stealing super from their workers and has resulted in less than 15 per cent of unpaid super being recovered by the tax office. The Auditor-General found that the ATO's failure to proactively enforce superannuation compliance meant that it was workers themselves who were relied on to do all the heavy lifting, with the largest proportion of recovered superannuation resulting from workers themselves reporting a problem to the ATO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen what happens when workers make the decision to report their underpayments to the ATO. They receive no or completely inadequate communication. They are still likely to have to fight for months or years to be paid what they are owed, and their employers aren't even slightly deterred from doing it all again to the next worker. Earlier this year the Senate Economics References Committee heard from a group of early childhood educators and members of the United Workers Union who had had over $82,000 stolen from their retirement savings by their employer. These workers, with their union, did everything right. They reached out to their employer, to no avail. They contacted the ATO, to no avail. And still, over two years after reporting the theft of their super, they have not received a single cent. One worker told me: 'I feel betrayed by my employer and failed by the ATO for allowing this to happen for such a long time.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Super theft totals over $5 billion every year, affecting almost a quarter of the entire workforce and leaving workers to retire with smaller retirement savings forcing more people onto the aged pension and racking up a future bill for all taxpayers. But those opposite don't see it that way. Those opposite gladly sat back for almost a decade while employers stole their workers' super to get ahead, allowing their departments to believe that employers that stole super were just making what was called 'pragmatic business choices'. Now they've gone straight after workers' retirement savings themselves. Their seats on the opposition benches weren't even warm before they started their attack on our superannuation system. Opposition members have said government should not proceed with the legislated increase to superannuation. They called super 'a massive drain on the economy'. They suggested that the government increase taxes on superannuation. They've called for the requirement for employers to pay super to be removed altogether. They have called for super not to be paid to low-income earners. Those opposite are completely out of control and out of touch when it comes to super. They have never supported our superannuation system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government knows that superannuation is one of the greatest strengths of our economy. Our universal workplace right to financial dignity in retirement is unique to our country, and it is the envy of the world. I was proud earlier today to be elected as the chair of the Senate economics committee. In this role, I look forward to delivering our government's plan for an economy that works for people, not the other way around. That plan includes strengthening our superannuation system; making sure super is paid to workers, preferably at the same time as their wages; ensuring that the ATO can and does crackdown on dodgy employers with urgency and with force; getting the super guarantee to 12 per cent and, once it does, looking at whether and when we should aim for 15 per cent; and finding the best way to make super payable on unpaid parental leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation is a Labor government legacy, and we will always stand with workers to protect and strengthen it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  I rise to take note of the Foreign Interference through Social Media Select Committee progress report. In December 2021, the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media handed down its first interim report, and I want to commend the work of its chair in the previous parliament, Senator McAllister, and the deputy chair, Senator Molan, for the work of the committee. In the interim report the committee recognised the risk of platforms being used to spread misinformation and disinformation, and recommended that a single body should be established that is dedicated to keeping social media platforms and other government entities accountable in preventing cyber-enabled foreign interference. The committee said the need for an entity would continue to grow in importance as the use of the cyber-enabled technologies to interfere in foreign elections and referendums had increased significantly in recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also issued a further progress report in April 2022. In that report, it noted that it had not yet completed its work, nor its final inquiry report, as it had intended, due to the parliament proroguing the committee. The chair, Senator McAllister, made a recommendation that the Senate consider re-establishing the committee in this new parliament. I want to add my support to that call from Senator McAllister in the previous parliament. I agree that there is important work for this Senate select committee to continue to do in this parliament. I hope that the Senate does agree to re-establish it. I note for the record that in the previous parliament it was chaired by an opposition senator and that the deputy chair was a government senator. I hope that if the Senate agrees to re-establish it that it should again be chaired by an opposition senator, with the deputy chair being from the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The particular reason why I think it is necessary for this committee to continue is that there have been significant developments in this space since the committee handed down its interim report, which it acknowledged was not complete. That's particularly in relation to one social media company, TikTok, which made a submission, appeared before the committee and gave evidence to it. In its submission, and in its appearance before the committee, TikTok assured the parliament and, through the parliament, the Australian people, that the data of Australian users on their platform was safe because it was ultimately stored in the United States and Singapore. What they did not highlight was that that data, although it was stored in the United States and Singapore, is accessible in mainland China and had been repeatedly accessed in mainland China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We only know about this now because of a leaked report from a whistleblower to BuzzFeed News which exposed this practice on 17 June. Following that, I wrote to TikTok Australia to seek clarification about their evidence before the committee, and to ask them whether or not this practice which had been identified by BuzzFeed in the United States had also taken place in Australia. I did so on 3 July. They replied to my letter on 12 July, acknowledging that, yes, it is the case that Australian TikTok user data is accessible in mainland China. This is important because all Chinese companies and individuals are subject to a whole suite of national security legislation in China, in particular the 2017 National Intelligence Law, which requires all entities and individuals to cooperate with China's intelligence agencies in the national interest, if required, and to keep that cooperation secret. So it does raise concerns that it's possible that Australian user data has fallen already, or could fall in the future, into the hands of the Chinese government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the cybersecurity minister, Ms O'Neil, on 13 July, encouraging her to take up all possible regulatory options in addressing the problem. And in more recent days we've had reports from the cybersecurity company Internet 2.0 which demonstrates the enormous breadth of data collected by this app. We've had a recognition by the independent Australian Information Commissioner that this is a serious issue which they will investigate in relation to TikTok. And just this morning, Max Mason of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, who has followed this issue particularly closely, reported that members of parliament have been warned that they need to have a second phone if they are using social media apps like TikTok. This follows reports in recent days from New Zealand that its MPs have been warned not to use TikTok on their personal accounts. So I'd like to see the government investigate all the regulatory options. The opposition stands ready to support the government, should they propose any proactive steps to protect the seven million Australian users of TikTok.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it is time that the parliament considers re-establishing the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, as recommended by the now assistant minister, Senator McAllister. I look forward to working with all members in the chamber to ensure these important cybersecurity and privacy issues are dealt with. Unfortunately, so far all we have had from the government is a comment by the minister that she is concerned about these developments and she hopes other Australians are also concerned. It is not the job of the minister simply to be a commentator; it is the job of the minister to take action. I hope they take action on this very serious national security issue.</span>

                  <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  At the request of Senator Hanson-Young and pursuant to notice, I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate agrees that corporate super profits taxes could offset the cost of providing cost-of-living relief, including the provision of free childcare, truly free public education, abolishing student debt and putting dental and mental health into Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise on behalf of the Greens to speak to this really important question of choices. We have a government that's crying poor and that's warning us of impending cuts and an austerity budget come October, and yet it is refusing to raise much-needed revenue that could be used to address the cost-of-living crisis. It is persisting with Mr Morrison's stage 3 tax cuts for the very wealthy, which would of course benefit men more than women and would deliver an approximately $9,000 tax cut to the likes of Mr Clive Palmer, who doesn't need the help in that regard, although he certainly needs help in other ways. This government is persisting in wasting money in giving tax cuts to people who don't need the help, at the same time saying to Australians: 'No, we can't afford to increase JobSeeker. No, we can't afford to make child care free. No, we can't afford to put dental or mental health care into Medicare.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it's bollocks. It's nonsense. People expect better from this new government. We are in a cost crisis on top of the climate crisis that we are in, and people expect the government, rather than throwing its hands up and pointing its finger at the RBA, seemingly not able to do anything about it, to take action and deliver cost-of-living relief for them, not tax cuts to the very wealthy, who don't need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's our first bone of contention: $244 billion over a decade for the stage 3 tax cuts. That could be used to make child care genuinely free. Never mind the CCR and CCB rebates that currently exist and that are incredibly complicated and a disincentive for people to work them out in the first place. We could actually make it free. That's what we had in the pandemic. People know it can be done. It really helped. Yet this government isn't proposing to do that. They should be, and they're not. While they're at it, they should be paying early childhood educators a decent wage, for that matter, and that's something we'll keep pushing for as well. Those stage 3 tax cuts could fund free child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those tax cuts could also fund putting dental care and mental health care into Medicare. We have a universal healthcare system, yet it doesn't cover your teeth or your brain. The last time I checked, your teeth and your brain are part of your body. You should be able to go to a dentist. You should be able to go to a mental health care specialist and get the help you need when you need it, using your Medicare card. That's what universal healthcare provision is about. I think that's why we pay taxes—so we can have those services provided to us as citizens of this wealthy nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We took many of these proposals to the election, so of course as a budget integrity measure we asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to cost them. We think it's important than when you make a promise as to how you can improve people's lives you show how you can raise the revenue to pay for it. So we've done that, and we have all the figures, and I'll bedazzle you with them now. Free child care, which I mentioned, is about $9 billion a year. It's quite a big spend. But it enables women to return to the workforce, which pays economic dividends beyond the amount it costs and which is the right thing to do. If you want women's workforce participation to increase and if you want real equality in the workplace as well as in the home—which is something we're also pushing for—then make child care free. It is good for the kids. They get fantastic-quality early childhood education, and we know that at that stage of their development that early input is crucial and really sets kids up to be good learners as they go through the schooling system. And it's good for the parents. It's good for our economy. It's good for gender equality. Let's make child care free and let's pay early childhood workers the wage they deserve for the crucial role they play in educating the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We campaigned on free public education and making university and TAFE free like it used to be, like many of the people in this chamber received. And I'm making sure that public schools could be fully funded. That would cost about $5½ billion every year. Again, these are quite substantial figures. But, importantly, we can pay for them by axing those stage 3 tax cuts for the very wealthy, who don't need the help. We could pay for them in myriad other ways. A corporate superprofits tax is another excellent revenue-raising measure. And the proposal we put to the election that the Parliamentary Budget Office costed would raise $286 billion over 10 years. That's what the Parliamentary Budget Office has costed for our corporate superprofits tax. That could fund the provision of dental care and mental health care through Medicare, which would cost only about a third of that, and that could cover the cost of making child care free.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the decisions governments make. It's very interesting to see who this government is making wait for help and who it's prepared to hand out money to, hand over fist, without any questions asked. They're making people wait for free child care. It's not their policy, although it's something they have said they might consider in future terms if they're re-elected. Why wait? It should be a principal commitment, and you could actually fund it if you raised the revenue by axing those stage 3 tax cuts and by placing a corporate superprofits tax on some of our very wealthy corporations, who are increasing their wealth—during a pandemic—at record rates. In fact, figures released earlier this week show that the share of corporate profits is the largest it's been in 70 years. Corporate profits are at a 70-year record high, while we're in a cost-of-living crisis! The inequity of that and the widening gap between ordinary citizens and big corporations and billionaires is obscene. It cannot stand. So let's raise that revenue by making those big corporations and billionaires pay their fair share so that we can provide the services that people need and rely on, the services that should be provided in a wealthy nation like ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a few other suggestions for revenue raising. We're in a climate crisis as well as a cost-of-living crisis, and yet this government—and the last, for that matter—paid out $11 billion every year in cheap fuel and accelerated depreciation to fossil fuel companies. We call them fossil fuel subsidies: freebies and perks that other people don't get. That's $11 billion a year; in fact, over the decade, it's $117 billion. These companies are making record profits and paying zero tax. One in three of them pays no tax. So they're not only getting $117 billion in free public money; they're also doing us the lovely favour of cooking our climate even more. This government, in our name, is paying these fossil fuel companies to pollute and make the climate crisis worse as the inequality crisis is worsening. It makes no sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance have said they'll look for savings. Cut those fossil fuel subsidies. There's $117 billion over 10 years going to big companies who don't need the help. Their bottom lines are very healthy indeed. They shouldn't be getting help to pollute this beautiful planet when we are in a climate crisis; when we should be transitioning to clean, renewable energy that will create jobs and not make the problem worse. Cancel those fossil fuel subsidies. Have a corporate superprofits tax. Axe those stage 3 tax cuts. These revenue-raising measures could allow government to address the cost-of-living crisis within our budgetary means. Increase JobSeeker so that people below the poverty line don't have to choose between paying their rent and getting their kids a school uniform, between paying the rent and having some fresh vegetables on the plate at dinner time. These are the choices that people are making because this government, and the last, wasted so much money by giving it to fossil fuel companies and proposing to give it to the very wealthy with those stage 3 tax cuts that kick in in a year or so. Yet the government is crying poor and saying how broke it is. Adopt these revenue-raising proposals that can achieve multiple objectives by actually servicing the community and not making the climate crisis worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't stand alone in these suggestions. In fact, just yesterday the UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres, said that governments should be taxing excessive oil and gas profits. That was music to our ears because that's what we've proposed for many a year. These concepts are becoming normalised and socialised, and many, many countries and leaders are calling for it. Mr Guterres says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is immoral for oil and gas companies to be making record profits from this energy crisis on the backs of the poorest people and communities and at a massive cost to the climate …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He also says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… this grotesque greed is punishing the poorest and most vulnerable people, while destroying our only common home …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Mr Guterres's proposal—one that the Greens took to the last election—is that we tax the superprofits of oil and gas and coal companies. It is obscene that those companies are making record profits when we're in an inequality crisis; it is obscene that public money is being used to fuel their profits, which are worsening the climate crisis; and it is obscene that this government says it's broke and can't do anything about it. That is not at all what people voted for, and they expect this parliament to deliver for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention housing as one of the other things that is contributing to a real squeeze in people's cost of living and skyrocketing rates of homelessness. We know now that almost 450,000 women over the age of 45 are on the brink of homelessness. Women in that age bracket are the fastest growing cohort of people without a home. We know that young people have given up on the idea of ever buying their own home. They're now facing a rental increase that they can't cope with either. This is a serious problem. Rather than raise the revenue in the ways I just outlined, by making big businesses and billionaires pay their fair share, the government is crying poor and proposing only a scintilla of new build social homes. I think they're proposing 30,000 homes. Of course that's better than nothing, but it is nowhere near what the scale of the problem requires. We took to the election a plan to build a million homes over 20 years. That would wipe the social housing waiting list, which is 50,000 people in my home state of Queensland, and, of course, far greater across the whole nation. We could wipe that homelessness list, and we could build beautifully designed and climatically appropriate homes that are accessible for people of all sorts of different abilities, and that are cheap to run because they're powered by renewable energy. That would mean that no-one in this country would go without a roof over their head.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't cry poor when it's giving away $224 billion to people that don't need the help, when it's giving away $117 billion to big coal and gas companies to make the climate crisis worse. It can't say that it doesn't have enough money to fix homelessness and the housing crisis—and that's not even to mention changing those negative-gearing and capital gains tax settings, which Labor used to have the guts to talk about. Sadly, it seems to have lost all spine in the last election and didn't dare mention it. We're proudly saying we think those perks should be phased out. They are worsening the housing crisis. They are inflating the bubble. They are making it harder for people to own their first home. How dare taxpayer money be used to subsidise the profits of people who are accumulating more homes than they will ever need when some people don't have any at all! How dare our taxpayer money be used for that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we could address homelessness. We could make child care free. We could put dental and mental health care into Medicare. We could make university and TAFE free again. We could do these things if we raised the revenue by making those big corporations pay their fair share; by not giving those free billions to fossil fuel companies, which are cooking the planet anyway and not paying tax; and by cancelling those stage 3 tax cuts, which are going to the wealthy, who don't need the help. The budget is about choices, and governing is about delivering for the community. It's not about delivering for the people that make political donations to your re-election campaigns. And I will be urging the government, as will all of my party members, to think about these choices as the first budget gets closer and closer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296331" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GROGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I also rise to speak on this motion from Senator Hanson-Young. The Australian economy is still growing. We know that we've got significant challenges out there. The economy is still growing. We read every single day in the paper that high inflation is impacting people all across the country. The most recent number is 6.1. Now, obviously, the result of that is significantly increasing interest rates, and that has an impact on every single person across our country. One full per cent between June and July: that's huge when that gets applied to every good and service that people are interfacing with. We know this, and we know that the Reserve Bank has been clear that there's more to come. So, yes, we need to do something. We need a plan. There needs to be things done to make it easier on the people across our country to cope with this economic scenario. These rate rises hurt every single person—their mortgages. The numbers were quoted in this house earlier today and yesterday, and no doubt will be quoted again and again as they keep increasing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The causes of this inflation are primarily, but not exclusively, global. We've inherited nine years of mess, nine years of debt—debt to the tune of a trillion dollars—and there's nothing to show for it. In nine years, there were opportunities to pursue renewable innovation: things that would have strengthened our country, that would have made us more prepared for an economic downturn and that would have made us better prepared for global influence—things that we cannot influence terribly well when they happen but which we can prepare for. We could have built a stronger economy, but we didn't do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, when they were in government, wasted nine long years. They left workers worse off, in particular. The former finance minister Mathias Cormann said that they were intentionally making workers worse off by making low wages 'a deliberate design feature' of the Australian economy. Now, that was a shameful thing to do. It is a shameful thing that has been done to the workers in this country—the workers who have contributed, who work hard to try and put food on the table and pay their rent or pay their mortgage. They've just been so totally disrespected over the last nine long years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition left us in an economic mess, through a decade of domestic failure on skills, on supply chains and on energy. In the skills area, they just gutted some of our excellent training facilities and our whole system of building the next generation of young people trained in the skills of the future, trained for the jobs of the future, as our skills mix changes as industries change. Nothing has been done to prepare for that, which is a disgrace. We now have a skills shortage that we didn't need to have. Some foresight, some planning, would have addressed that. But, no—we did not see that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we do have a plan to tackle these issues. The Albanese government has a plan to tackle the economic crisis that was left to us by those opposite, and the Australian people endorsed that plan in May at the election. As the Treasurer laid out earlier, we have a convergence of challenges facing us the likes of which comes around once in a generation. It's a once-in-a-generation challenge that represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity. We have an opportunity, and we're going to take it. It's the opportunity to build a better future: to make sure that people can get good, solid, well-paying jobs that are sustainable, so that they can see a future and are not grappling from day to day, from month to month—so that they actually can look with hope towards the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan started very early on with us ensuring that the lowest-paid workers in our economy got a pay rise of 5.2 per cent. Now, it's not enough, but that is a huge leap forward and the first time in a long time that those people have had any sort of sense of hope about where their wages are going—that they are not constantly going backwards but are starting to catch up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The audit of rorts and waste that's being conducted by the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer is going to go through that budget from March, line by line, and unpack all of the waste and all of the terrible decisions that were made that do nothing to build our country—nothing. We will ensure that spending is focused clearly on building value and building a better future and is not spent on buying votes or giving money to your mates. That's not how we are going to behave. That is not how we intend to manage our budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, importantly, we have a plan to lift the speed limit on the economy and stop the decade of stagnation that we've seen. Firstly, we will help everyone with the cost of living by doing a couple of key things. Now, child care is obviously a critical issue. People's ability to go to work is impacted significantly by the child care that they can find and the child care that they can afford. So one of the things we will be doing is cutting the cost of child care for 1.2 million families so that they can work out their family budget, have the children in child care, know that they can afford it, go and build their careers, and engage in some of the great training opportunities that we will be bringing forward—so that they can build a future for their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also cutting the cost of medicine by $12.50 a script. Medicine is a really important aspect of people's budgets, and we know that, when faced with a choice about what they're going to drop when there isn't enough money to put food on the table, pay the rent and pay the bills, people will often drop their medication, which means that their health is significantly impacted and sometimes spirals into more serious health problems. So cutting the cost of medicine will address that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll ensure that wages grow over time by supporting decent wages in the care economy and by investing in the industries that are going to deliver secure and well-paid jobs. We'll invest in the skills necessary. We'll be working with business and with unions to ensure that businesses can hire the people they need and that Australians are trained for these new industries that are coming forward, for the opportunities that we really clearly see—opportunities in renewable energy, obviously. Certainly, in my home state of South Australia, we're all very excited about the hydrogen future that may be available to us, and there's an awful lot of work going on there that we're very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also going to fix our supply chains and deal with the supply side of an inflation challenge by investing in cleaner, cheaper, more reliable energy. And, as I've said a couple of times this week in this chamber, our plan for our energy grid, our plan for renewables and our plan to lower the cost of energy for households are all on foot. These things are going to make a big difference. They're not only going to create jobs; they're not only going to put us on the map in terms of innovation; they're also going to deliver solid future jobs, well-paid jobs, for people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to tax reform, our priority, our significant priority at the moment, will be to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax here in Australia. Multinational companies operating across borders are far too able to shift their profits to low- or no-tax jurisdictions to avoid paying tax in countries like Australia. These practices have become more sophisticated, as companies use intangible assets such as intellectual property and hold them in low-tax jurisdictions. The rapid growth of the digital economy has completely exacerbated this issue. As the Treasurer referred to earlier today, one of the key things that we'll be doing is supporting the OECD's two-pillar solution of a global 15 per cent minimum tax to ensure that some of the profits of the largest multinationals, particularly digital firms, are taxed where the products or services are sold. This is going to assist with our budget repair, and it will help level the playing field for Australian businesses, who are far too often negatively impacted because a multinational or an overseas based company can do exactly this and Australian companies are not able to—nor should they want to. We should be paying our taxes and we should be proudly paying our taxes. But our taxes should not be creating an extra burden on legitimate business activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have an economic plan, and it's clear, it's deliberate and it's a direct response to the challenges left to us by those opposite—a wasted decade, almost, of coalition governments. Labor's five-point economic plan is calibrated to reduce cost of living, drive productivity growth and expand the capacity of the economy to alleviate supply-side pressures. We will get wages growing so Australians aren't held back or left behind, as I've said, and invest our public money in a way that delivers genuine economic value for Australians. These are the critical points in our economic plan that we will deliver on and will make a difference, and we will do it with transparency and we will do it in conversation and in partnership with businesses, the unions and the community. This is all of us working together. That is what we will deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we won't be supporting this motion. We've been upfront about the growing challenges facing our economy, including high and rising inflation, rising interest rates, skyrocketing cost of living and $1 trillion of debt. These challenges have been exacerbated by nearly a decade of wasted opportunities and wrong priorities by those opposite. Our economic plan, as I say, is a very deliberate, direct response to the growing pressures we have been left with. We will continue working hard to provide responsible and permanent cost-of-living relief. These things will be laid out fully in our budget in October as we work through the March budget, find the savings, redirect the money and start to look at how we can improve the lives of people across this country. Our priority, as I said, in tax will be the multinationals. We will work very hard with our international partners and right here at home to deliver on those promises and deliver those savings which we can then turn into opportunities for Australians—opportunities to address our cost-of-living pressures.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  Before I move to address the substance of the motion, I want to take this opportunity to respond to some of the points raised by Senator Grogan. At the outset I should say I think it's a good thing that Senator Grogan is not supporting a super company profits tax; I think that's a responsible thing for a member of one of the two governing parties in this country to adopt. I commend her in relation to that. But there were two points I think I should rebut in my contribution to this place. The first is the statement that there is nothing to show in terms of the government debt that was incurred during the last term of parliament. The reality is—and the Australian public knows this all too well—that Australia faced the biggest pandemic crisis this nation has ever faced for decades and decades and decades. I'm sure Senator Grogan has met, as I have met, as all senators in this place have met, small businesses, large businesses and, most importantly, employees of those businesses who were kept employed because of the previous government's JobKeeper program. It was absolutely essential in terms of keeping the connection between those employees and their businesses. I'm proud that I served in a government that adopted that as a policy. So it is not correct to say that there was nothing to show for the debt. There were great things to show for the debt, including the fact this country achieved record levels of employment not seen for decades in the aftermath of the major impacts of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I wish to raise—this is a point I will be returning to constantly over this term of parliament—is this concept that there's all this low-hanging fruit waiting to be plucked in terms of addressing tax avoidance measures to be mobilised against international multinationals. This shows a lack of knowledge of the measures which have been taken by the Australian Taxation Office over a number of years. The ATO has brought a number of cases addressing this exact issue. All of the low-hanging fruit has been plucked. There is no more low-hanging fruit in this space. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suggest to Senator Grogan that she attends estimates, when, no doubt, Commissioner Jordan and his team from the ATO will be present, and they will advise you of the magnitude of tax which has been identified—in particular, potential future deductions for loan interest repayments that have been identified as not being legitimate. It runs into the billions of dollars. The ATO has already gone through, with a fine-toothed comb, the largest multinationals and largest companies in this country with respect to those exact issues which you legitimately refer to. But the concept that there's this magic money tree which you're going to be able to go to and pluck the dollars off in this regard is totally misconceived. People listening to this broadcast don't have to believe me; they can look at the results in the next three years. The low-hanging fruit in terms of international transfer pricing has all been picked from the trees. There is no more. I've got a great deal of confidence in the ATO and the work they've done in that regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Grogan also mentioned the OECD's project with respect to the minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent. She's right to refer to that. That's an appropriate segue for me to then move to the Greens supposedly fully funded and fully costed corporate super profits tax. I interjected, in a disorderly way, during Senator Waters's speech in relation to whether or not she would refer to the Parliamentary Budget Office costings. I note Senator Waters did not refer to the detail. I've got the detail here. In fact, I've got 500 pages of detail with respect to the costings of the Greens policies. I've got 500 pages of it, Senator Waters. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe in truth in political advertising. It's something which I have advocated for over many, many years. In that respect, I believe that if, as the Greens policy says, something is fully costed and fully funded, you should be able to take that on face value and believe it. You should be able to take that on face value and believe that it is fully costed and fully funded. But the reality is that, when you look at the PBO's costings, that is not the case. This isn't my analysis, this isn't Senator Scarr's analysis—this is the PBO's analysis. Let's read what they say. This is in the PBO's summary on page 1 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2022 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lection </span><span style="font-style:italic;">commitment</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> re</span><span style="font-style:italic;">port</span> of July 2022:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens' platform, if fully implemented, would be expected to result in larger deficits …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do larger deficits equate to 'fully costed and fully funded'? Fully funded by debt? I don't think people reading the Greens policy statement would assume that, when they said 'fully funded', they actually meant 'fully funded by debt', but this is the result. The report states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the PBO says in their own costings. That does not equate to fully costed and fully funded. You shouldn't have higher deficits if it's fully funded. That's a simple proposition. You don't need a PhD in economics to work that out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you move to page 3 of the PBO's <span style="font-style:italic;">2022 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lection commitments report</span> with respect to the Greens 'fully funded, fully costed' policies, and you see the result of the 'fully funded, fully costed' policies. What's it going to lead to? Table 1 on page 3 is headed 'Financial implications of election commitments by party, 2022-23 forward estimates underlying cash, headline cash and fiscal balance basis ($billion)'. Under the Greens, they all go backwards. Each one of them goes backwards.</span>

                  </a>  Greater deficits does not equal 'fully costed and fully funded'. No, Senator Steele-John, this is what the PBO is saying, not me. This is the PBO. In terms of the headline cash balance, this is what they say about the Australian Greens policies. The net impact of coalition election commitments is a positive $1.1 billion. The net impact of the Australian Labor Party's election commitments—headline cash balance—in that period, through the 2022-23 forward estimates, is negative $40.5 billion. The net impact of Greens election commitments is negative 112.1 billion Australian dollars—$112.1 billion! No wonder you didn't mention it, Senator Waters, in your contribution on this debate. That's out of the PBO's work, not mine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's see what the PBO says about the super profits proposition. I am pleased that those opposite in government are not supporting this resolution.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I used to be company secretary and general counsel of an ASX listed company. If I put something out into the market and said it was totally costed and fully funded—when you've got $112 billion of community deficits, you've got the PBO talking about a high degree of uncertainty, and there's no safety warning in terms of the Greens' policy document—ASIC would be all over me like a rash. That's why we need truth in political advertising. The PBO says there is a very high degree of uncertainty associated with this costing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the other thing they say. This is a point which leads on to other observations:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Super-profits tax paid would be reduced by 20% to account for an estimated behavioural response by companies …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because do you know what happens when you increase taxes? The people who are investing in capital in this country, which provides jobs to Australians and provides markets to small businesses all over this country, consider their options. They consider their options. Can I tell you that in my previous role in the mining industry, one of my roles was to look at different jurisdictions and whether or not our company should invest in them. One of the things we looked at was the corporate tax rate. Companies have options. They don't have to invest here. They can invest in other countries.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those in the Greens should consider—and I'm happy to lend it to them—what I'm going to quote from a book I've got, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Basic Economics</span>. It's economics 101. I'll buy you all a copy. This is what it says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">that tax revenues will also rise by 10 percent. But in fact more people may move out of a heavily taxed jurisdiction, or buy less of a heavily taxed commodity, so that the revenues received can be disappointingly far below what was estimated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funny, that! People actually respond to higher tax rates. They'll invest in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This has been the economic experience all over the world, from the United States to India to Iceland. I'll quote again from the text:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the 18 per cent is higher than the OECD minimal amount which has been negotiated—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened to tax revenues? Did they fall? Did they fall proportionately when the tax rate went down from 45 per cent to 18 per cent? Is that what happened? No, they tripled. The tax revenues—which are paying for schools, for hospitals, for roads, for the mental health care which you talk about and which I care passionately about, and for dental care—tripled. The tax rates came down and the revenues tripled. That's the experience. That's basic economics—economics 101.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a deeper issue here, and it is an issue for a centre-right party such as mine and, indeed, for the Australian Labor Party. The deeper issue is this. When we go to elections and the Greens falsely and fraudulently claim that their policies were fully funded and fully costed—when that isn't the case because, if it were the case, you wouldn't have increasing deficits—they are saying to voters at the polling booths: 'You will get free dental care. You will get free mental health care. You will get free child care.' And, on the face of it, this sounds good. It's very tempting, but there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. The only question is: who pays? The introduction of a corporate super tax would drive investment offshore and drive jobs offshore, and people who were considering whether or not they should invest in Australia would take their money somewhere else, invest it there, and provide jobs and prosperity overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that both my party and the Australian Labor Party need to shine a brighter light on the ridiculous, fanciful Greens policies and the potentially disastrous economic consequences for this country.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298839" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ALLMAN-PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  Australians are facing a cost-of-living crisis which may well have gone unnoticed by those across the chamber. This is a crisis that was not of the Australian people's making, yet they are paying for it—literally—while megacorporations are seeing record profits from their price gouging. When we talk about there being no such thing as a free lunch, the groups in this country that are getting the free lunch are the big corporations and the mining companies, who are getting away with not paying their fair share of tax. When we talk about the question of who pays, we are talking about the Australian people who are not getting the services that they need and deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation is rising significantly faster than wages, and people are not keeping up. We've heard the Treasurer speak often about the pain that Australian households are facing, but so far he has failed to take action to meaningfully address rising prices for people in our community. The Reserve Bank of Australia's response to inflation has been to slug us with increases to the official cash rate, which is raising interest rates, which in turn are being passed on to people with mortgages and to renters—the people who can least afford it. Attempting to curb inflation by reducing the amount of money that first home buyers have for essentials is a particularly unjust policy tool. It's also doing nothing to address the true causes of inflation: shocks to supply and corporate profiteering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Massive corporations are using inflation as a fig leaf to cover up record levels of price-gouging and this corporate profiteering. The share of national income that is going to profit is at an all-time high. The share of national income that is going to workers is at an all-time low. This is why we need a tax on windfall profits—and we needed it yesterday. A combination of a tax on windfall profits, closing corporate tax loopholes and fixing the structural flaws in the way that the petroleum resource rent tax is calculated could deliver hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over the next decade. This would put a handbrake on corporate profits, which are currently skyrocketing, and could serve to meaningfully reduce inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been correctly identified across the chamber, the Greens took a policy of imposing corporate super profit taxes to the last election because we knew that the revenue from corporate tax could be used to make a real difference in people's lives. We knew that the government could use that money to reduce the cost of living for people in things like free child care. We saw during the early stages of the pandemic what a fundamental difference it made to people's household incomes when child care was made free. We've done it already; we need to do it again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is a huge portion of the household budget for so many families. In my first speech, I talked about the fact that I had to rely on the assistance of my mum to help me afford to go back to work, because of the high cost of child care. There are many women in our community who don't have the luxury and the privilege that I had of having family members or friends who can help them in that task. If we want women in this country to be able to fully participate in the workforce and to continue to engage in careers that they find meaningful and sustaining, and if we want their families to be able to afford for them to do that, we need to have fully universal free child care in this country. We can pay for it by taxing the big corporations and the miners, and making sure that they pay their fair share. It costs around $9 billion per year to provide fully free universal child care. That is much less than tax cuts that are being proposed. In addition to that, funding child care creates 20 times more jobs than tax cuts, dollar for dollar, according to the Australia Institute. That seems like a really sensible thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else could we do with the additional revenue that would be created if we taxed big corporations and billionaires and made them pay their fair share to ease the cost of living on families? We could make public education truly free. As I said in my first speech earlier this week, funding to private schools in the last decade has increased at five times the rate of public schools, and public schools are currently sitting at 91 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard. The Schooling Resource Standard is not an aspirational target; it is the minimum amount of funding that is required—the bare minimum—so that students can meet minimum benchmarks. And at the moment it's parents, carers, families and teachers who are making up the difference in that shortfall of funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents are having to pay ever-increasing fees in their public school. It is not unusual for a family to get an invoice at the start of the school year for anywhere between $500 and $3,000 for their public school, depending on where they live in the country. That money covers things like excursions, supplies in art classes and supplies in classes like industrial design and technology. And, increasingly, parents and carers are being asked to dig into their pockets to fund their children's public education. That places an increased burden on the cost-of-living pressures on families. By fully funding our public schools, not only do we give every child in this country the opportunity to have the best start in life but we also ease cost-of-living pressures on those families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked up until very recently in a public school. I have witnessed firsthand what cost-of-living pressures are doing to people in our communities. I have seen families who are struggling to put food on the table because their power costs are going up, the cost of rent is going up, the amount they're having to pay for their public school fees is going up, and they are skipping meals and their kids are going hungry. That should not be happening in a wealthy country like this. As I said the other day, one in eight people in my home state of Queensland are living in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the impacts of the decisions that get made in this place. When governments decide not to tax those who can afford to pay—when governments allow big corporations and billionaires not to pay their fair share—it is the people in our communities who suffer. It is the people in our communities who can't afford to put the petrol in the car to go to the job interview. It is the people in our communities who can't afford to pay their power bill this month. It is the people in our communities who can't afford to pay the rent. I'm pretty sure that the people back in our communities are expecting us to make decisions that will make their lives better. By taxing big corporations and billionaires and making them pay their fair share, we have the capacity to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could also use the revenue from taxing big corporations and billionaires to put dental and mental health into Medicare. We know that dozens of people in our communities put off going to the dentist because they can't afford it. It is not uncommon to hear of people putting off going to the dentist, then eventually going when they can no longer put it off and being told that they have to pay $6,000 for root canal treatment that they can't afford. Not including dental and mental health in Medicare is a false economy; we end up paying more in the long run when people's health needs are not addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens went to this election with a plan to introduce a corporate super profits tax, to tax billionaires, to tax the mining companies and to get them to pay their fair share. And what we heard, when we spoke to people in the community, was that they want that too. They want to be able to afford health care. They want to be able to afford to keep a roof over their head. They want to be able to afford to send their kids to school with the things that they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve to have what they need to live a good life. People on JobSeeker deserve to have that doubled. If we make big corporations and billionaires pay their fair share, we can do that. We saw what a massive impact that had on so many people's lives during the pandemic. Health appointments that had been put off were made. Children who needed clothes for winter were able to get them. Students who hadn't been on school excursions for months were able to go on them. People were able to live a dignified, good life because they had what they needed. And that is the job of government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues and I stand for making sure that the people in this country who can afford it pay their fair share. That means big corporations and billionaires, not the people of this country who deserve so much more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  In commencing my contribution to this debate this evening, I'm forced and really quite happy to have the opportunity to reflect upon the different state of Australian politics that now confronts us, at the end of these first two weeks of sitting, as opposed to the last sitting before the election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in the chamber tonight excellent new colleagues and comrades in the Greens' cause, such as Senator Allman-Payne—and I want to thank you for a fantastic contribution to this debate, one which grounded it back in substance and detail rather than the rhetorically high points we were reaching just before. We have the opportunity to discuss issues, such as the need to tax big corporations at this moment in time, when they are making such outrageous profits, not because they're doing anything new or good or beneficial but simply because they're taking advantage of the fact that there are global factors at the moment—wars in the world and shortages of food—that allow them to make extraordinary profits, doing exactly the same as they were doing last year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also sit in a chamber right now that's being chaired by Dorinda Cox, my colleague from Western Australia, a proud First Nations woman. We have debated, in the course of the week, many pieces of legislation important to the community. And it is the Greens that have taken the initiative this evening, at the end of this sitting period, to put on the agenda of the Senate a rather important question, that being whether these chambers, these houses of parliament, should, at this incredible moment in time—when so many in our community are doing it so tough—proactively take steps to make the rich richer. That's, ultimately, what we are debating tonight. We are only able to do that because of the contribution of a Greens movement, 30 years in the making, supported by tens of thousands of people across the country. Senator Cox sits in the chair this evening because of the work of the Greens WA movement and the work of many great candidates across the country in the run-up to the election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I move to the substance of the debate this evening, I want to place on the record our thanks to the candidates and individuals that played such an important role in the election, without whose contribution this very conversation would not be happening: first of all, our lower house candidates, the fabulous Caroline Perks; in Fremantle, Felicity Townsend; in Curtin, Cameron Pidgeon; in Swan, Clint Uink; in Brand, Heather Lonsdale; in the seat of Burt, Daniel Garlett; in Canning, Jodie Moffat; in Cowan, Isabella Tripp; in Durack, Bianca McNeair; in Forrest, Christine Terrantroy; and in Hasluck, Brendan Sturcke. In Moore we had Mark Cooper. In O'Connor we had Giz Watson, alongside Donna Nelson in Pearce and Adam Abdul Razak in Tangney. Of course, it wouldn't be good not to mention the fantastic support candidates to Senator Cox on the ticket: River Clarke, Simone Collins, Donald Clarke, Jordan Cahill and Alex Wallace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these individuals and their campaign teams gave so much time and energy to our Greens movement throughout the course of the campaign because they understood, as the millions of Greens voters understand, that there is something deeply wrong, deeply broken, at the heart of the major parties. Both sides have now congealed into a centre right lump, unable or unwilling to challenge the vested interests—the mining companies, the gas giants, the coal barons—that for so long have applied pressure on this place, have made donations to the major parties, have lobbied and greased the wheels in this place. And now both sides in this parliament have basically decided on this particular issue, on the issue of whether fairness and justice should be the guiding principle of our taxing contribution system, to give up the conversation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be really clear about what is happening here: the Australian community believes in fairness. Our community believes in compassion. Our community believes in working together, and from this belief comes a support for a contribution system which sees those that have more, pay a bit more, and those that have less, pay a bit less. That's the basic premise of how we pool our resources to get things done collectively, and it's been the work in principle of Australia for decades. The corporations and the gas companies and the coal barons have worked furiously alongside their millionaire mates to undermine that system to claw back the little bit more they're asked to contribute to the pool for themselves, because they are selfish and greedy. They are selfish and greedy, not wanting for others what they have for themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past it has been the role of parties in this place who proclaim themselves to be of the Left to challenge that greed, to call it out, to object to the idea that selfishness is acceptable in public policy. Well, this evening the reality as we sit here tonight is that both parties, the Liberal and Labor parties, are facing a moment in time when so many are struggling, where the cost of education is going up and people are wondering, 'Where is my next meal going to come from? How am I going to pay that bill? How am I going to convince my landlord not to kick me out? How will I keep my kids warm in my car?' At this moment, when it has never been more urgent that we pool our resources and decide to use them in ways that are fair and just, that support people to work together, both of you want to indulge the selfish and the greedy rich, the Clive Palmers and the Gina Rineharts and the Andrew Forrests, who slime around in the background of Australian politics, popping up every now and again to suggest a basics card or a new version of the Indue scheme or to offer their thoughts from on high on how somebody that's getting by on the viciously low level of JobSeeker could better make ends meet. You've decided to get in bed with those people and give them a tax break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I am not at all surprised, given that they put this idea forward in the first place, that the Liberal Party would be sitting there tonight contributing to this debate, supporting this terrible idea. It was their proposition in 2018. It is, however, so soul-rackingly disappointing that even after the Australian community chucked out the Morrison government with a joy unsurpassed in recent electoral history, even after Labor's primary vote went backwards, the Labor Party sits here tonight proposing to plough ahead with this redistribution of community funds, which, by the way, will cost in just one year almost as much as one year's value of the entire Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. You're going to give back $15 billion in one year to people like Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest when instead we could be using it for free child care, to bring dental and mental health into Medicare—to do so many good things together. And why? Because you're too scared to do otherwise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really is a flimsiness that you are bringing to the debate tonight, when there is a parliament ready and willing to ensure that those funds remain in the public service, in the public good. But you will instead back selfishness and greed, despite the fact that our community has just voted for fairness and compassion and a collective working together in greater numbers than ever before. It is such a deep disappointment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to speak directly to this question of a windfall profits tax. Now, this is a proposal put forward and championed by our Treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim, and it is a very, very good idea. It is being backed globally by some of the best minds in socially progressive theory. And, indeed, it is even finding the support in some areas of more traditional economists, purely because it seeks to address an absolute breaking down of the traditional economic theory—a traditional economic theory, by the way, which is completely morally bankrupt. It always has been but now is failing even against its terms of success. Corporations, particularly energy companies, are right now making billions of dollars—not because they are doing any more than they once did. They're not producing more. They're not creating anything. They're engaging in vicious price gouging. Why? Because they can. And who is paying for it? The Australian people are paying for it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  What a great topic to be debating at the end of this Senate week:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate agrees that corporate super profits taxes could offset the cost of providing cost-of-living relief, including the provision of free childcare, truly free public education, abolishing student debt and putting dental and mental health into Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a proposition that we took to the election that resulted in the Greens having a record vote, electing six more members of parliament to this place. The idea that we should be taxing the very wealthy and using those taxes to fund services that people need and that people want resonates with the Australian community. And it's not a surprise, because we have seen the tax that is paid by the super wealthy in Australia decrease at the same time as we have seen the services provided to Australians decrease in quality over the last—well, for decades, basically, under neoliberal governments. We need to shift this. We need to acknowledge that by increasing taxes; by having a corporate super profits tax; by taxing properly the mining companies, the coal and gas companies, who are making an absolute motza at the moment; by having a billionaire tax to tax the billionaires who made massive profits out of COVID while the rest of us were suffering. We had billionaires like Gerry Harvey doing exceptionally well and making a profit out of JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, we should not be going ahead with tax cuts that are going to reduce the taxes and increase the income of the very wealthy in our society. Why on earth this incoming Labor government, who claims to be speaking for the people, is supporting the previous government's stage 3 tax cuts is beyond me, because the critical figure, which I find astounding, is that the cost of those stage 3 tax cuts to the budget bottom line over the 10 years is over $200 billion. We know that, if that $200 billion was instead being spent in services, in supporting people, it would have a much greater impact on the health of the economy because we know that every dollar that you put in the pocket of somebody on a low income gets spent. If you're putting a dollar in the pocket of somebody who earns over $200,000, the likelihood is that it just gets put away in investments, it gets spent on overseas travel or it gets spent on other things that do not generate the same amount of economic activity as spending that money generates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we increase income support, if we increase the income of the lowest people in our society, the people who are absolutely struggling to get by, who are living in poverty—every extra dollar you put in the pocket of somebody who is surviving on JobKeeper at the moment will be spent. It will be spent at the local shops. It will be spent buying basic food, vegetables, clothing and shoes. It will be spent on the absolute essentials of life. We know that spending money in that way is going to make a much greater contribution to our economy than giving tax cuts to the very wealthy, who do not need those tax cuts—who absolutely do not need those tax cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this was a platform that we took to the election. This resonated with people. The concept of the basics of free dental care and mental health care being included under Medicare so that people could afford to go and get their teeth fixed; the idea of genuinely free education, from child care right through to tertiary education—these are the ideas that resonate with Australian society because we know that they are fair. They are creating a fairer, more just, more sustainable society. And we know that, by doing that, we get healthier people, and it leads to a healthier community for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sorts of measures that the Australian people want to see, and they are the measures that we can afford to take. We can afford to be taxing the very wealthy—the people who are making a huge amount of money—and to be spending that money on the services that we need and that we deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of income support, it is our duty to be lifting people out of poverty. It is immoral that we, as a society, have a vast number of people—three million families—living under the poverty line. It's a political choice to be leaving them there, living in poverty. Six hundred thousand children in single-parent families are living under the poverty line. We need to take action to increase income support so that that's no longer the case, so that they can afford to be living a decent life and putting food on the table. It is a political choice that we are not. The Greens absolutely and unashamedly will continue to speak up for increasing the taxes on those who can afford to pay so that we can spend the money on the services that we all need. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a>  They're words that I'm actually going to mention, Minister: 'transparency' and 'accountability', and how quickly the Labor government has been unmasked for their mockery of transparency and accountability, particularly when it comes to their response to foot-and-mouth disease. First, last week they tried to send an examination of their response to foot-and-mouth disease—that was backed by the Greens, obviously, as to varroa mite, but by us as to foot-and-mouth disease—to a committee that was actually controlled by them. And this week there's a response to an order for the production of documents lodged. The questions were asked of the Prime Minister and his department and office. They were: 'We want to know when you requested advice and when you were alerted to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia.' We also requested information around the cooperation with state governments from the PMO and the department in response to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You wouldn't think that, on a matter of public importance and of public commentary such as this, the Prime Minister, his office and his department would have any issue. Minister Watt—such a fabulous new minister—rang us straight away. Our department secretaries met. I was fully briefed. I requested a brief. I wanted to understand how his trip to Indo went, who he's met and who he hasn't. But instead of providing the Senate, the parliament, the Australian public and our livestock industries with answers to very simple questions, tabled here tonight in the Senate is the government claiming a public interest immunity claim over those very, very simple questions, hiding what they knew and when they knew about the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Bali and its impact on our communities, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and on our trading status as a nation more broadly. Is it to protect the minister, whose flatfooted response on this has been well canvassed in this place over the last two weeks? Is it to protect somebody else?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On what grounds is a government failing to answer the basic questions that any minister, let alone the Prime Minister and his office, should be asking with such an issue unfolding on our shores and across the way in Indonesia? When did you know? What did you know? What did you ask for? Heaven help us, if you can't stop it at the border. As I have said repeatedly, we all want you to be successful on this. We want you to stop foot-and-mouth disease, lumpy skin disease and other biosecurity risks from reaching our shores, but heaven help us if our borders are breached. What are you doing with our state and territory governments to ensure we cauterise that? There should be no secret about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a topic discussed at the agriculture ministers' meeting. There shouldn't be any issues around this. Minister Watt's team should have been briefing the Prime Minister on the outcome of that MinCo, or, at the very least, at a departmental official level if it wasn't minister to Prime Minister. What do they have to hide? What don't they want the Australian Senate to know? What don't they want our peak industry bodies to know about their response and who knew what when? This is from a Prime Minister who's made a lot of noise about a different kind of politics in this place, of transparency, of accountability. Well, in this chamber, we take these things seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank senators around the chamber for assisting in having this conversation tonight and getting this document into the public sphere. This is a government seeking to cover up, literally two minutes before Senate adjournment—in the only place in the Australian public that provides the type of oversight and accountability that we need to ensure executive government is held accountable and held up to the light so that Australians can be aware of what executive government is doing—on an issue as serious as this, with the fumbles and missteps that we've seen from the minister. We've seen the minister want to run out the Defence Force today. He was dismissive of foot mats three weeks ago, but we'll get the Defence Force on the case today. You know what—it is an issue. You are taking it seriously. The people aren't being hysterical, but they're concerned with this government's response. Senators have asked the question around this chamber for two weeks: What are you doing; update us? What has been tabled from the Prime Minister's office today by the minister is a shame. We will pursue this further, and we will ask ministers to attend the chamber and explain when we come back here. It is unacceptable. Australians expected better. They took him at this word when he said 'transparency' and 'accountability'. In the first sitting week, he's failed to provide that at every single hurdle. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been attempts throughout history to silence voices at the margins, particularly the LGBTQIA+ community over many, many years.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important to put on the record two important things that have happened in recent days. I had a meeting with Alphacrucis University College representatives earlier this week. They reminded me of a visit that I had to the St Philip's Teaching School in the Hunter region, which is one of seven teacher-training hubs that are underway. We know that there is a crisis in teaching. These seven hubs are being facilitated through a community of faith which believes in the power of education as transformative and which, obviously, wants to prioritise teaching in a particular tradition, which is the Christian tradition. They are now being rolled out in teaching schools in Sydney, which are elite sandstone schools; at the St Thomas Aquinas Teaching School in the Tasmanian Catholic diocese—and I see that Senator Bilyk is here; it's great to see Tasmania being involved in this sort of research as well and not just the mainland; the CEM Teacher Training School, which is a regional Christian education network; and, very importantly to me, in the seat of Parkes there is a north-west New South Wales cluster in a public school network. Critically, this work is being inspired by a sense of faith in action in the community to make life better for very many people and it's proving incredibly successful in keeping 95 per cent of those enrolled in the program. So there is a lot of research being done about that and I want to acknowledge that leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak very briefly on another topic, and I encourage people to look at a document that was provided to me by the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference. The Australian Catholic Church is celebrating Social Justice Sunday on 28 August. There is a report from them, which I have read, in which I think there is some very significant truth-telling. This will just give you a little taste of the humility that I think is important for the church to bring to the public conversation. The voice shouldn't be silenced, the work can be done, but this is telling truth that I think is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm reading from Ellen and her sister, Frances, who are adult survivors of an abusive relationship in their Christian family during their childhood. This is what they wrote:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… domestic abuse is not restricted to Christian culture; it is important that we realise the power of religious manipulation to keep people in abusive relationships. Abuses and victims can use various religious lenses to justify their reasons (Battaglia, 2001). The church must begin to recognise and condemn the use of Biblical references to justify abuse. Mail-headship in the home does not give a man the right to abuse his wife. Yet to both the abuser and the abused, Biblical interpretation plays a crucial role in how the relationship is perceived. Many Christian women who experience intimate partner abuse feel it is their duty as a Christian wife to sacrifice and forgive their spouse. The children in these relationships often feel, as we did, that they must respect the father and not say anything about what is truly going on inside the home—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… when it comes to sharing our story with our Christian friends, we both feel incredible resistance from people listening to and accepting our family narrative. They think we are lying.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to have these conversations. The language of faith and the language not of faith should never be allowed to continue to result in the terrible tragedy of home and family violence. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">K</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I was pleased to hear about the Albanese Labor government's decision, on 1 July this year, to approve the Grace Tame Foundation for deductible gift recipient status. This means Australians can make monetary donations or donations of property to the foundation and claim a tax deduction for the value of their donation. The foundation offers lived-experience-based advice to promote the prevention and control of sexual abuse, and raises public awareness of sexual abuse in institutional settings. I've met Grace Tame. I've spoken with her a couple of times, and, I've got to say, she is one of the most impressive young people I have met. She's a fierce, powerful and courageous advocate for ending the practices of grooming and child sexual abuse, and the way she has confronted her own trauma and used that story as a weapon in the fight against child sexual abuse is inspiring. She is one very strong young woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Minister Rishworth and Assistant Minister Leigh for adding the foundation to the Register of Harm Prevention Charities within six weeks of the election. The foundation's application for charity status was first submitted on 1 July 2021. Sadly, that means the previous government held the application back for 44 weeks—almost a year—without approving it. I'd be interested to hear the previous government's excuse for delaying the approval for so long. We do know that Ms Tame revealed publicly that she'd been threatened before the election to support the former Prime Minister or risk losing the government's support for the foundation. Was that what happened? This delay was, at best, an egregious failure in administration by the previous government or, at worst, ideologically motivated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just one of the multiple harm-prevention charities that should have received DGR status long ago. Now it has fallen to Labor to clear the backlog. Among the other charities are Consent Labs Ltd, a charity that promotes the prevention of sexual, physical and emotional abuse; Carlton Respects, established by Carlton Football Club, which promotes the prevention or control of abusive behaviour, in particular violence against women, and increasing gender equality; the Healthy Minds Club, a men's mental health organisation; KYUP Project Ltd, a charity that promotes the prevention and control of self-harm and physical, emotional and sexual abuse; the Jack Beasley Fund Inc., whose purpose is to bring about changes to the culture around knife crime; the Australian Jewish Association Inc., whose purpose is to protect the Jewish community within Australia, particularly from antisemitism, and to facilitate cooperation, harmony and peaceful coexistence within Australian society; and the Ping Ming Health Community Association Inc., whose purpose is to promote harm prevention through combined education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention lastly, because it's one of my favourite charities—I've got three or four that I spend a lot of time and effort with—A Fairer World. Based in Hobart, A Fairer World provides ways for schools, workplaces and the Tasmanian community to learn, connect and act together for positive social change. I've had a fair bit to do with A Fairer World over the years, attending and supporting school expos they run with their diversity education program and their 'are you Making a Difference?', or ruMAD, program. I've also seen the amazing work they've done more recently with their human libraries, which use trained volunteers, known as 'human books', to promote understanding and inclusion through telling their personal stories. I'm proud to say that I've remained one of their members for many, many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is to the great shame of those opposite that they've held up these DGR status applications for so long. We know that DGR status provides a great incentive for donors and that every delay after applying for DGR status costs the charities money. It's now fallen—like a whole lot of other things—to the Albanese Labor government to clear the backlog of delayed applications left by the previous government. These are all very deserving charities, every single one of them. They're all doing amazing work in the community and they deserve to have their applications dealt with in a timely manner, not held up because of some ideological view or because somebody said something that the Prime Minister didn't like. That is absolutely abhorrent behaviour. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  This month the AFL will make a decision on the Tasmanian bid for an AFL team—a 19th team, a standalone team. To put it simply, Tasmania should have a team in the AFL. We are in fact a foundation AFL state. We are home to some of the oldest AFL clubs in the country. The club where I played and the club where my sons played, the Devonport Football Club, was founded in 1881, before many of the current AFL clubs came into being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is an AFL state, and for the AFL to be a truly national competition Tasmania should have a team. The Tasmanian government has submitted a bid to the AFL which seeks, as I said, a standalone team, a 19th team, in the national competition. That submission clearly shows that a Tasmanian AFL team stacks up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A subsequent review commissioned by the AFL, conducted by Colin Carter, likewise concludes that a Tasmanian team stacks up. In fact the Carter report says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today, the AFL's 'purpose' is: "Progress the game, so that everyone can share in its heritage and possibilities". Presumably, this applies to Tasmania. It seems fair to argue that the onus of proof is not on Tasmania to justify its inclusion. It is on those who say it should stay excluded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the quote from the Carter report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having established the case for a team in the AFL, at the last minute another hurdle has been put in the way of Tasmania. Apparently now we need to have a new stadium. What's happened all of a sudden? It wasn't part of the submission from the Tasmanian government. It wasn't required in the Carter report. In fact the Carter report talked about having a stadium strategy. We're very comfortable with that. We have two very good stadiums in Tasmania—Bellerive Oval in Hobart and York Park in Launceston—which currently host AFL games. So why this sudden requirement? Have the AFL suddenly got cold feet? Are they trying to put a last-minute hurdle in Tasmania's way? They shouldn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the history of new teams coming into the AFL, none of them have had that hurdle. Brisbane came in back in 1987. They started at Carrara before moving to the Gabba in 1997. Those two ovals have both had development over the years. It was not a pre-requirement for the team to come into the competition. The West Coast Eagles came in back in 1987. They didn't get a new stadium for more than 30 years. Adelaide, in 1991, didn't see a new major development for 20 years. Fremantle, in 1995, are obviously benefiting from the new stadium in Perth. And, likewise, Port Adelaide—it was 20 years after they came in that a new stadium was built. Gold Coast came in back in 2008. Their advantage was the Commonwealth Games in 2018; their stadium was significantly upgraded for that event. And GWS are still developing their stadium. Given that history, on what basis does the AFL think it can suddenly put a hurdle in Tasmania's way? I say congratulations to Tasmanian Premier Rockliff for saying it how it is: 'We have two stadiums. We're not going to be dictated to by the AFL. We won't be stood over. We won't be patronised by the AFL like we have for years.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the AFL Hall of Fame there are 24 legends. Four of them are Tasmanian—Baldock, Hart, Hudson, Stewart. Tasmania has as many legends of the game in the Hall of Fame as South Australia and Western Australia combined. We have a very proud heritage in the game. I've had AFL clubs coming to me over the last three years seeking funding for their community developments. Why can't Tasmania as a community have its own team? So here's the rub from my perspective: perhaps the message from this place to the AFL should be that not a single dollar of Commonwealth money goes to any club until Tasmania has its 19th team in the competition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  I rise to speak tonight to remember and celebrate the life of Bill Chandler OAM, who passed away peacefully on 24 July. At his funeral on Monday, Bill was described as 'a giant in the world of planning' and a towering figure for more than half a century across the built-environment professions, with an immense impact locally, nationally and globally. Rod Duncan, a pretty significant figure himself in the planning profession, went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bill was not a daunting or overwhelming sort of giant, but mellow, approachable and welcoming; somehow managing to make everyone feel like they were his special confidant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A sort of Uncle Bill, with his grey beard, bulging briefcase, and grey coat; just off the train from Surrey Hills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's how I knew Bill. I worked with Bill in the mid-2000s, when I was a councillor at the City of Maribyrnong and chair of the Metropolitan Transport Forum, working for sustainable transport. We engaged Bill to do some research and campaigning work with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've stayed in touch with Bill since then and, particularly after I was elected to the Senate, Bill made sure to stay in touch with me. He appreciated in particular being in touch with the politics of action and inaction on climate in this place. Bill sustained pressure on his federal members of parliament on humanitarian and environmental issues over many years, including as part of his local climate group, Lighter Footprints. Bill stood as an independent in the seat of Kooyong at the 2019 election, and his work in this campaign, alongside that of fellow climate independent Oliver Yates and our Greens candidate, Julian Burnside, was a significant factor in paving the way for the successful election of independent Monique Ryan at this year's election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Bill's funeral, Rod Duncan summarised his career:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bill joined the Royal Australian Planning Institute in 1966, and was an officer bearer from the 1970s … His commitment to what matured into the Planning Institute of Australia extended over 56 years, only recently stepping down as Managing Editor of its monthly journal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By 1974, in addition to his day job, Bill was lecturing a room-full of future leaders in the profession who had enrolled in Melbourne University's new Graduate Diploma program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Beyond occasional formal teaching roles, Bill was a perpetual educator, through innumerable conferences, publications and conversations. He was a great communicator, and built lifelong Connections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a vocal advocate of social justice and equality, he was diligent in ensuring female practitioners were heard and encouraged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bill was early to recognise that Planning alone was only part of the toolkit for enriching cities and society, so he embraced allied perspectives and professions that also influence urban conditions and outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, Bill was recognised as being pivotal to the development of the field of urban design in Australia. Planner John Burns said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australian cities owe Bill a debt. You cannot conceive how we would have got to here without him, for he was central over decades to the creation and promotion of the critically important national Urban Design dialogue: as activist, teacher, professional, communicator, mentor, catalyst, networker and organiser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I received today, hot off the press, the latest edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Planning News</span>, the journal that Bill was the managing editor of for so long, which features glowing tributes to Bill Chandler. In remembering him, the journal noted that they'd been overwhelmed at the number of warm and heartfelt tributes to Bill flowing in. Bill's family have shared some of these tributes with me, many of them from some pretty luminary figures in the field of planning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rob Adams described Bill as 'truly a remarkable man who helped so many of us to share his wisdom. He was a tireless, optimistic and always humorous campaigner for better people places, and our cities are better as a result of Bill's life's work.' Marcus Spiller said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In his passing, I've come to appreciate Bill as the unofficial coach of planning in Victoria; not the belligerent, carping type but rather inspiring his players with his crystal clarity on what planning stands for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And younger planner Ben Cooke noted how many generations of planners benefited from Bill's energy, enthusiasm and experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At events, you always knew when Bill was in the room—centrally positioned, more often than not with a full glass of red, with planners orbiting around him, in and out of conversation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, Bill was also passionate about his local patch, Surrey Hills. He was one of the leaders of a campaign against a massive road flyover in the 1970s. He edited the Surrey Hills <span style="font-style:italic;">Neighbourhood New</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> from its inaugural edition in 1982. He said, 'I see my life as a citizen first and an urban planner second.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill's health had deteriorated in recent years with his cancer and his cancer treatment, but he continued to contribute. He's survived by his wife, Ros, and their children, Andrew, Elizabeth and Kate. I acknowledge Andrew and Audrey in the gallery tonight. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
