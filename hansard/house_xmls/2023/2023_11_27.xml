            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Endometriosis is a chronic and often debilitating medical condition that impacts the lives of countless women, including myself. I have personally experienced the challenges and pain associated with this condition for years, until I discovered a medication called Visanne. This medication has been a game-changer for me, enabling me to lead a pain-free life and significantly improving my quality of life. However, there is a pressing issue surrounding Visanne that I believe deserves attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visanne, while highly effective, is unfortunately an expensive medication that many women with endometriosis cannot afford. The most affordable option I have found costs $70 a month, a significant financial burden for individuals like me who may also have other medical conditions, such as anxiety, and other financial responsibilities to manage. It is deeply concerning to think about the younger women who are juggling work, studies, and daily expenses while also facing the choice between purchasing groceries or the medication that allows them to live without excruciating pain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The financial challenges posed by the cost of Visanne have been exacerbated by recent inflation and economic difficulties that have affected us all. In this context, I kindly request that you consider taking action to help women in our community who suffer from endometriosis access this vital medication by adding it to the PBS. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to support women suffering from Endometriosis in adding Visanne to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) to improve access to better treatment for women managing chronic pain.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Accessing compulsory schooling through boarding institutions comes at a considerable cost to geographically isolated families. Recent survey data, collected from a cross-section of ICPA members nationwide, showed that more than 75% of respondents bear out-of-pocket expenses of over $5000.00 per term just for boarding fees and essential travel. This gap is their out-of-pocket expenses after they receive the Federal Government's Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Basic Boarding Allowance (BBA0. That is an out-of-pocket gap of over $20,000 per year per student. These calculations do not include the additional costs of school or tuition fees. This expense is becoming increasingly unsustainable. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With the disparity between the AIC Boarding Allowance and the actual cost of boarding fees across Australia continues to grow, impacting on the allowance's intent and effectiveness. Rural and remote families are required to contribute increasingly more towards the cost of their children's compulsory education year after year with only incremental annual increases to the allowance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We request the Australian government establish an enforceable passenger compensation scheme to address the persistent issues faced by airline passengers who endure delays and cancellations. The primary motivation behind this initiative is to safeguard the rights and well-being of travellers while promoting accountability within the aviation industry, something that is lacking at the moment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians heavily rely on air travel for connectivity, making timely and reliable flights essential. However, passengers often find themselves stranded at airports due to unforeseen delays or abrupt cancellations, causing substantial inconvenience and financial loss. A compensation scheme would provide much-needed recourse for affected travelers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, such a scheme would incentivise airlines to improve their operational efficiency and communication with passengers. It would discourage airlines from overbooking flights or routinely rescheduling, rerouting and cancelling departures without adequate notice. Passengers invest not just money but also time and trust in airlines, which should be reciprocated with a commitment to service and punctuality. The current system isn't working, and the lack of competition means passengers have no choice and no recourse when things go wrong. The airlines know this.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to implement an enforceable passenger compensation scheme to protect the interests of airline passengers in Australia. It would not only alleviate the hardships faced by travelers but also encourage airlines to prioritise punctuality and customer satisfaction. By taking this step, the Australian government can enhance the overall travel experience and strengthen its commitment to consumer rights in the aviation sector.</span>

Their lives are basically at pause because they cannot make material changes of their circumstances, otherwise their visa could get refused. On top of that, the amount of uncertanty caused by long waiting time can have impact on health, creating another risk factor that their visa might be refused because of degrading health, as the health examination for visa purpose is only valid for 12 months. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 24 August 2023, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) was allowed by Japanese government to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean with a decades-long plan to dump 1.34 Million cubic meres of wastewater-around 540 Olympic Swimming pools's worth, which has been used to cool the plant's wrecked reactors. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a major nuclear disaster caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, and causing a loss of power and leading to three nuclear meldowns, 3x hydrogen explosions, and the release of radioactive contamination. Since then, water has been used to keep the three damaged reactors from overheating with the contaminated water being stored in about 1000 tanks. The Japanese nuclear-contaminated water dumped now has fundamental difference from the discharge of the nuclear plants which are normally operated in terms of the category of radionuclides, original source or disposal treatment imparity. Dumping any sort of waste water including nuclear contaminated waste water would pose serious risk to our delicate ecosystem and ultimately the world including Australia. Japanese nuclear contaminated wastewater will carry the contaminants like tritium and radionuclides, it eventually will damage Australians marine life and our human health.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Our government recommends breastfeeding for the first year of a child's life. This is challenging to do if one is required to go back to work after paid parental leave ends. Some women cannot pump breastmilk or have the ability to work from home to continue breastfeeding their baby. Employees are only entitled to 4 weeks of annual leave a year therefore, unless the employer has their own scheme in place, the most paid leave a woman can take is 6 months. It is not uncommon either for a woman to commence her maternity leave one month prior to her baby's due date. Changing the scheme to one year additionally alleviates pressure from daycares, caretakers such as grandparents and removes unwanted guilt from the mother for returning to work so soon.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In today's digital age, consumers engage with online platforms and services, often necessitating recurring payments, or trial periods.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Many users might become incapacitated, pass away, or simply forget about these dormant accounts. Yet, without any service provision or engagement, these companies persistently draw funds. This is not just an oversight; it's an exploitative practice. A user's inactivity, especially over prolonged periods, should signal the potential need for a review or cessation of charges. Instead, many face financial drains for services they no longer use or might be unaware they're even paying for.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By ending automatic rebilling for inactive accounts, we protect consumers from undue financial burdens and ensure that companies act in good faith, aligning their revenue with actual service provision. This change will promote fairness and integrity in online business practices, urging companies to prioritize genuine service over opportunistic profit.</span>

This legislation should require these companies to notify users of their inactivity and give them an option to continue or discontinue the service before any further charges are applied. By implementing this change, the House will be protecting consumers at the federal level from unwarranted financial drains. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I write to you on behalf of the Australian immigrant community, appealing for critical improvements in travel accessibility, specifically focusing on affordable flights and service quality.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's legacy of embracing immigrants from diverse backgrounds enriches our nation both culturally and economically. Travel is an essential lifeline for immigrants, connecting them with their roots, families, and global networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">1. **Financial Hurdles**: The exorbitant airfare costs, especially during peak times, impose significant financial burdens on immigrants, forcing many to endure prolonged separations from loved ones.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">2. **Service Standards**: All travelers, including immigrants, deserve a secure and comfortable travel experience. Yet, the service quality on some economical flights often falls below acceptable standards, causing discomfort and dissatisfaction.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">1. **Subsidized Air Travel**: Investigate the feasibility of subsidizing airfare for immigrants during pivotal family events or emergencies to ease the financial burden.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">2. **Service Enhancement**: Collaborate with airlines to raise the service quality on economical flights, ensuring that all passengers, including immigrants, enjoy safe and comfortable journeys.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">3. **Expanded Accessibility**: Vigorously work towards expanding flight route options, especially in remote areas, providing immigrants with more travel choices and convenience.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement to show ID has been brought in under the guise of making things harder for criminals—to prevent title theft, clamp down on illegal immigration, prevent money laundering, prevent funding of terrorism, etc. However, the requirement to show ID is a denial of the presumption of innocence. One of the main concerns of a centralised digital ID system is that it would be used to cut political opponents off from participating in the economy. We saw a taste of this during the so-called pandemic, when state governments imposed vaccine mandates, requiring people to show vaccine certificates connected to their identity. People were denied employment and services based on private medical information connected to their identity. This is a concrete example of how ID requirements have been abused. And given that no level of government has acknowledged that vaccine mandates were wrong, there is no reason to believe that something like this won't happen again. This centralised digital ID is being touted as voluntary, but if something will eventually be compulsory, then it was never really voluntary. And there is good reason to believe that a government-issued digital ID will soon be compulsory, with many countries floating the idea of digital currencies and requiring an ID to access the internet. There are security concerns, as well, with everyone's ID and other personal details being stored in a centralised system. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Northern Territory has by far the highest rates of domestic, family and sexual violence (DFSV) in Australia—three times the national average. The rate of domestic homicide is seven times the national average. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Part of the problem is that the Commonwealth Government provides funding to states and territories based on population, rather than need. The NT has a small population so its share of national funding is never sufficient given the extreme level of need in the Territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">We the People of Australia demand that our House of Representatives act with strength concerning the matter of Julian Assange. The UK and the US engage in grave abuse of human rights. Julian Assange, an Australian citizen and journalist, has been subject to internationally recognised torture. He faces unjust extra-territorial prosecution by the US and UK for publishing information of public interest. If the Australian Government weakly allows our allies to engage in such abuse of an Australian citizen, this places all Australians at risk. The precedent poses a significant threat to individual Australians and our national security. Any Australian citizen travelling abroad now faces such extra-territorial prosecution and indeed, torture. This threat must be acknowledged by the Australian Government and dealt with. Statements by Anthony Blinken that Australia "understand our concerns about this matter" indicate that the US seeks to normalise human rights abuse and torture of Australian citizens. We do not tolerate this, and ask our representatives to act forthrightly in accordance with the rights of Julian and the Australian People. As Senator Penny Wong stated regarding sanctions on other nations committing human rights abuse: "The government will bring all aspects of Australian power to our foreign policy, employ every strategy at our disposal towards upholding rights consistent with our values and our interests." We demand the same resolve in the case of Julian Assange.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Respected Members of Parliament, we seek your support for the Iranian-Australian community in facilitating a vital meeting with Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi to advance democratic change in Iran. Such a meeting holds immense relevance for Australia, aligning with democratic values and fostering economic opportunities potentially worth trillions of dollars. It elevates Australia's global standing and promotes regional stability.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, an advocate for democracy and human rights, enjoys overwhelming popularity among Iranians. His vision for Iran emphasizes secular democracy, political freedom, inclusivity, and free elections. He has actively engaged with the international community, including an official visit to Israel, conveying a message of peace through the Cyrus Accords.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast to some other opposition groups who are often missing a clear vision for a post-regime Iran, with instances of alignment with the Islamic Republic's positions on subjects such as Israel, regional peace, and inclusion, his leadership stands out as a credible and compelling force for positive change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This diplomatic engagement offers a unique opportunity to strengthen relations and access Iran's burgeoning market, specifically in mining and farming industries. His commitment to democracy ensures that any future Iranian government would be chosen through fair and free elections, aligning with Australia's values.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Work out if the amendments are for health reasons or our nation will lose Sovereignty and our citizens will lose freedom of health decisions. Parliament works for the Australian public and as such Globalist agendas should be secondary to what is best for the Nation. No agreement should be made until Parliament has read and discussed the implications of this agreement which on reading risks our country not being able to make its own health outcomes. The Prime Minister is able to write a letter to the WHO and invoke Article 61 and reject the IHR for our nation. This in my opinion is the safest outcome. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We request that Parliament vote on whether to accept or reject the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) that were adopted by the 75th World Health Assembly on 27 May 2022. Every nation, including Australia, has the authority to reject these amendments under Article 61 of the IHR, but any such rejection must be within 18 months of their adoption. This must be done before the end of November 2023. The changes to Article 59 of the IHR would shorten the time for future amendments to enter into force from 24 to 12 months and would shorten the period of time for rejection or reservations to be submitted from 18 to 10 months. We object to these changes. The amendments to the IHR that were adopted on 27 May 2022 have not been debated in or voted on by Parliament. This is compounded by the fact that an additional 307 proposed amendments are currently being negotiated by the Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (WGIHR). The people of Australia have not had an opportunity to express their opinions regarding these legally-binding changes to international law.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">NDIS has been supporting individuals and their families for 10 years, in this time the structures and processes have been lead by western view, western way and western connections. Aboriginal families have been struggling to receive effective cultural support from NDIS for 10 years and in some cases identity has completely been dismissed as irrelevant to having a disability. Aboriginal peoples have no direct funding to directly engage cultural supports, cultural healing practices and cultural connections. Mainstream services access an Aboriginal participants NDIS budget to include social participation and often does not include any cultural value to the participants daily lives. Cultural healing practices do not fit the criteria of Allied Health according to the NDIS guidelines and Aboriginal participants are not able to access healing through their NDIS plans that is culturally responsive and supportive. By excluding cultural supports in NDIS budgeting means Aboriginal participants and their families are struggling to feel connected and supported from services. Mainstream services are utilising budgets and excluding cultural needs in the process. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider adding a budget component to Aboriginal participants NDIS plans that are culturally exclusive for practices and supports that increase a participants cultural connection and healing practices. We also recommend that this budget only be accessible by Aboriginal companies and organisations for the purposes of cultural engagement and support. Big NGO's not be able to access this section of the budget even if they present a reasonable cultural plan. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Medical practitioners do not take time or care to support their patients in applying for NDIS, medical practitioners are not accountable for their role in NDIS applications and setting patients back months and sometimes years in being successful for NDIS applications when they need support and caring to be implemented. One doctor in a clinic in Blacktown had a tantrum in front of a patient and went to the management and refused to fill in forms, other examples are medical practitioners are writing the bare minimum and barely reading the questions. Patients should not be punished for the lack of doctor knowledge, care or willingness to take part in NDIS processes. The NDIS recommends participants call Local Area Coordinators who then say go to your doctor. The patient is not the medical professional yet they are writing their own NDIS applications for doctors to sign. One NDIS employee told a patient to doctor shop to get their paperwork filled out. Patients are being rejected 3-7 times and having to spend months, due to lack of medical support available when NDIS paperwork is needed. It is hard enough living with a disability, medical teams are causing mental and emotional harm. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">According to polls, the No campaign looks set to win by a large margin, but the Government is making it clear that it won't take no for an answer. The government is poised to blame the failure of the Voice on Chinese bots and neo-Nazis. In recent years, Western governments have demonstrated that they don't respect election and referendum results. Take Brexit as an example. For the last seven years the British establishment has sought to scupper Brexit. And if Labor wins next year's general election, Britain looks set to rejoin the EU. You could also look at the 2016 US presidential election. For four years, the establishment tried to undermine Trump's administration. They engineered his defeat in 2020. And they are now running a campaign to ensure that he won't be re-elected in 2024. The Voice referendum is shaping up to be Australia's Brexit moment, Australia's Trump moment. I am concerned that concerned that the referendum result will be used as a pretext to increase censorship, restrict freedom of speech and clamp down on dissent. All the rhetoric points to this.</span>

Please enforce warnings with fines then jail time and if they still continue to disrespect Australia deport them</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Telecommunications</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing in relation to correspondence of 14 February 2022 sent by the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, Mr Ken O'Dowd, to the former Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, concerning Petition EN3653—<span style="font-style:italic;">Introduce Legislation to Ban Telecommunications Companies from Locking Phones to Their Networks, </span>initiated by Ms Rebecca Smith.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I apologise for the time it has taken for a response to be provided to the Committee in relation to this matter. The petition was provided to the former Government, and was subsequently delayed due to oversights in the Department's handling procedures. The Department has put in place processes to make sure such a delay does not happen in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition asked that the House of Representatives introduce legislation to ban telecommunications companies from locking phones to their network. The Australian Government does not have plans to prohibit telecommunications providers from locking phones to their network at this time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telecommunications providers tend to only issue locked mobile handsets for pre-paid services, particularly if the provider has subsidised the price of the handset. Sometimes these devices can be unlocked for a fee, depending on how long the device has been active.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are other options in the market for customers seeking an unlocked phone. Post-paid handsets are not ordinarily locked to a particular network. Telecommunications providers also offer a number of SIM-only mobile phone plans, which allow consumers to use their existing handset, or purchase an unlocked handset from a variety of in-store or online retailers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, all companies that sell telecommunications products are required to provide a Critical Information Summary, which outlines what is included in the product being offered, the fees and charges, how long the contract lasts, and what a customer should do if they have a complaint. The information in the summary is designed to assist consumers to make informed choices about the products they are considering.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Information about what consumers should consider when selecting a new mobile device, or when entering into a contract with a service provider, is available on the website of the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), at www.acma.gov.au/understand-your-telco-contract.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a consumer considers that they have been misinformed during the purchase of their mobile device, or if they experience difficulty unlocking their mobile handset directly with their provider, they can contact the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) for assistance. The TIO is a free and independent alternative dispute resolution body for consumers with complaints about their telephone or internet service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TIO aims to settle disputes in a fair, objective and non-bureaucratic way, having regard not only to the law and to good industry practice, but also to what it considers is fair and reasonable. The TIO can be contacted via its website at www.tio.com.au/contact-us or by telephone on 1800 062 058.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Standing Committee for bringing Ms Smith's petition to the Government's attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Industry and Science, the Hon Ed Husic MP, regarding petition EN4147 to amend legislation prohibiting the use of nuclear fusion energy. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister responsible for Climate Change and Energy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has committed to reducing emissions to 43 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Nuclear fusion remains an experimental technology and will be developed and commercialised too slowly to help Australia meet these targets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, reports that the construction and operation of demonstration electricity-producing fusion power plants could occur by 2050, depending on funding and technical advancement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GenCost 2022-23 Report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator, shows that renewables are the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and cheaper to operate than nuclear power facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative prohibition on the approval of nuclear power plants under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>does not differentiate between nuclear technologies. The Australian Government has no plans to change the longstanding moratorium on nuclear power in Australia, or the laws which prohibit its deployment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns of this petition to the Government's attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4158 on creating an Access First Home Owners Grant—a grant of $50,000 directed towards people with disabilities, or their immediate carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government understands safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians. Australia's Disability Strategy 2021—2031 (the Strategy) acknowledges the importance of appropriate housing as critical to a person's sense of home and their ability to participate in their communities. Policy Priority 1 under the Strategy commits all parties to increase the availability of affordable housing. This requires collaboration from all levels of government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the Albanese Government funds Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) for eligible NDIS participants who cannot live in mainstream housing because of their particular support needs, or whose needs are most appropriately met by an SDA response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS also has a range of home and living supports including home modifications that can support people with disability to reach their goals and live an independent life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that on 29 September the final report of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability was published. The report included a number of recommendations regarding housing for people with a disability. The Albanese Government announced a Commonwealth Disability Royal Commission Taskforce to coordinate the Government's response to the Royal Commission's recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More broadly, the Albanese Government is working with the state, territory and local governments to deliver better housing outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes the work being delivered through the National Cabinet to provide more secure and affordable housing supply. Significant measures include:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4179 on lowering the price of diesel fuel to better match the price of unleaded fuel. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that the cost of fuel is putting family and business budgets under significant pressure and driving up the price of essentials like groceries. It remains critical that fuel companies promptly pass on reductions in international oil prices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is responsible for monitoring fuel prices and plays a critical role in ensuring that market participants do not take advantage of consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Report on the Australian Petroleum market </span>for the June 2023 quarter found that diesel prices were significantly higher than petrol prices for several reasons. International prices for diesel were higher than for petrol, driven by reduced supply from Russia given the conflict in Ukraine, reduced supply from France due to refinery strikes, reduced exports from China, low global stocks and higher demand for diesel for heating during the northern hemisphere winter. Diesel, unlike petrol, has broader uses in industry and electricity generation that affect demand and therefore price.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC has found that, in recent months, the prices of diesel and petrol have converged with the price of diesel dipping lower than petrol. The decrease in diesel prices has been influenced by continuing exports from Russia despite sanctions imposed by the United States, reduced diesel consumption due to decreased manufacturing and freight activity in North America and Europe, and an unexpected build up in global diesel inventories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the independent regulator enforcing Australia's competition and consumer laws, the ACCC investigates concerns arising about misrepresentations regarding fuel prices, and false and misleading conduct or anti-competitive conduct in fuel markets and takes appropriate action. In addition, the ACCC is engaging with major retailers and wholesalers to ensure that they do not mislead Australian consumers about the rationale for any price rises.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4244 regarding a moratorium on regional bank closures and the establishment of a Parliamentary inquiry. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that branch closures are disruptive for customers in regional and rural areas, particularly for those experiencing vulnerability. I am also sorry to hear about the difficulties people are facing with regard to access to banking services.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Amid the increasing availability of banking alternatives like telephone, online and mobile app banking, there has been a decline in over-the-counter transactions and a shift to online activity. These shifts in consumer demand and new technologies have contributed to banks reducing their branch networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is concerned about the impact of these developments on communities who need access to face-to-face banking services, as well as on small businesses that need to access and deposit cash.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post's Bank@Post service is part of the solution. Through this service, customers can make withdrawals, deposits and balance enquiries at their local Post Office. Currently, over 3,500 Post Offices are providing access to more than 80 banks and financial institutions. This includes more than 1,800 Bank@Post offices in rural and remote locations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Initiated in February 2023, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee is currently examining the impact of regional bank branch closures.

                </span>As you may know, the former Government announced in the 2021-22 Budget that it would replace the individual tax residency rules with a new, modernised framework.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government publicly consulted for 9 weeks ending 22 September 2023 on the proposed new individual tax residency framework.

In addition, we are investing in the Capacity Investment Scheme, which will deliver at least 6 GW of dispatchable renewable energy, boosting reliability and putting downward pressure on prices. We are also investing $100 million in solar banks and $200 million in new community batteries to help more people access solar and maximise the benefits of Australia's energy transformation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4283 on the utilisation of unoccupied housing for those suffering from homelessness, poverty and general malaise from lack of rental properties. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Labor Government understands safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians. Sadly, many Australians cannot find an affordable place to buy, rising interest rates have been difficult news for those with a mortgage and the rental market is also very tight with low vacancy rates and increasing rents across Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has committed to an ambitious housing reform agenda which will boost the supply of all housing—more public and social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These housing challenges cannot be solved by one government alone. The Albanese Government is working with the state, territory and local governments to deliver better housing outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes the work being delivered through the National Cabinet to provide more secure and affordable housing supply. Significant measures include:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We are working with states and territories to deliver the Help to Buy Scheme, supporting up to 40,000 low and middle income households to purchase a home of their own.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the correspondence of 31 July 2023 from the Secretariat Standing Committee on Petitions, enclosing Petition EN4315, with two (2) signatures, presented in the House on 7 November 2022, concerning offshore student visa processing matters for Bangladesh nationals. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the petitioners' concerns around the low percentage of offshore student visas granted to Bangladesh nationals in 2020 compared to other top source countries. It is no secret that the international travel restrictions in place (from March 2020 through to December 2021) due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the offshore student visa activity (lodged and subsequently finalised) and affected all nationalities including Bangladesh.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to use this opportunity to advise that, from 2005-06 (when reports become available) to 2022-23 for the primary offshore student visa caseload:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Bangladesh nationals represented an average 1 per cent of total visa granted. This is attributed to Bangladesh representing only 1.1 per cent (average) of student visa applications submitted to the Department of Home Affairs; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Between 2017-18 (when the Department ceased offshore student visa processing in Bangladesh) and 2022-23, average grant rate for Bangladesh nationals was 90.3 per cent. This is a 15.7 per cent improvement compared to the average grant rate (74.6 per cent) between 2005-06 and 2016-17. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Data source: Department of Home Affairs and published at https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/student-visas</span>).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The change in student visa processing arrangements has not adversely impacted decision outcomes for Bangladeshi student visa applicants. As always, applications are assessed on their individual merits against the regulatory criteria prescribed in Australia's migration legislation. These criteria apply universally irrespective of the student visa applicant's nationality and/or the location where the visa application is processed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, I wish to advise the committee that the Department continues to monitor visa decision outcomes through a robust program of quality assurance. The Department samples and examines the decisions and decision making process applied to cases across our network, ensuring that appropriate compliance with the legislation is maintained.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the petitioners' request to reestablish student visa processing arrangements in Bangladesh. It is however imperative that decisions made to establish an offshore presence must be balanced against our focus on efficient, cost effective services which enhance our ability to uphold the integrity of Australia's visa programs in general, including for student visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is not considering the reestablishment of visa processing arrangements in Bangladesh. I do however welcome more Bangladesh nationals to consider Australia's international student visa program to study and enhance their skills while also contributing to the Australian workforce and Australian society.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 July 2023 regarding petition EN4387 to remove the prohibition of nuclear power. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>The Australian Government has no plans to change the longstanding moratorium on nuclear power in Australia, which is prohibited by law under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The high cost and long deployment time of nuclear power makes it an unviable choice for Australia. The GenCost 2022-23 Report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), shows that renewables are the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and cheaper to operate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Putting downwards pressure on electricity prices is why we are focused on transforming our electricity system so that more renewable energy powers our homes. Under the Rewiring the Nation policy, we are investing $20 billion to upgrade our electricity grid to ensure it can support the boost needed in renewable energy generation. In addition, we are investing in the Capacity Investment Scheme, which will deliver at least 6 GW of dispatchable capacity, boosting reliability and putting downward pressure on prices. We are also investing $100 million in solar banks and $200 million in new community batteries to help more people access solar and maximise the benefits of Australia's energy transformation.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence received on 25 July 2023, regarding a petition presented in the House of Representatives on 7 November 2022 (EN4390) related to raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to note that several jurisdictions have made progress on raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility including the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. While State and Territory governments are responsible for the administration of youth justice systems, the Australian Government is playing a leadership role in working with the States and Territories on this issue through the Standing Council of Attorneys-General (SCAG).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In August 2022 I put the minimum age of criminal responsibility on the SCAG agenda and all participants agreed to reconvene the Age of Criminal Responsibility Working Group (the Working Group) to continue to develop a proposal to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility in Australia, paying particular attention to eliminating the overrepresentation of First Nations' children in the criminal justice system. At the December 2022 SCAG, Attorneys-General agreed to release a draft report on the minimum age of criminal responsibility prepared by a previous iteration of the Working Group for the then Council of Attorneys-General in 2020. The report was not agreed to by all jurisdictions, nor was it provided to the Council of Attorneys-General for consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The reconvened Working Group has been considering complex issues associated with raising the age, including exploring alternative therapeutic service system design, and ensuring there are mechanisms in place to adequately support children who are diverted away from the criminal justice system. The Working Group delivered a report on this work to SCAG at its meeting on 22 September 2023. The Government is considering the report.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers language education an important part of a student's education, celebrating Australia's multicultural society. The Australian Curriculum, which sets high expectations and standards for what all students should know and be able to do, underwent a comprehensive review in 2021, and was endorsed by all state and territory governments in April 2022. This review included consultation on the Languages learning area, which resulted in a more streamlined language curriculum. As such, there are no current plans to add more languages into the Australian Curriculum at this stage. Further information on the updated Australian Curriculum is available at www.v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government plays a national leadership role in school education, under the Australian Constitution, state and territory government and non-government education authorities are responsible for the implementation of the Curriculum within their jurisdictions, including determining which languages are taught within their schools.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Punjabi is not one of 14 languages taught under the Australian Curriculum, jurisdictions may still choose to add Punjabi to their state-based curriculum or school language programs, as is the case in New South Wales. Further information is available at www.educationstandards.nsw.edu.au. The petitioner may wish to contact their state or territory Education Minister to discuss their addition of Punjabi to the jurisdiction's school curriculum.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 March 2023 referring petition EN4769 about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice referendum. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The referendum is about the principle of recognising First Nations people in the Constitution through establishing a Voice. The Voice design principles provide a framework for the development of the Voice. After a successful referendum, the Government would commence a process to design the Voice including consultation through a Joint Parliamentary Committee co-chaired by the Government and the Opposition. The Voice's composition, functions, powers and procedures will be a matter for the Parliament to legislate. Leaving the specifics to legislation would ensure the Voice is able to evolve and adapt as circumstances change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The referendum question and constitutional amendment were introduced into Parliament through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) Bill 2023 </span>on 30 March 2023. A Joint Parliamentary Committee Inquiry, which included consideration of public submissions, recommended the Bill pass without amendment. The Committee was provided with a submission from the Attorney-General, the Hon Mark Dreyfus KC MP. This submission contained advice from the Solicitor-General, which stated that "the proposed amendment is not only compatible with the system of representative and responsible government established under the Constitution, but it enhances that system".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill was passed without amendment on 19 June 2023. If passed on 14 October 2023, the referendum would insert a new section, section 129, into the Constitution. I have enclosed a copy of the referendum question and proposed constitutional amendment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There has been over a decade of discussion and consultation about constitutional recognition, driven by the efforts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This process has included expert panels, parliamentary committees, the Kirribilli Statement, the publication of the Uluru Statement from the Heart following the conclusion of the Uluru Dialogues, and the Indigenous Voice Co-design process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government undertook significant consultation when developing the Bill, including consultation with constitutional experts. Following this robust consultation process, changes were made to the draft constitutional provision, including to make clear the primacy of Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Electric Vehicles</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring a copy of petition EN4880 presented to the House of Representatives on 9 May 2023 regarding providing financial incentives for Australians to convert internal combustion engines (ICE) of existing vehicles to electric motors. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the idea of providing financial incentives to convert existing ICE cars into electric cars, however, my Department advises retrofitting ICE vehicles to electric cars is not cost- effective as it involves the replacement of several vehicle components, and requires a range of safety and training issues to be addressed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has already announced a range of initiatives to support the uptake of EVs including the Electric Car Discount that reduces the upfront costs associated with purchasing an EV. The Government's $500 million Driving the Nation Fund more than doubles the Commonwealth's investment in EV charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, including in regional and remote parts of the country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In April 2023, the Government released its first National Electric Vehicle Strategy. The Strategy provides a nationally consistent, comprehensive framework to consider supply, demand, and infrastructure needs for cleaner and cheaper vehicles in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the heart of the Strategy is the Government's commitment to introduce a fuel efficiency standard. Introducing a mandatory light vehicle fuel efficiency standard will encourage car manufacturers to supply more electric vehicles and low emission vehicles to Australia, improving consumer choice and making it easier and cheaper to access popular electric vehicle models. Over time, a fuel efficiency standard will also help make all vehicles on the road more efficient, with new petrol and diesel cars likely to use less fuel, saving Australians money and reducing emissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring that design of the fuel efficiency standard balances emissions reductions with economic benefits. The Government is currently considering the input from more than 2,500 submissions that were received as part of consultation on fuel efficiency standards undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A fuel efficiency standard will require fresh legislation to be put to the Australian Parliament. The Government is aiming to release an Impact Analysis in the coming months and a proposed fuel efficiency standard model by the end of 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing your concerns to the Government's attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

While the timing of elections in Pakistan is a matter for relevant Pakistan authorities, we encourage Pakistan to conduct timely elections that are free, fair and credible and in accordance with the constitution.</span>

We regularly engages with all sides of politics, including through our High Commission in Pakistan. The Australian Government regularly raises human rights directly with the Government of Pakistan, including to underscore the importance of freedom of expression and of association, foster tolerance, and strengthen civil society and its institutions. We also continue to raise our concerns internationally, including at the United Nations Human Rights Council.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Australian Constitution: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 21 June 2023 referring petition EN5059 about the referendum on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2023 referendum will give us the opportunity to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in our Constitution through a Voice. The Government is committed to holding the referendum to allow Australians to vote on this significant reform.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 19 June 2023 the Parliament passed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) Bill 2023 </span>without amendment. The Bill has paved the way for a referendum to be held in accordance with section 128 of the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 September 2023, the Governor-General, General David Hurley issued a writ to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, Mr Tom Rodgers instructing the Australian Electoral Commission to hold a referendum on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice on 14 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill has been extensively scrutinised by some of the best legal minds in the country, including the Constitutional Expert Group and the Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue KC. The Solicitor-General has advised that The Voice is 'not just compatible with the system of representative and responsible government prescribed by the Constitution, but an enhancement of that system'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently 11 First Nations Members of Parliament and Senators. However, there is no guarantee this will remain the same in the next term or the term after that. Structural change is needed to ensure First Nations people are always heard on the policies that affect them, which will lead to better outcomes. A constitutionally enshrined Voice provides a permanent means of providing advice to the Parliament and the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Constitutional Expert Group advising Government has made clear the Voice will be an advisory body and will not provide special rights to First Nations people, nor would it change or remove any rights, powers or privileges of anyone who is not Indigenous. The Voice will not come at the expense of cost-of-living relief.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 regarding petition EN5091 on the Australian Government's decision to increase maximum dispensing quantities for some medications listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian pharmacies already do much more than just dispense medicines, and the Government wants our trusted pharmacists to play an even bigger role in the healthcare of Australians. That is why every dollar saved by the Government through fewer dispensing payments will be re-invested back into community pharmacy, to support these highly trained professionals to deliver expanded services, and better recognise pharmacists' scope of practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This reinvestment will go towards increasing the total budget for Community Pharmacy Programs under the Seventh Community Pharmacy Agreement from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Already, as part of the 2023-24 Budget, the Government has ensured patients will have continued access to medication management and dose administration aids with funding for community pharmacy programs increased ($654.9 million over four years).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the money saved will be invested to fund a nationally consistent Opioid Dependence Treatment Program ($377.3 million over four years), which commenced on 1 July 2023, and means these patients now only pay the relevant PBS co-payment for these medicines. This funding is in addition to the funding pharmacists will receive for dispensing these medicines on the PBS under the Section 100 Highly Specialised Drugs Community Access Program. The Government estimates participating pharmacists will receive between $175 to $191 per patient per month under these new arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also expand funding for pharmacists to administer vaccines under the National Immunisation Program ($114.1 million over four years). From 1 January 2024, pharmacists will receive a payment of $18.85 per vaccine administered at no cost to the patient—the same amount a GP receives for a Level A Consultation for this same service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmacy stakeholders have asked successive Governments for remuneration of these services to be at the same level as GPs. This initiative replaces current vaccination services where patients' need to self-fund the service. Vaccines that can be administered by a pharmacist are determined by relevant state and territory legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further support is also being made available to pharmacies in regional, rural, and remote Australia through the doubling of the budget for the Regional Pharmacy Maintenance Allowance from 1 July 2023. This is expected to mean a significant increase in funding for over 1,000 community pharmacies in regional, rural and remote areas across Australia ($79.5 million over four years).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also recently announced further support for regional, rural and remote pharmacies with the introduction of the Regional Pharmacy Transition Allowance ($148.2 million over four years) to assist pharmacies in transitioning their business arrangement to adapt to maximum dispensing quantities. When considered in conjunction with the Regional Pharmacy Maintenance Allowance, the total assistance of these two programs is expected to mean that eligible pharmacies in Monash Model 3-7 locations will, on average, largely have dispensing related remuneration reductions due to implementation of the 60-Day dispensing policy, mostly offset in 2023-24.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health and Aged Care acknowledges the modelling commissioned by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia in relation to the 60-day dispensing reforms. The report suggests that at least 665 pharmacies will close across Australia. This is based on a 'Central Scenario' with uptake ranging from 63% in 2023-24 to 90% in 2026-27. Department modelling has uptake ranging from 45% in 2023-24 to 63% in 2026-27.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This central scenario modelling from Ergas suggests a significantly more aggressive uptake of 60 Day dispensing. The central scenario modelled by Ergas suggests a reduction in dispensing related remuneration of $4.5 billion over four years (Government and patient combined). This is 1.5 times higher than the Government modelled costs of $3 billion over four years (Government and patient combined). The report also includes a reduction in other retail sales estimated to be around, on average, $20. Retail sales are independent to Government remuneration for dispensing related activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We understand that pharmacies are profit-making businesses, and they have to consider their bottom line. The Government is committed to a vibrant community pharmacy sector in Australia, with a growing role for pharmacy in primary healthcare, and will continue to consider options available to it to support community pharmacy as they transition their business arrangements to account for this new policy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, as announced on 7 August 2023, negotiations for the Eight Community Pharmacy Agreement (8CPA) will soon commence. The 8CPA will support patient access to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidised medicines, programs, and related services through community pharmacies across Australia. Negotiations will commence as soon as possible and are expected to conclude by 30 June 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 enclosing Petition EN5093, with 265 signatures, concerning the increase to the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 April 2023 I announced that the TSMIT would be raised to $70,000 from 1 July 2023. The increase in TSMIT took effect from 1 July 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TSMIT applies to key employer sponsored visas: the Temporary Skill Shortage (subclass 482) visa, the Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (subclass 494) visa, the Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186) visa, and the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (subclass 187) visa. Sponsoring employers in these programs are required to pay the higher of the TSMIT or the annual market salary rate for the skilled position they nominate to be filled with a worker from overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is the first increase to the TSMIT since 2013. The new $70,000 income threshold is approximately where the TSMIT would have been if it had been indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings growth over the previous 10 years. Increasing the TSMIT ensures that our skilled visa programs are targeted at highly skilled workers who are less open to exploitation. It is also intended b ensure migrants entering Australia under these programs have sufficient income to support themselves and their families, noting that temporary migrants have limited or no access to social security payments and face a higher cost of living than Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the increase may raise concerns in some sectors and in regional Australia, however, the new TSMIT income threshold appropriately reflects growth in Australian wages since it was last adjusted in 2013.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition is particularly concerned with the effect of a changed TSMIT on applicants for Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) (subclass 491) visas and the pathway to permanent residence for holders of those visas. Eligible holders of subclass 491 visas and Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) (subclass 494) visas have a pathway to the Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) (subclass 191) visa in the Regional Provisional Stream.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There has been no change to the income requirement for the subclass 191 visa. However, advice on the website of the Department of Home Affairs has been updated to clarify the requirements of the subclass 191 visa including:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 presenting Petition EN5115—<span style="font-style:italic;">Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena {UAP). </span>I have considered the matters raised in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition requests the House conduct a formal review of UAP to consider the establishment of an investigatory body to assess the potential national security threats and safety of flight risks that UAP pose.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As acknowledged in the petition, Defence ceased handling reports of UAP in 1996 as there was no scientific or compelling reason to continue to divert resources to the recording and investigation of UAP.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the establishment of the United States All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), and Defence monitors AARO reports. There are no plans to replicate a similar mechanism.</span>

              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding Parliamentary Petition EN5125 seeking amendment to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 </span>(VEA) in relation to governance for the Repatriation Medical Authority's (RMA) consideration of "sound medical-scientific evidence" (SMSE).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners' view that the VEA "…<span style="font-style:italic;">fails to provide governance ensuring all SMSE used by the RMA has been generated in a manner which reflects community qualities, standards and expectations in such areas as safety and ethics". </span>I also understand the petition to be contending that this could be addressed by giving the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC), through the National Safety and Quality Health Service (NSQHS) Standards, a legislated role to examine all information to ensure it is in accordance with the National Clinical Trials Governance Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The following information about the respective roles of the RMA and the ACSQHC may assist the Committee in its consideration of this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its function, the RMA assesses the quality of scientific literature. In conducting its investigations, the RMA uses articles found in medical literature databases such as PubMed, which is created by the US National Library of Medicine. The National Library of Medicine has a process to determine whether the scientific and editorial character and quality of a journal merit its inclusion in MEDLINE. MEDLINE's Scientific Quality Review is a rigorous, multi-step process in which many factors are assessed. The criteria for inclusion include conformity with ethical guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RMA assesses the SMSE, and includes causal factors for medical conditions in the legislative instruments which it administers, known as Statements of Principles, where this is supported by the scientific studies which it has considered. As part of its responsibilities, the RMA periodically reviews the Statements of Principles to ensure that they remain consistent with the latest SMSE.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACSQHC's work is predominately in the field of health care safety and quality, including the development of national standards and the maintenance of accreditation schemes. The RMA is not a health care provider and does not itself undertake research to which health care standards or guidelines apply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposal would require significant changes to the legislation under which the RMA operates. Creating an additional body to review the sound medical scientific evidence that the RMA had already deemed suitable to include in the overall body of evidence used for an investigation, would add additional processes and potentially increase timelines for completing a Statement of Principles investigation. This is because the RMA would have to delay its final conclusions whilst the oversight body approved the articles used for the investigation and then potentially redo the causal analysis using a smaller pool of evidence. This could work to the detriment of veterans if there was new scientific evidence that may lead to changes to the Statements of Principles, as it would delay their implementation into the legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It would likely not be in the interests of the veteran community to create an additional oversight body that could exclude scientific evidence that might lead to the creation of a Statement of Principles factor linking a condition to Defence service. Therefore, there are no plans to adopt the suggestion raised in Petition EN5125.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition <span style="font-weight:bold;">EN5</span>144 on -requiring financial institutions to outline potential risks associated with joint bank accounts and loans to minimise impacts of domestic abuse. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government welcomes the public's views and appreciates the consideration that has been given to this matter. The Government treats matters of domestic abuse seriously and has taken strong action to address this important matter. On 17 October 2022, the Australian, state and territory governments released the <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032. </span>The National Plan commits governments to partner and implement sustained actions to end violence against women and children in one generation, including action to address economic and financial abuse.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Government provided $589.3 million to further support women's safety, including implementation of the National Plan. This was in addition to the $1.7 billion for women's safety announced in the 2022-23 October Budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To reach the National Plan's vision of ending gender-based violence in a generation, sustained and collective action is needed across society. Financial regulators and banks are addressing family and domestic violence:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> In July 2023, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission provided a 'no action position' to enable large banks participating in the mandatory comprehensive credit reporting regime to not supply mandatory credit information and withhold notices to joint account holders in family violence situations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> The Australian Banking Association (ABA) has guidelines about preventing and responding to family and domestic violence, as well as general financial abuse that outlines the procedures and remedies banks should have in place to respond to indications or occurrences of these types of abuse. Banks have also introduced targeted measures to address this issue, implementing technological solutions to identify and block transactions with abusive descriptions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> The ABA is introducing a revised Banking Code of Conduct that includes an expanded definition of 'vulnerability', which recognises that a person's circumstances may require specific types of support, and that these circumstances may change over time.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organization (WHO) is, and remains, a Member State led organisation. Under international law, Member States such as Australia retain sovereignty regarding their public health policies. The WHO has no legal authority to force countries to accept any of its recommendations, and can only provide aid and assistance at Member States' request. The Australian law can only be changed by an act of the Parliament, not by any international treaty or other legal instrument.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is dedicated to strengthening national and global pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response and is committed to working with the Australian public and the international community to be better prepared for the next pandemic. As referred to in the Ministerial Petition referenced above, one of the major reforms through the WHO currently being considered is the development of a new international instrument on pandemic preparedness, prevention and response. This process will work to close gaps identified through independent reviews of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The intent of the new instrument is to strengthen the international community's efforts in preventing, preparing for, and responding to, future pandemics. The new instrument provides an opportunity to reduce the risk and impact of health threats, such as that posed by COVID-19, by strengthening global health systems and disease surveillance, while enhancing equity and future pandemic response. Australia is actively engaged in the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), which is drafting and negotiating the new instrument. For more information about the work of the INB, please visit the WHO at https://apps.who.int/gb/inb/.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Work is underway to ensure this negotiation process aligns with the Government priorities and the national interest. The Government will consult widely across government, with Australian stakeholders and the community throughout negotiations to ensure Australians and our region's interests are preserved and our priorities advanced.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any new instrument will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT). As part of its process in scrutinising proposed treaties, JSCOT undertakes further consultation by inviting submissions from stakeholders and members of the public. Any changes to the Australian law to implement the new instrument would also have to be considered and passed by Parliament.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, Australia has a federal system of government and responsibilities for making laws are shared across the Commonwealth, states and territories, and local government. This includes laws regulating conversion practices.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no national policies or laws aimed at preventing or prohibiting conversion practices, I note Victoria, Queensland, and the ACT have all passed legislation to ban conversion practices, and Tasmania, NSW, South Australia and Western Australia are considering legislation on this issue.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) works in partnership with health practitioner regulation national boards (National Boards) to regulate registered health professions under the oversight of all Australian Health Ministers.

The Action Plan will be informed by national consultation with LGBTIQA+ people, an Expert Advisory Group, and the lived experience of LGBTIQA+ people and their families, and community organisations.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding petition number EN5212, which proposes legislating overtime rates for working outside of scheduled hours.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's workplace relations system has important protections for working hours, rostering, and overtime. Under the National Employment Standards in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>an employer cannot request or require an employee to work more than 38 hours in a week, unless the additional hours are reasonable. Reasonableness includes considering health and safety risks and the employee's personal circumstances, including family responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Modern awards and agreements set out the maximum ordinary hours that can be worked and rules for when overtime rates apply. The independent Fair Work Commission (FWC) is responsible for setting award standards. Employers, employees, and organisations representing their industrial interests, can apply to vary an award. Further information is available on the FWC website at www.fwc.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the critical importance of ensuring Australian workers are appropriately remunerated and is committed to protecting Australian workers from exploitation. That is why the Government has introduced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. </span>If passed, this Bill would make it a criminal offence for employers to intentionally underpay their employees' wages, including overtime, as well as increasing the maximum civil penalties for underpayment-related breaches.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I can understand concerns about the inappropriate use of agricultural chemicals. Protecting human health is the Australian Government's top priority. In Australia, agricultural and veterinary (agvet) chemicals, which includes pesticides such as glyphosate (the active ingredient in the herbicide product Roundup), are regulated under a cooperative scheme between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. This ensures that controls are in place on both supply (Commonwealth responsibility) and at the point of use (state and territory responsibility) to deliver safety for the Australian public and environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) is the independent national regulator that assesses and registers agricultural chemicals before they can be supplied in Australia. The APVMA's assessments are evidence based and look at the entire suite of toxicology studies to determine the likely impacts on human health, animals, crops and the environment. The APVMA approves label instructions for the safe use of all registered chemical products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the registration process, the APVMA establishes maximum residue limits (MRLs) that apply to plant and animal produce destined for human consumption. An MRL is the highest residue concentration legally permitted in a food for sale and reflects the maximum level that could be present, as a result of the registered conditions of use for that chemical." The MRLs established in Australia are set well below the level that would be harmful to consumers and are based on good agricultural practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APVMA assesses the food safety for the consumer by assessing trial data on all proposed use patterns, including all methods and timing of application, to quantify the potential residues from that use in food. Once the APVMA has assessed the expected residues from a proposed use, it assesses the potential dietary exposure as a proportion of the Australian Health Based Guidance Values to ensure the use pattern is safe. All residues and dietary exposure assessments are conducted in accordance with internationally accepted OECD methods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APVMA has assessed the residues in food resulting from approved label uses of glyphosate products, including use as a harvest aid. Glyphosate is approved as a harvest aid for a number of crops including barley, wheat, canola, various oilseeds and pulses. Depending on the use pattern, restrictions on the timing of treatment and harvest withholding periods apply. The APVMA is satisfied of the safety of registered glyphosate-containing products and will continue to permit use as a harvest aid according to label directions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APVMA evaluated a range of contemporary scientific information about glyphosate in 2016. The review found that, in Australia, when glyphosate is used in accordance with the label instructions it does not pose a cancer risk to humans—including to persons consuming food with glyphosate residues below the MRL—and is unlikely to have harmful effects on human beings or the environment. The report can be found at apvma.gov.au/node/13891. The APVMA continues to monitor international and scientific developments across the full suite of products within its remit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is an independent statutory authority responsible for the development and maintenance of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code), which sets out the legal requirements, including labelling requirements, for food produced or imported for sale in Australia and New Zealand. The Code can be accessed at foodstandards.gov.au/code/Pages/default.aspx.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code does not require agricultural or veterinary chemical residues to be declared on the label of food products. This is because the concentration of such residues must legally be below the MRLs, which are established safe limits. Therefore, the Australian Government does not, and does not intend to, mandate labels on foods regarding glyphosate concentrations below permitted MRLs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of Australian-based MRLs that apply to imported food is mediated by FSANZ, through the MRL harmonisation proposal process. MRLs are listed in Standard 1.4.2 (Maximum Residue Limits) of the Code. If an MRL for an agricultural or veterinary chemical is not listed in Standard 1.4.2 of the Code, there must be no detectable residues of that chemical in the food.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5226 which requests legislation to mandate that businesses operating in Australia accept all forms of legal tender. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A refusal to accept legal tender banknotes or coins is not unlawful. Providers of goods and services can specify what forms of payment they will accept prior to entering into a contract or transaction. If a provider specifies other means of payment prior to the contract or transaction, then there is no obligation for legal tender banknotes or coins to be accepted as payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Cash is an important payment method, particularly for certain groups in Australia, and plays a vital role in their inclusion in the wider economy. Cash is still widely accepted as a means of payment by merchants, used as a store of value, and provides resilience to the payments system during outages where digital forms of money cannot be used.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 June 2023 the Government released its 'Strategic plan for the Australian Payments System', which outlines the Government's intentions for payment systems in Australia. The plan states the Government's commitment to maintaining adequate access to cash for all Australians.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5228 on the provision of subsidies to encourage people to use gas cooking appliances in order to take pressure off the electricity grid.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government has no plans to provide subsidies to encourage further take up of gas cooking appliances, the government has announced a $1.3 billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund in the 2023 24 Budget. This includes $1 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to partner with banks and other lenders to offer low-cost loans to upgrade homes with battery-ready solar PV and modem energy-efficient appliances. This will help more than 110,000 households lower their energy bills and take pressure off the electricity grid.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is also unlocking investment in the electricity grid through its Rewiring the Nation program. This program will deliver $20 billion of investment to modernise the grid and implement the Australian Energy Market Operator's Integrated System Plan (ISP), driving down power prices and reducing emissions by boosting renewable energy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are also investing to increase the capacity of the electricity grid through the Capacity Investment Scheme, which will support at least 6 GW of new dispatchable electricity generation capacity to boost reliability of electricity supply.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's role in regulating CSG projects is in relation to matters of national environmental significance protected under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act), such as listed threatened species and ecological communities, World and National Heritage places, and water resources in relation to CSG and large coal mines. The management of other environmental aspects of CSG projects is regulated by state governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For CSG projects approved under the EPBC Act, strict conditions have been applied which require the development and implementation of a CSG water management strategy to ensure the disposal of salt/brine waste is safely managed. Waste storage and disposal facilities, including for salt, are primarily regulated by the Queensland state government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding the specific disposal site referenced near Chinchilla, it is the responsibility of the proponent to refer their proposal for assessment under the EPBC Act if a significant impact on nationally protected matters is likely. My department has contacted the proponent and informed them of their obligation to refer the action if it is likely to have a significant impact on nationally protected matters. It remains the responsibility of the proponent to comply with the requirements of the EPBC Act.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition EN5233 requesting the House to pause the use of Pfizer and Moderna Sars-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines nationwide immediately so that new data can be evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and appropriate bodies. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that the petitioners are very concerned about COVID-19 vaccine-related safety, however, there is no credible evidence that there is an unacceptable risk with the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The TGA, part of the Department of Health and Aged Care, currently implements extensive surveillance and safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the Australian population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although these vaccines initially received provisional approval, the TGA approved the transition of Moderna's monovalent Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine from provisional to full registration on 21 April 2023, and Pfizer's monovalent Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine on 13 July 2023. This means that they are now fully approved for use and supply in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In making this decision, the TGA carefully considered confirmatory long term follow up data, cumulative of clinical studies and post authorisation clinical effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety data. Further, the decision to grant full registration was informed by expert advice from the Advisory Committee on Vaccines, an independent committee with expertise in scientific, medical, and clinical fields that also has consumer representation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As background, all COVID-19 vaccines have been approved via the provisional approval pathway because of the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. I assure you that the TGA has comprehensively evaluated each of the provisionally registered COVID-19 vaccines to ensure that they meet Australia's high standards of safety, quality, and efficacy. These vaccines have received the same high level of scrutiny as other prescription medicines and vaccines. Although use of this pathway balances the benefits in enabling earlier access against the potential risks inherent in the fact that additional data is required, it does not release the sponsor from having to provide extensive and accurate assessment information to support the safety and efficacy of their product. As part of the provisional approval, sponsors are also required to continue to submit longer term evidence to the TGA. Data from ongoing trials can support an application to transition to full registration status if the sponsor chooses to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following approval of a vaccine, the TGA undertakes post-market surveillance. Many of these processes have been enhanced for COVID-19 vaccines making this the most intensive safety monitoring of therapeutic goods ever conducted in Australia. When investigations identify new safety information, the TGA takes prompt regulatory action. Additionally, the TGA reviews all deaths reported in people post-administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. Their analysis of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest that the vaccines played a causal role in most of these cases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions relating to the vaccination program are based on the expert clinical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), which comprises experts in infectious disease, immunisation, primary care, and public health. The ATAGI closely monitors local and international epidemiological data in relation to COVID-19 and vaccines and meet frequently to consider emerging evidence and information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccination against COVID-19 is the most effective way to reduce severe illness, hospitalisation, and death from infection. Evidence from more than 13 billion vaccine doses given worldwide shows that COVID-19 vaccines have a very good safety profile in all age groups.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 regarding Petition EN5268 in which signatories outlined concerns about the use of toxins for the control of vertebrate pest animals, specifically feral cats and foxes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recently released for public consultation an updated threat abatement plan for predation from feral cats. This plan includes the appropriate and controlled use of toxins to limit harms to our unique and threatened native species.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is one of the most biodiverse countries on earth. Unfortunately, Australia also holds the unenviable record of having lost more mammal species than any other continent. Feral cats and foxes are, in large part, responsible for these and many other species becoming extinct—and cats threaten more than 200 federally-listed threatened species.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Feral cats are present across 99.9 per cent of the country- they are absent only on some islands and fenced areas from which they are specifically excluded. Each year feral cats kill more than 1.5 billion native animals. Some of our rarest native species, like the Kyloring (Western ground parrot) are being kept alive only because of cat and fox baiting programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Signatories to the petition are concerned about the potential for non-target species to ingest toxins (either directly or by consuming carrion) and for environmental contamination. I understand these concerns but can reassure petitioners that 1080 is broken down quickly in the environment and that baiting programs are carefully tailored to the target species in order to minimise impacts on other species. More targeted than traditional baiting, the Felixer grooming trap deploys a gel squirt of toxin only when its artificial intelligence recognises a passing cat, avoiding non-target impacts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At a population scale, there have been many scientific studies which have considered the risks of 1080 poison on native animals, including 29 species of native birds, seven species of native reptiles and amphibians and 44 species of native mammals (including carnivorous marsupials). All these studies have found that there is no threat from 1080 poison to populations of these wildlife species.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Governments will continue to ensure that control methods for feral cats and foxes are as humane, effective and targeted as possible and to look for more and better ways to save our native species.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my notice.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the ongoing community concerns about the harms associated with online gambling.

The current priority of the Government for online gambling is harm minimisation and to deliver consumer protection measures that are aligned with community expectations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 September 2022, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs launched an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. The Committee examined a range of issues, including the effectiveness of current gambling advertising restrictions, and regulatory and licensing regimes around online gambling.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee handed down its final report on 28 June 2023 and the Government is now considering the Committee's 31 recommendations.

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">BetStop, the National Self-Exclusion Register: On 21 August 2023, the Government launched BetStop, the National Self-Exclusion Register, which allows individuals experiencing gambling harms to exclude themselves from Australian licensed online wagering services for three months, up to a lifetime. The Government has also introduced mandatory customer pre-verification requirements to open a betting account. Pre-verification will ensure protection for underage or self-excluded customers from accessing online gambling services.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> Banning credit betting: on 13 September 2023, I introduced in the House of Representatives the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Credit and Other Measures) Bill 2023, which would ban the use of credit cards for online wagering.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Consistent gambling messaging: new evidence-based gambling taglines were introduced on 30 March 2023 to replace 'gamble responsibly' and must accompany all gambling advertisements that appear online, as well as on TV and radio.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Classification: on 29 March 2023, the Government announced proposed improvements to the National Classification Scheme to address concerns about gambling-like content in video games.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GenCost 2022-23 Report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), shows renewables are the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and cheaper to operate, making nuclear power an unviable choice for Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Putting downwards pressure on electricity prices is why we are focused on transforming our electricity system so that more renewable energy powers our homes. Under the government's Powering Australia plan, we are investing $20 billion through Rewiring the Nation to upgrade our electricity grid to ensure it can support the boost needed in renewable energy generation. We are also supporting 6 GW of dispatchable renewable capacity investment through the Capacity Investment Scheme, investing $100 million in solar banks and $200 million in new community batteries to help more people access solar and maximise the benefits of Australia's energy transformation.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring a copy of petition EN5297 presented to the House of Representatives on 11 September 2023 regarding imposing a responsibility on public electric vehicle (EV) charger owners to ensure operational chargers. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the reasoning of petitioners and I am sympathetic to the matters they raise. However, the Government is not considering introducing retrospective fines for EV charger operators. Instead, the Government is committed to working with all levels of government and industry to build a customer-focused EV charging ecosystem in Australia that is convenient, reliable and equitable. The needs of Australian motorists are a central consideration for Government in designing future policy to support the decarbonisation of Australia's transport sector, including policies to support EV charging infrastructure and overcome range anxiety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of our Powering Australia plan to improve affordability, create jobs and reduce emissions, the Australian Government has developed Australia's first National Electric Vehicle Strategy. The Strategy provides a nationally consistent, comprehensive framework to consider supply, demand, and infrastructure needs for cleaner and cheaper vehicles in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy builds on the progress made across Australia in supporting EV uptake. It includes an agreement to work across jurisdictions on six key areas of collaboration—including national standards; and remote and regional EV charging infrastructure. As part of this work, we are collaborating to establish minimum operating standards for government-funded public EV charging infrastructure. Availability and accessibility are some of the key factors being considered as part of these standards to ensure EV drivers can travel with confidence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to collaborating across jurisdictions, the Government is investing $39.3 million through the Driving the Nation Fund, matched by the NRMA to deliver 117 new public fast chargers on national highways. Priority will be given to known EV charging blackspots, particularly in rural and remote areas. Specifications include reliability targets to ensure this network is accessible and well maintained.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 September 2023, presenting petition number EN5299, asking the Federal and State Governments of Australia to ban hydraulic fracturing. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to delivering Australia's energy transformation alongside strong climate action. Gas will continue to be a key fuel as we transform our energy system, providing the flexibility we need to add more renewables to the grid. Gas is essential for energy security, stability, and reliability both domestically and across the Asia-Pacific. Australian gas, exported as liquefied natural gas, is critical to our trading partners' own net zero plans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is strongly committed to protecting our environment and enforcing safe and environmentally sustainable practices by the oil and gas sector, now and into the future. Onshore gas developments are subject to rigorous environmental approvals processes across state, territory, and commonwealth regulatory bodies. As Australia's states and territories regulate onshore gas development, changes to these regulatory settings is a matter for the relevant jurisdiction. Offshore gas developments are regulated by Australia's independent expert regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, where a gas development could impact a matter of national environmental significance, it is assessed under our national environment law, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act). On 8 December 2022, the Government released its Response to the Independent Review of the EPBC Act. In this response, we indicated our intention to strengthen environmental protections in relation to hydraulic fracturing by expanding the coverage of the EPBC's water trigger to all forms of unconventional gas extraction. The response can be reviewed here:    <br clear="all">.</br>dcceew.gov.au/environment/epbc/publications/nature-positive-plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Over the past decade successive Australian governments have supported a number of scientific studies examining the potential impacts of gas development on water resources and the environment. Independent scientific assessments by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">CSIRO </span>and Geoscience Australia into hydraulic fracturing have found with high confidence that potential impacts can be mitigated through ongoing compliance with existing regulatory and management controls. The findings can be viewed at www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The role of gas is changing as Australia and the rest of the world decarbonises. I am leading the development of a Future Gas Strategy to help us plan for and support Australia, and our region's, transition to net zero. To develop the Strategy, I welcome feedback from anyone with an interest in the future of gas. I encourage the petitioners to contribute to the development of the Future Gas Strategy. Information on how to contribute can be found at www.industry.gov.au/mining-oil-and-gas/oil-and-gas/planning-gas-2050.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Labor Government understands the importance of safe and affordable housing for all Australians. In 2023-24, this Government expects to spend around $5.5 billion in CRA to assist households receiving income support to pay their rent and around $1.7 billion through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to assist states and territories to deliver social housing and homelessness services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">CRA is an important component of the income support and family payment systems. It contributes to the improvement of housing affordability and complements broader income support objectives by assisting individuals and families with the additional costs associated with renting in the private market and in community housing. CRA is not intended to reimburse recipients for the full cost of their private rent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Security of tenure is one of the significant benefits of owning a home, which is why CRA is not extended to home owners. There are other concessions in the social security system for home owners. For example, the value of a person's principal home is not taken into account in working out the amount of pension or benefit they can receive. If the value of a person's home was treated in the same way as other assets, such as bank accounts or shares, many home owners will receive far less in pensions or benefits than is currently the case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Home owner pensioners can still receive a range of concessions, including subsidised prescription medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and subsidised health care and related products. State and territory governments and some private providers also offer Pensioner Concession Card holders discounts on other goods and services, such as utility bills and public transport.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Labor Government has committed to an ambitious housing reform agenda which will boost the supply of all housing—more public and social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy. This includes:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter containing petition EN5316 regarding the security situation and its negative impacts on the population in Kurram district in Pakistan.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the significant security challenges faced by Pakistan, including in Kurram and surrounding districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. These areas have been host to long-running insurgency groups hostile to Pakistan. Most of Kybher Pakhtunkhwa and neighbouring Balochistan province are listed as 'Do not travel' destinations in the Australian Government's travel advice due to the volatile security situation and ongoing threat of terrorist attacks, kidnapping and violence.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has longstanding defence, law enforcement and institutional ties with Pakistan, and engages with Pakistani counterparts on security matters. We condemn terrorism and continue to stand with Pakistan in its fight against regional and global terror groups.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also urges relevant authorities to improve governance and development outcomes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Over the past decade Australia has made a significant contribution towards development in the province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), through development cooperation in the areas of education, governance and service delivery, and women's empowerment.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 September 2023 regarding Petition EN5321—Pay research students a living wage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Research plays a critical role in Australia, driving innovation and improving our quality of life. The Australian Government acknowledges the invaluable work higher degree by research (HDR) students undertake to support and advance Australia's research and knowledge base, and welcomes their views and opinions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Research Training Program (RTP) stipend is a scholarship awarded by universities for the purposes of students' education. It is specifically designed to support HDR students and is not considered as income for employment or employment related activities. It is therefore not linked to any benchmarks such as the National Minimum Wage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Commonwealth Scholarships Guidelines (Research) 2017 (Guidelines), universities have discretion to award RTP stipend rates within a base and maximum range. In 2023, the full-time base RTP stipend rate is $29,863 and the maximum rate is $46,653. In 2024, the full-time base RTP stipend rate will be $32,192, and the maximum rate will be $50,291. The range acknowledges that universities are best placed to determine the stipend rates that will enable them to achieve their research training priorities and meet the needs of their HDR students. The stipend rates offered by universities varies, and many exercise their discretion to raise their rates above the full-time base rate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Guidelines also stipulate that RTP stipend recipients are entitled to various types of leave. This includes paid recreation and sick leave for each year of RTP stipend support. Recipients who have completed at least 12 months of their HDR while in receipt of an RTP stipend are also entitled to paid maternity leave or a period of paid parenting leave (subject to the usual practices of the university).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Universities Accord (the Accord) process is reviewing Australia's higher education system and is considering a range of issues for research and research training policy settings, including those that attract and support HDR students. The Accord Panel has provided its Interim Report, with a final report due to be delivered to Government by December 2023. Further information about the Accord, including the Interim Report, is available on the Department of Education's website at www.education.gov.au/australian-universities-accord.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 5 September 2023 concerning Petition EN5323, seeking a legislated end date for the phase out of live sheep exports by sea. The Australian Government acknowledges the considerable community concerns about animal welfare in the trade of live sheep exports by sea and understands the desire to see action.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government took the commitment to phase out live sheep exports by sea to two elections, and it is my intention to deliver on this commitment in an orderly and considered way, and in consultation with affected stakeholders. The phase out will not take place during this term of the Australian Parliament to give time for individuals and businesses to prepare for a transition away from live sheep exports by sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Earlier this year I appointed a four-person, Independent Panel to provide advice on timing and the mechanism for implementing the phase out of live sheep exports by sea. The Independent Panel has undertaken an extensive consultation process and is now considering the information it received. The panel has heard the views of a broad range of stakeholders, including producers, supply chain participants, exporting businesses, community groups, animal welfare organisations and trading partners. I look forward to receiving the panel's report by 25 October 2023 and considering its recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consideration of the panel's recommendations will also give me and the government guidance for a timeframe for the phase out of live sheep exports by sea, including any necessary legislative processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5335 on the development of nuclear fusion reactors. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has committed to reduce emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Nuclear fusion remains an experimental technology and will be developed and commercialised too slowly to help Australia meet these targets. The International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, reports that the building and operation of demonstration, electricity-producing fusion power plants could occur by 2050, depending on funding and technical advancement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GenCost 2022-23 Report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator, shows that renewables are the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and cheaper to operate than nuclear power facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative prohibition on the approval of nuclear power plants under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>does not differentiate between nuclear technologies. The government has no plans to change the longstanding moratorium on nuclear power in Australia, or the laws which prohibit its deployment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns of this petition to the government's attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 enclosing Petition EN5341, with 1785 signatures, concerning processing times for a Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) (subclass 191) visa in the Regional Provisional stream</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the important and valuable contribution that regional visa holders have made in closing labour and skills gaps and supporting businesses and communities through their commitment to living, working and studying in regional areas of Australia while on a pathway to permanent residence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Processing of applications for regional visas, such as the subclass 191 visa and applications relating to occupations in regional Australia have priority, as per Ministerial Direction 100, in order to support regional workforce needs. In this program year (beginning 1 July 2023) there have been more than 1,400 subclass 191 visas granted in the Regional Provisional stream. More information is available at: http://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-processing- times/skilled-visa-processing-priorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recently, the Government announced further funding in the 2023-24 Budget for visa processing officers, with an additional $48.1 million over 12 months to continue efforts to manage the number of visas on-hand. This follows the Government's announcement investment of $36 million in September 2022 at the Jobs and Skills Summit about the onboarding of an extra 500 positions to support visa processing. As a result, the Department of Home Affairs is making significant inroads in reducing on hand visa backlog and finalising applications. Actual processing time can vary due to individual circumstances including whether a complete application has been made and the time to perform required checks and receive more information about health, character, and national security requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be interested to know that in June 2023 the Department clarified that there is no minimum income requirement for eligible applicants for a subclass 191 visa. Applicants must, however, provide notices of assessment issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for three income years out of the five years of their eligible provisional visa. Further information is available at http://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/skilled-regional-191.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5343 on the Australian Government's decision to increase maximum dispensing quantities for some medications listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's decision to implement this measure was based on the recommendation of the independent expert Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and has patient benefit and reducing cost-of-living pressures at its core.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing medicines quantities provided on a single script will deliver significant savings for patients, which is why it is an accepted practice in many comparable countries around the world. Patients in countries that Australia most commonly compares itself to have similar arrangements in place, where patients can access up to 90 or 100 days of commonly used medicines on a single script.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to supporting better access to healthcare for all Australians, including through critical services provided by pharmacists. The Government is committed to a vibrant community pharmacy sector in Australia, with a growing role for pharmacy in primary healthcare. Investment in expanded pharmacy programs is key in ensuring patients have greater and easier access to critical health services through their local community pharmacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Every single dollar that will be saved by the Government from lower dispensing fees paid to pharmacies, will be reinvested straight back into community pharmacy, funding pharmacy services that directly benefit patients. This will be achieved through:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$654.9 million over four years for Community Pharmacy Programs. This includes increasing the total budget for Programs under the Seventh Community Pharmacy Agreement (7CPA) from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as well as securing funding for these programs to continue beyond the 7CPA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$377.3 million over four years for a nationally consistent, Commonwealth funded Opioid Dependent Treatment Program, which commenced 1 July 2023. This is in addition to dispensing related remuneration for these medicines under the Section 100 Highly Specialised Drugs Community Access Program. Pharmacies are expected to receive $175 to $191 per patient, per month under these new arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$114.1 million over four years to expand the vaccines administered by a pharmacist under the National Immunisation Program. From 1 January 2024, pharmacists will be paid $18.85 per vaccine administered—the same rate a GP receives for a Level A consultation to provide the same service. This is something multiple pharmacy stakeholders have asked successive Governments for. Which vaccines a pharmacist can administer varies between states/territories depending on local legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$79.5 million over four years to double the total annual budget for the Regional Pharmacy Maintenance Allowance, ensuring regional, rural and remote Australians have continued access to their local pharmacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$148.2 million over four years for the Regional Pharmacy Transition Allowance. This allowance will provide additional Government assistance to pharmacies in regional, rural, and remote Australia. The RPTA will temporarily support eligible pharmacies in Modified Monash (MM) Model MM2-7 with funding support phasing down across four years as pharmacy owners transition business arrangements to account for 60-day dispensing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures will ensure the ongoing strength of this part of the health sector and provide new opportunities for expanded pharmacist scope of practice. It benefits people accessing their medicines, it benefits pharmacists in managing their workload and delivering more advanced clinical services and it benefits GPs and other prescribers serving their community. These measures will ensure the pharmacists who work in community pharmacy will be able to get out from behind the counter and provide more tailored support to Australians. We will continue to support hard working pharmacists, while ensuring Australians can manage cost of living pressures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At a time of immense change in the Australian healthcare system, the Australian Government has already commenced negotiations around the Eighth Community Pharmacy Agreement {8CPA). Should consultation proceed well, it is the intention of the Australian Government to seek to finalise negotiations for an 8CPA and have it commence by 1 March 2024. The Government is committed to developing a new agreement in partnership, and through negotiation, with the pharmacy sector. Consultations for the 8CPA will include patient groups, medicines wholesalers and distributors, and others who have a stake in the growth and development of pharmacy services that benefit all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to supporting a thriving community pharmacy sector. The implementation of 60-day dispensing is occurring over three phases in 12 months to minimise the disruption to pharmacies and allow them to adjust. We will continue to support hard working pharmacists through the reinvestments and additional funding, whilst ensuring Australians can manage cost. of living pressures.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding a petition presented in the House of Representatives on the subject of the Myanmar military regime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, and the ongoing repression and violence of the military regime. Since the military staged a coup in February 2021, the people of Myanmar have demonstrated their courage and commitment to a democratic country, and have shown determined resilience in the face of unspeakable atrocities. We continue to stand with the people of Myanmar in the face of increasing repression and violence by the military regime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government uses all levers at our disposal, bilaterally, regionally, and multilaterally, to press for the cessation of violence, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, the release of all those unjustly detained, and full implementation of ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 February 2023, I announced additional autonomous sanctions on those directly responsible for the military coup and ongoing repression and violence in Myanmar. This includes targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 16 individuals responsible for the coup and the violence and oppression of the subsequent military regime, and targeted financial sanctions on two military-controlled entities. These announcements built upon existing targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against five members of the Myanmar military. Australia has maintained a long-standing arms embargo on Myanmar, and we support calls for a global arms embargo.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue to monitor the regime's actions, and we will keep our targeted sanctions towards Myanmar under review. Consistent with the approach we take on all sanctions regimes, it would not be appropriate to discuss whether specific persons or entities might be under consideration. Sanctions are just one foreign policy tool at our disposal, and we will continue to calibrate our response to the Myanmar crisis, taking into consideration a range of factors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue to support the people of Myanmar through the provision of development and humanitarian assistance, including $121 million in 2023-24. We prioritise the needs of the most poor and vulnerable, with an emphasis on women and girls, and vulnerable groups in hard to reach and conflict-affected areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to maintaining global attention on the crisis in Myanmar, and we will continue to work closely with regional and international partners to find options to de- escalate the crisis and support efforts towards a resolution.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5345 on the implementation of water-friendly policies, which was recently presented in the House.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition highlights the importance of securing Australia's water future—something I am very passionate about. Our nation faces considerable pressure on managing our water resources sustainably due to climate change and increasing demands from a growing population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has developed and implemented several water-friendly policies to assist with achieving water security for our nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is investing responsibly in water infrastructure projects that support water security in regional and remote communities through the National Water Grid Fund. This includes projects that improve water reliability and quality to meet Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, particularly in remote First Nations communities. Additionally, the fund invests in water efficiency and recycling projects to increase resilience to climate change by supplementing water supplies, particularly for agriculture, industrial use, and community green spaces. An example of this is the Government's investment in projects involving reuse of treated wastewater in industrial and agricultural production. Further information on the National Water Grid Fund and existing projects is at nationalwatergrid.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (WELS) scheme was established in 2005. It is a cooperative initiative between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and industry. The scheme reduces demand for potable water by informing consumers about the water efficiency of household products, including taps, showers, toilets, urinals, washing machines and dishwashers at the point of sale. WELS helps businesses and consumers to make decisions that can reduce their water use, saving them money on water and energy bills while improving national water security and reliability across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">WELS has been successful in contributing to estimated savings of:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Water Initiative, a shared commitment signed by all Australian governments in 2004, has also played a key role in guiding sustainable water policy and reform for nearly 20 years. Significant progress has been made in implementing actions under the agreement. It has promoted more efficient water use, particularly in urban settings, and encouraged the uptake of innovative water supplies such as recycled water. I am building on this by developing a new National Water Initiative to guide water reform and sustainable water use under climate change. We will explore ways to ensure we use our limited water resources wisely, including water efficiency and the use of all water supply methods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key part of securing Australia's water future is ensuring water security for the environment. This is why the Government is committed to implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. I introduced the Water Amendment Bill to Parliament on 6 September 2023 to support this. If passed, the amendments I proposed will give us more time and more options to deliver the 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. This is essential to protect our river ecosystems from environmental collapse, and to save our native animals from extinction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These are just some examples of the work the Government is doing on behalf of all Australians to achieve water security for our nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is looking ahead to determine what a water secure future looks like and how we can help Australia get there. As I have been listening to stakeholders, I have continued to affirm that all options are on the table. We welcome ideas for managing Australia's water resources sustainably.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5346 on support for the formation of a National Eczema Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges that eczema sufferers and health professionals are currently calling for the development of a national strategy for eczema to improve the care and management of Australians impacted by this condition. I am aware that Eczema Support Australia (ESA) is recommending that a national eczema strategy contain the following two main priority actions: eczema management education and support for patients and their families; and eczema education and management support for primary care health professionals and junior doctors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that the Australasian College of Dermatology and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners are also supporting the call for a national eczema strategy which is advocating for measures to address the national dermatology workforce shortage and lack of training for GPs, and the establishment of an eczema registry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand ESA has recently released a White Paper 'The Burden of Eczema—Evidence for a National Strategy' which provides an evaluation of the financial and humanistic burden of eczema in Australia in 2023. I note that this report also identifies current challenges in eczema care and makes a call to action for addressing the challenges of highest priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Strategic Framework for Chronic Conditions (Framework), endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2017, is the overarching policy for the prevention and management of chronic conditions in Australia. The Framework moves away from a disease-specific approach and better considers the shared health determinants, risk factors and multi-morbidities across a broad range of chronic conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2023-24 Budget, the Government provided authority for a refresh of the Framework to be undertaken to guide sustainable and evidence-based support for chronic conditions in the future. The refresh will ensure alignment of the Framework with other strategies and action plans developed since the Framework was published, such as the National Preventive Health Strategy, as well as new evidence and international policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please note that relevant staff from the Department of Health and Aged Care met with ESA on 24 July 2023 and advised ESA that, in the context of the Government moving away from a disease-specific approach to addressing chronic conditions, further condition-specific action plans are not a priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding eczema, the Government is currently providing $16.6 million to support the National Allergy Council Jointly established by Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Australia and the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy) to .fund activities associated with the prevention, treatment, and management of allergies. This includes the implementation of a shared care model for allergy care and provision of support for allergy sufferers, (especially for those in regional, rural, and remote areas) by upskilling health professionals through expanded training resources and new models of training delivery. The shared care model will look into establishing agreed minimum standards of care for several allergic diseases including eczema.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More broadly, in relation to addressing allergic disease and anaphylaxis in Australia, the Government as part of the 2022-23 Federal Budget, announced $10.2 million over four years to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute to expand the Centre for Food and Allergy Research to establish a National Centre of Excellence. This will centralise research on food, drug, vaccine, insect, and pollen allergies and provide accelerated access to the clinical trials of emerging allergy treatments for different types of allergies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to reducing the impact of chronic conditions on the Australian population and optimising quality-of-life for impacted individuals, their families and carers.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Road Safety is everybody's business and the Australian Government supports the introduction of new technologies that improve the safety of new vehicles. The Government's policy is to harmonise the national vehicle standards with international regulations wherever possible, primarily United Nations vehicle regulations.

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Response</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 October 2023 regarding petition EN5416 on behalf of 66 signatories regarding the latest COVID-19 subvariant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 October 2023, Australia's Chief Medical Officer declared that COVID-19 is no longer a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance. This declaration was supported by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This declaration is in line with the announcement by the World Health Organization Director-General that the International Health Regulations 2005 Emergency Committee for COVID-19 determined that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Epidemiological data also supports this position. COVID-19 remains a serious infectious disease but no longer constitutes a public health emergency. Future waves of transmission continue to be expected across the next few years, whether due to waning immunity or new variants, but at this stage current and emerging variants are no more dangerous than other Omicron strains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Continued uptake of protective behaviours such as vaccination and other mitigation strategies are now more appropriate than an emergency response. The primary aim of COVID-19 vaccination continues to be to reduce the risk of serious illness and death. Current vaccines are very effective in preventing serious disease (including death) in most people, but COVID-19 still poses a significant health threat to older Australians and people with multiple co-morbidities. The latest advice on COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters can be found on the Australian Technical Advisory Group on lmmunisation's website at www.health.gov.au/atagi.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With the wide availability and uptake of vaccination and oral treatments for COVID-19, the risks for the Australian population have reduced and public health measures taken by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments have changed accordingly. Australia has shifted to managing COVID-19 consistent with other common communicable diseases, focusing on prevention, reducing transmission and management of serious illness, hospitalisations and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For further information about the end of the COVID-19 emergency response, see www.health.gov.au/news/ahppc-statement-end-of-covid-19-emergency-response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government continues to balance public health and social measures against the health risks of COVID-19 to ensure our response remains proportionate, whilst protecting those most at risk.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 October 2023 on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions concerning petition EN5433 on bullying.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the community concern around bullying in schools and its impact on students and their families, and mental health and wellbeing. The Australian Government takes the safety and protection of children and young people seriously. All students have the right to be safe at school and bullying of any nature is unacceptable. All schools have a responsibility to ensure that their students are safe, respected and supported each day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government plays a national leadership role in setting and advocating for national priorities in school education, state and territory governments and non- government education authorities are responsible for the operations of schools. The Government values the work that state and territory government and non-government education authorities do to manage bullying in schools and ensure that appropriate measures are in place so that all students in schools can learn in safe and supportive environments. This includes the development of policies for addressing bullying.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has made a range of information and resources available to support school communities to prevent and address bullying, and promote wellbeing and resilience, which are outlined below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Student Wellbeing Hub (the Hub) provides a range of freely available information and resources for educators, students and parents to assist them to create and maintain a safe and supportive school environment. The Hub includes free resources and professional learning opportunities for teachers, a dedicated area for parents and a collection of age- appropriate activities and resources for students from Foundation to Year 12. This includes resources to help prevent and address bullying, and to support and strengthen the integral relationship between students' social and emotional development and their learning outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges that cyberbullying is a modern and evolving pressure on students, teachers and parents. To support the community to respond to this issue, the Government appointed an eSafety Commissioner. The eSafety Commissioner's website at www.esafety.qov.au provides information about cyberbullying and fact sheets on how people can assist themselves and others who may be cyberbullied. The eSafety Commissioner also investigates complaints about cyberbullying and can assist in having content removed from social media sites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has provided funding for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bullying. No Way! </span>website, available at www.bullyingnoway.gov.au, and associated resources for parents and teachers, and activities to support the annual National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence. The National Day of Action provides an opportunity for students and school communities to pledge their commitment to addressing bullying and violence. It is a positive day of action, empowering students and uniting school communities to find workable solutions to address bullying and violence. More than 6,400 schools registered to participate in the 2023 National Day of Action.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 16 October 2023, presenting a petition requesting the introduction of a government-regulated organisation to maintain minimum rental standards across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the petition's request, state and territory governments, under the Constitution, are responsible for the regulation of residential tenancies, including rental conditions and agreements. Each state and territory has its own tenants' advisory services, providing free and confidential advice about housing rights and possible supports. A list of tenants' unions is available at www.tenants.org.au/nato.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At National Cabinet in August this year the Commonwealth, state and territory governments committed to <span style="font-style:italic;">A Better Deal for Ren</span>ters to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. This included developing a nationally consistent framework including a requirement for genuine reasonable grounds for eviction, moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will make a tangible impact for the almost one-third of Australian households who rent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has committed to an ambitious housing reform agenda which will boost the supply of all housing—more public and social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These housing challenges didn't happen overnight and cannot be solved by one government alone. As mentioned, the Albanese Government is working with the states and territories and local governments to deliver better housing outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) has now started and will support 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes over its first five years. The Albanese Government has delivered on its commitment to establish the HAFF and it is the single biggest investment to support social and affordable rental housing in more than a decade.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We've delivered the largest increase to Commonwealth Rent Assistance in more than 30 years, with a 15 per cent increase in the maximum rate.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Federal funding of $1.7 billion has been provided for a one-year extension of the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement with States and Territories, including a $67.5 million boost to homelessness funding over the next year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Work to deliver on a new National Housing and Homelessness Plan is underway to identify the short, medium and long-term steps that can be taken to address housing issues in Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">More than 73,000 people have been helped into home ownership since the election of the Albanese Government through the Home Guarantee Scheme, including more than 9,000 through the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. The scheme has now been expanded significantly—changes will see friends, siblings, and other family members eligible for joint applications under the First Home Guarantee and the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We've also established an interim National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to provide expert advice and an evidence base on how Government can improve housing supply and affordability, and legislation has passed the Parliament to create the Council as a permanent independent body.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 November 2022 regarding Petition Number 0544. Your correspondence was provided by the Standing Committee on Petitions Secretariat (the Secretariat) on 17 August 2023, following an earlier transmission issue. The Secretariat confirmed Standing Order 209(b) requirements to respond to a referred petition within 90 days has lapsed and there is no formal timeframe to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition seeks to add a new category of education staff that specially accommodates disabled children in school, and for consideration of making it a requirement to have intervention/support staff in every school in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to equitable, inclusive schooling for all students, including students with disability. All schools in Australia are required under the Disability Standards for Education 2005 to provide reasonable adjustments for students with disability so they can access and participate in education on the same basis as their peers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Students with disability who require reasonable adjustments to fully participate in schooling are counted under the Nationally Consistent Collection of Data on School Students with Disability (NCCD). Teachers and other classroom professionals use their professional judgement to indicate the level of additional support a student is provided in the classroom. A formal diagnosis of disability is not required, and disability can be imputed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support the implementation of reasonable adjustments, the Government provides funding through the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) student with disability loading. The loading calculation uses information reported in the NCCD. The Government is providing an estimated $27.4 billion in recurrent funding for schools in 2023 under the SRS funding arrangements, of which an estimated $3.1 billion is being provided under the student with disability loading. Schools and school systems have the flexibility to direct this funding to support their students.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All teachers must meet the requirements of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers by designing and implementing teaching activities that support the participation and learning of students with disability. Teachers must also address relevant policy and legislative requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also improving initial teacher education (ITE) to better prepare beginning teachers for the classroom and improve student outcomes. In July 2023, Education Ministers provided in-principle support to all 14 recommendations made by the Teacher Education Expert Panel (the Panel), and some initial actions were agreed. The first of these is adding core content to ITE course accreditation standards by the end of 2023 and ensuring core content is embedded in all ITE programs before the end of 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the areas of core content identified by the Panel is responsive teaching and content that ensures teachers teach in ways that are culturally and contextually appropriate and responsive to the needs of diverse learners, including students with a disability. Submissions made to the Panel's discussion paper indicated broad support from stakeholders for the core content, including making explicit reference to supporting students with disability. Further information is available in the final report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Several new resources have been released to support education providers in understanding and implementing their obligations towards students with disability. Co-designed resources have also been released to help students with disability and their families understand and exercise their rights. Further information about these resources is available on the Department of Education's website at www.education.gov.au/disability-standards-education-2005.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian schools utilise a variety of strategies to meet the needs of individual students with disability and to support adjustments, including different delivery approaches and engaging with support staff and allied health professionals where needed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government plays a leadership role in education and provides substantial funding for schools, state and territory governments are responsible for the regulation, administration, and operation of schools. Accordingly, the petitioners may wish to raise their views with their state or territory Education Department. Contact information is enclosed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 August 2023 regarding a petition on overhead powerlines (PN0564). I appreciate your work as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions and the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's electricity grid needs to be strengthened and reconfigured to meet the demands of the rapidly changing electricity market it serves. One of our key programs that is strengthening the grid is the Rewiring the Nation program which provides low-cost finance for the urgent upgrade and expansion of Australia's electricity grid at lowest cost—to unlock new renewables, increase the security of the grid and drive down power prices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Rewiring the Nation program is guided by the Australian Energy Market Operator's (AEMO) Integrated System Plan (ISP) as the roadmap for Australia's future grid. The ISP's optimal development path identifies the necessary new transmission to connect new generation and storage, and efficiently deliver firmed renewable energy to consumers through the national electricity market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Overhead transmission lines are reliable, efficient, and cost-effective means of transporting electricity across the country and are the best placed transmission infrastructure to empower Australia to meet its renewable energy goals. An overhead system is the most appropriate solution to allow the addition of future renewable energy generation plants to the grid. Undergrounding transmission lines is significantly more expensive and would place an unnecessary financial burden on energy users. Undergrounding also presents a number of technical issues. For example, undergrounding High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is technically feasible when directly connecting an energy generator to distribution, however many transmission projects in Australia require the ability to tap in and tap out additional generators along the project route.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's new overhead transmission lines will be world-class, having undergone rigorous design and testing. All lines will meet the Australian and New Zealand electrical standards, which have been designed to minimise risk of fault and fire and ensure the safety of nearby communities. Transgrid presented evidence to the NSW Parliamentary inquiry into the feasibility of undergrounding the transmission infrastructure for renewable energy projects (the inquiry) that the current reliability expectation of the overhead AC network in New South Wales is 99.998 per cent. This is one example of the strict requirements imposed on network providers to ensure the stability and reliability of our electricity networks to minimise outages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With the proper management and maintenance, transmission lines pose a very low risk of starting a fire. Electricity companies work directly with the Rural Fire Service in the ongoing management of lines and the prevention of bushfires. Their collaboration provides protection to communities and our natural environment in the unlikely event of a disaster. Bushfire risk was considered by the recent inquiry. Based on evidence provided by Transgrid and the Rural Fire Service, the inquiry found that overhead transmission lines do not pose a risk of igniting bushfires, and that the right procedures are in place to manage risk if bushfires are present.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Acknowledging the important role landholders and communities play in hosting critical transmission infrastructure, I encourage anyone directly affected to contact their relevant state or territory agency responsible for electricity transmission to find out more about compensation payments. For example:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The New South Wales Government has announced under the Strategic Benefit Payments Scheme, payments for a typical area of new transmission easement at a standard rate of $10,000 per km per year of transmission hosted for 20 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Victorian Government has announced payments for a typical area of new transmission easement at a standard rate of $8,000 per km per year of transmission hosted for 25 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34.05pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Queensland Government, through its transmission company Powerlink, has announced the new SuperGrid Landholder Payment Framework, which will increase payments for landholders hosting new transmission infrastructure. The increase in payments is based on property-specific values and impacts as opposed to a flat rate. Powerlink will also be the first transmission company in Australia to offer payments to landholders with properties adjacent to new transmission infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring the benefits of transmission projects are shared with the communities that host them. At the same time, it is important to note that compensation arrangements for landholders hosting or adjacent to transmissions lines is a state and territory responsibility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our government is committed to ensuring meaningful community engagement throughout the process of designing, planning, and implementing these vital transmission projects. The Australian Government has established a Community Engagement Review (the review) to bolster reforms in community engagement around renewable energy infrastructure upgrades and new developments. The review is being led by the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Andrew Dyer, and is considering among other things: impacts on agricultural land including emergency management; tourism impacts and other aesthetic and cultural considerations; and community engagement and benefit sharing (including financial, local infrastructure, knowledge sharing, and any other types of benefit). The final review report will be delivered to me by the end of 2023.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  On behalf of the Chair of the Petitions Committee, I'd like to inform the House of a change to the committee's approach to referring petitions to ministers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All in-order petitions are published on the parliament's website and presented in the House of Representatives. Under the standing orders, the Petitions Committee may also refer a petition to the minister responsible for the administration of the matters raised in the petition. The minister is then expected to provide a written response within 90 days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until now, the practice has been that almost all petitions are referred to a minister for a response. However, in recent months the committee has sought feedback on whether this approach continues to meet the needs and expectations of those who engage with the petitions system. This is in light of the significant increase in the number of petitions received by the House since the introduction of electronic petitioning in 2016. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair has previously reported, the committee posted an electronic survey on the parliament's website, seeking feedback on whether a petition should have a minimum number of signatures before being referred to a minister for a response. The committee also wrote to all members, seeking their views. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback received by the committee indicated strong support for the idea that a petition should have reached a certain number of signatures before a minister should be expected to provide a written response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore decided to introduce a modest signature threshold for the referral of a petition to a minister for a response. Starting in the new year, the committee will refer a petition to a minister only if the petition receives 50 or more signatures. This will apply to both paper and electronic petitions. The committee will monitor the impact of this change throughout the next year to ensure that it is an appropriate baseline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ministerial referral process is a valuable part of the House petitions system. It allows for petitioners' concerns to be placed directly before the minister and provides petitioners with important information in relation to their petition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this change, the committee is seeking to ensure that the referral process is sustainable, so that petitions with strong community support continue to receive considered and helpful ministerial responses within a reasonable time frame. I thank the House. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America from 28 October to 5 November 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a privilege to lead a parliamentary delegation to the United States at the end of October, which provided an opportunity to maintain and strengthen links between the parliamentarians of both countries, distinct from the links between our governments, and an opportunity for us to engage with American businesspeople, thought leaders, public servants, academics, scientists and journalists on matters that are crucial to Australia's future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In California, we were able to see firsthand world-leading clean-energy transformation opportunities in areas like concentrated solar generation and storage, courtesy of Heliogen, and understand the foundation of the zero-emission vehicle revolution that's occurring, with a visit to Tritium, the fast-charging phenomenon that was born in Brisbane. In California, over the course of the last financial quarter, one in four new vehicles purchased were zero-emission vehicles. In Australia, that rate has quadrupled under this government but is still only eight per cent, or one in 12. California, with a population of 40 million, has reached its target of installing 10,000 fast-charging stations a year ahead of schedule. In Australia, we have only 500 but expect the new National Electric Vehicle Charging Network to get us heading in California's direction. Similarly, the Port of Los Angeles, under its Clean Air Action Plan, has a clean truck fund rate that applies to containers being loaded onto polluting vehicles, with 100 per cent of the accrued funds going to support operators that switch to zero-emission vehicles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In San Diego, we were very grateful to have some time with Vice Admiral Michael Boyle, who's responsible for the US Navy's 3rd Fleet, and to go aboard the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>, commissioned earlier this year in Sydney but built by Australian shipbuilder Austal, which is headquartered in my electorate. We also met with Professor Leinen and her scientist colleagues from the remarkable Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Their work on marine protection and climate science is globally significant, and it was helpful to be reminded that marine sanctuaries are essential to protecting marine biodiversity and improving the productivity of well-managed fisheries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Washington, it was an honour to meet the conveners of the Friends of Australia Congressional Caucus, representatives Joe Courtney and Mike Gallagher, and to discuss our countries' shared work and interests in building inclusive regional prosperity, security and peace. We were also very generously hosted for meetings with Senators Pete Ricketts and Todd Young, and it was a particular highlight to be taken into the Senate gallery with Alaskan Senator Lisa Murkowski. From all these meetings, and with the benefit of an excellent briefing from Lachlan Carey of the Rocky Mountain Institute, we gained valuable insight into the concerted effect of a range of measures designed to reduce emissions, boost renewable energy, revitalise manufacturing, decrease energy insecurity and improve self-sufficiency and resilience. The US is now doing this work on an unprecedented scale through the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While in Washington, we also had very helpful and relevant briefings from the Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources at the US Department of State and from the National Park Service. The latter was particularly helpful in terms of wildfire response and mitigation, noting the potential for greater cooperation between our countries on that critical work. We had a fascinating chat with Dr Charles Edel and Kathryn Paik from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, at which Dr Edel is the Australia chair and has already brought a more penetrating focus on Australia and the Pacific into the competitive and understandably hectic Washington foreign affairs and think tank world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the focused, engaged, collegiate participation of the parliamentary delegation—the members for Durack, Parkes, Warringah and Paterson—and the thoughtful and attentive work of delegation secretary James Strickland. Parliamentary delegations sensibly seek to encompass some of the diversity of views and experience in this place, which in turn reflect the diversity across Australia. At the same time, delegations present a consistency when it comes to our serious-minded approach to representing Australia abroad through open and honest engagement based on friendship, respect, the pursuit of mutual interests, the tackling of common challenges and the recognition of distinctive national perspectives and sovereignty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were given customarily excellent support from DFAT folk on both sides of the US. Abigail Pennington was the bridge between the two sides, and we were very grateful for her above-and-beyond professionalism and good company. I also acknowledge with gratitude the excellent planning and preparatory work of Shannon Karppinen in the International and Parliamentary Relations office. Parliamentary delegations are an important means by which Australian representatives gain a deeper understanding of our regional circumstances and forge better connections with those who play an equivalent role in seeking to advance their countries' shared wellbeing. </span>

                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I'd like to acknowledge the member for Fremantle for his leadership of this delegation and thank him for the comprehensive report that we've just heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very honoured to be part of this delegation. I'd like to acknowledge the other members that were on it. Apart from the benefit of the relationships with other countries, these delegations are really important in getting to know some of your fellow members, getting an understanding of them personally and also the electorates that they represent. On the tour bus we had some lively discussions around various issues in a very friendly, collegiate way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Mr James Strickland for the work that he did in providing support on this delegation, and also the department. I thought it was well balanced between the California half of this delegation, where we looked at renewables—we went to the Port of Los Angeles—and also the connection with the US Navy and the importance of that relationship between Australia and the US in the military context. Meeting the admiral in charge of the US 3rd Fleet was incredibly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has got an interest in logistics, the Port of Los Angeles was fascinating to me. The member for Fremantle mentioned the port's desire to go to zero emissions. What was interesting was that there's still some development of technology needed to make that happen and that the electric trucks, under their current design, can't carry a legally loaded container on the roads of California. That's driving a greater push towards hydrogen driven vehicles that will have that ability to actually work efficiently within the guidelines of the local law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Washington, the conversations that we had on Capitol Hill were very important because at the moment there's quite a discussion around the AUKUS deal. The conversations we had with the friends of Australia in the senate and in congress were very important because the legislation to support the first part of that deal is going through congress and the senate—maybe before Christmas, maybe in the New Year. It is important that we have supporters in there that are prepared to drive this issue because, clearly, that is a very important deal, and having those personal relationships, meeting those people and having frank discussions is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Inflation Reduction Act, which doesn't really describe the purpose of that act that the America has just instigated, has enormous potential for Australia with the benefits of diversifying the world market. I was really interested in this, particularly seeing Australia as a supplier of critical minerals. One of the representatives from my electorate had been in discussions with the Prime Minister when he was there the week before, talking with US counterparts about a supply line for critical minerals and raw materials from Australia. It will have enormous benefits for my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the other members of the delegation for their friendship and camaraderie: the leader, the member for Fremantle; the member for Durack; the member for Paterson; and the member for Warringah. In justifying sending five members of parliament to the United States for a week or so, I feel very comfortable that it was an investment well spent. I think that the relationship between our two countries is important, I think the relationships between the members in this place are important and I think it was a very beneficial delegation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I second the motion. Modern Australia was built on the back on immigration. For decades, we welcomed hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world, provided them with support, gave them jobs, got their children educated and looked after their health and their broader welfare. For example, Australia has the highest concentration per capita of Holocaust survivors in the world outside Israel—most pertinent to remember at this terrible time in global history. We're a better nation for it. So, what changed? Why is it that one person has been held in detention for nearly 16 years when, a decade ago, the immigration authorities stated that their aim was to process applications for onshore protection visas within 90 days? Why is it taking close to 2½ years for the Department of Home Affairs to make its initial assessment when it's less than two months in the US and just a fortnight in Canada?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say it all goes back to that day in August 2001 when <span style="font-style:italic;">MV Tampa</span> heaved into view off Christmas Island. At that moment, the last shreds of bipartisanship in refugee policy were tossed overboard. From then on, it's been one wedge after another. It has to stop. This bill, the Migration Amendment (Limits on Immigration Detention) Bill 2023, presented by the member for North Sydney, is a start. I, for one, am here for it. I will not be wedged, and nor will the community that I represent. In voting for me, they were voting for more humane treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Labor policy that there be a 90-day limit on immigration detention. Yet here we are, halfway through this term of parliament, and progress has been limited, to say the least. Whether or not a 90-day limit comes into effect, there may be a way through this: an independent panel for detention review, similar to state and territory parole boards, that could make recommendations to the minister for immigration applying to all people in immigration detention. An independent panel would be an effective interim non-legislative solution which could be introduced immediately, would be consistent with Labor policy and would ensure that immigration detention complies with Australia's international obligations, that there are alternatives to detention and that detention is only applied as a measure of last resort. There is precedent for this: the Independent Reviewer of Adverse Security Assessments, set up in 2012.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would require the Minister for Communications to implement a trial of age assurance technology precisely as recommended by the eSafety Commissioner, and report to the parliament on its progress every six months.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this would do is actually require pornography sites to ensure that people who are under 18 do not access their content, and there's a long background to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a bipartisan parliamentary inquiry, chaired by the member for Fisher back in 2020, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Protecting the age of innocence</span> that called for this to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021 the coalition asked the eSafety Commissioner to conduct a review into this very serious issue of protecting kids online, and after a two-year process the eSafety Commissioner came back to the government in March and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot before seeking to prescribe and mandate age assurance technologies for access to online pornography.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a very, very clear recommendation all about protecting kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government waited five months after receiving that recommendation and then—what did the Minister for Communications do at the end of the five months?—said, 'No. We're not going to do it. We're going to reject the recommendation from our own expert who has spent two years looking into this absolutely crucial and fundamental issue.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why on earth would the government not take action to protect kids as recommended by the eSafety Commissioner? What the government said instead is, 'Let's leave it up to industry. Let's leave it up to industry codes'—literally, industry codes to which the pornography industry itself will contribute. Now, this process is going to take years, whereas the eSafety Commissioner says, 'Get on with a trial of this technology now.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the government says the technology isn't ready. Well, tell the UK that, because just four weeks ago the United Kingdom legislated for age verification technology. It is now law in the UK for age verification technology to be in place for children to be stopped from accessing specifically pornography, specifically material related to self-harm, suicide and eating disorders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's in the statute books of the United Kingdom today. Our government in Australia, the Albanese government, says the technology's not ready; let's leave it up to the industry themselves to write some codes that'll take years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's own national plan to address violence against women and children says this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With pornography now overwhelmingly consumed online and via mobile devices, it is both prevalent and pervasive, perpetuating sexist, misogynistic and degrading views about women. This is a serious concern in addressing the drivers of violence against women and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is in the government's own report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of Australia's most eminent experts have very strongly criticised the government's decision. Here is what the experts said in a letter organised by Collective Shout:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is our strong view that the Government has allowed itself to be swayed by industry resistance to an age verification system. Vested interests should not have been put before the wellbeing of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a strong statement. Who said it? Well, 49 people signed that letter, including: Robert Fitzgerald, the former commissioner of the royal commission into child sexual abuse; author Maggie Dent; Alison Geale, the CEO of Bravehearts; the Daniel Morcombe Foundation; Chanel Contos from Teach Us Consent; Grace Tame of the Grace Tame Foundation; author Madonna King; author Steve Biddulph; and Anna Bowden, the CEO of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children Australia. They all signed that letter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did Anne Hollonds say? Anne Hollonds is the National Children's Commissioner specifically charged with looking after the interests of Australian children. What did Ms Hollonds say in relation to the government's decision not to implement this very clear recommendation of the eSafety Commissioner? That is what Anne Hollonds said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If child wellbeing was a national priority, we would act on e-Safety's plan to trial ways to protect young kids from online porn. This would help to reduce child sex abuse, youth crime, domestic and family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the National Children's Commissioner said. So there's been condemnation by dozens and dozens of experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know who did welcome this decision by the Minister for Communications and the Albanese government? Not child safety experts and certainly not Bravehearts, the Daniel Morecombe Foundation or the former commissioner of the royal commission into child sexual abuse. They didn't welcome it at all but the exact opposite. Do you know who welcomed it? The Eros Foundation, which speaks on behalf of the pornography industry, which we know is responsible for so much damaging and degrading material that is being consumed by Australian children every day. The Eros Foundation welcomed Minister Rowland's decision, but dozens of our top child safety experts condemned it. Something is very, very wrong here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the Prime Minister in this? Does the Prime Minister know the decision that his minister has made? You would hope so; he is the Prime Minister. So, if he knows about it, that means he must support it. How can the Prime Minister support such an appalling decision which has been so roundly condemned by experts? The basic question is: what on earth is going on here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament should support this bill because this bill forces the minister to take action. The minister, for whatever reason, hasn't wanted to take action. This bill says, 'You have to.' It says: 'Like it or not, you've got to get on with it. You've got to do what the eSafety Commissioner wants you to do and what all of these very eminent experts want you to do and conduct this very important technology trial.' That's why this bill should be supported. It's incredibly important. This is one of the defining issues of our era—the way we respond to issues of child safety online. I strongly commend this bill to the House. I have a little time left which I want to cede to the member for Fisher, who was the chair of the original inquiry that started this process in 2020.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  Yes. I support this private member's bill, the Online Safety Amendment (Protecting Australian Children from Online Harm) Bill 2023, which has been raised. I'll just comment on your leadership as a member of that committee, Mr Deputy Speaker Freelander, and the leadership of the member for Newcastle, who was my deputy chair during that inquiry. Our committee spoke as one. Age verification needs to be introduced in Australia. There is absolutely no justification in Australia to allow big porn to be impacting upon the lives of young people in Australia today. I know you support it, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know the member for Newcastle supports it. In fact, every member on that committee supported the introduction of age verification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just have a think about some of the evidence that we heard. Let me remind you, Deputy Speaker Freelander, and anybody listening that access to pornography from a very young age is impacting upon the poor mental health of our young people. It's furthering sexism and objectification of women in our community. It's causing sexual aggression and violence. There is a direct correlation between domestic violence and the regular use of pornography—and we're not just talking about the old pornography of days gone by, of <span style="font-style:italic;">Penthouse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Playboy</span>; this is hardcore, violent, demeaning pornography of women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is inexplicable why this government is turning its back on young Australians. The Labor Party needs to take a very good, long, hard look at itself and change the position of the communications minister. Lives are at stake—the lives and wellbeing, particularly, of our young people, not just boys but boys and girls who are growing up with a very strange and twisted concept of what is normal sexuality. I compliment the member for Banks on this bill.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak to this motion moved in my name. When I drafted this motion less than two weeks ago the number of Australian women who had been killed by acts of violence this year was 47. Today, that number stands at 53. Six more women have been killed in the last two weeks alone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a national crisis when it comes to violence against women in Australia. Each year I rise in this House to read the names of women who have been violently killed. Last week I read the names of 47 women. Today I rise to read six more—and, sadly, a number of these are unnamed women because their names have not been publicly released as yet. They are an unnamed woman, age 37; an unnamed woman, age 44; an unnamed woman, age 45; Julianne Egan, age 63; yet another unnamed woman, age 39; and Jodie Jewell, aged just 55. I want to acknowledge the work of Destroy The Joint, who do the job of maintaining the Counting Dead Women register in Australia, and thank them for the heartbreaking work they do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When more than one woman a week is violently killed, usually by an intimate partner or someone close to them, it is beyond time for a national reckoning. This national crisis requires a fundamental shift in our culture, our behaviours and our attitudes towards women. The Albanese Labor government has set itself a goal of ending violence against women and children within a generation. Australia has never set itself an ambition like this before, and it's not going to be easy. We must try because the status quo is not good enough.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed 2.7 million women have experienced partner violence or abuse. The 2021-22 Personal Safety Survey also found that women living in households under financial stress were more than twice as likely to face violence or abuse and that more than 300,000 women were pregnant when they experienced violence by their partner. First Nations women experience disproportionately high rates of violence. Women with disability in Australia are twice as likely to have experienced sexual violence over their lifetime than women without disability. And lesbian, bisexual and queer women experience higher rates of sexual violence than heterosexual women in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, we announced a new statistical dashboard that will provide more timely reporting on intimate partner violence. We know that to end violence we must be able to measure it. Understanding the scale of the issue with accurate, verified, closer-to-real-time data is critical. The new dashboard, with quarterly updates initially, will enable police, governments, policymakers and those who are working to end violence against women and children to better understand what is happening and when.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes on top of our funding for consent and respectful relationships education; sexual violence prevention pilots; support of the work of Our Watch, the national leading organisation for primary prevention of family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia; and the development of a national perpetrator risk assessment framework to identify risks posed by perpetrators and support earlier intervention.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is taking immediate and practical steps to prevent family and domestic violence and better support victim-survivors with a $2.3 billion investment in this area. We’ve released a 10-year national plan to end violence against women and children, including a dedicated plan for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We’ve added 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave to the National Employment Standards, reduced time for victims-survivors to access the Escaping Violence Payment, secured funding for the delivery of frontline services and have committed to growing this workforce. We’ve increased financial support for temporary visa holders experiencing violence, and we’re making the family law system simpler and safer for people fleeing family violence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  A few weeks ago I was working on a joint statement with my co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Ending Violence Against Women and Children, the member for Canberra and Senator Waters in the other place. The statement called on all levels of government to prioritise the issue of gendered violence while also calling for us as a society to drive cultural change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statement was driven by a surge of women being killed by men's violence—five women in just 10 days prior to the statement. At the time the total was 43 women, as reported by Counting Dead Women Australia. Today, as the member for Newcastle has said, that number is at 53, and we know that coming into the holiday season there will be an increase in family violence incidents and that number will undoubtedly rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Newcastle stated earlier, one-in-three women have experienced physical violence perpetrated by a man since the age of 15, and we know that violence doesn’t discriminate—it affects women of every age from every cultural background, with different jobs and levels of education or income, living in different areas and leading different lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a national emergency. The rate of femicides over recent years is horrific, and we must continue to raise our voices. I back the initiative from the member for Newcastle to read the names of the women who have been killed this year, as she has just done this morning, and I understand the member for Goldstein will also be calling on the government to establish an Australian homicide index that will generate the evidence needed to inform responses to family violence, an initiative I also support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here today to mark the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which begins the 16 days of activism against gender based violence, I want to reiterate that we must move beyond the long-held school of thought that this is a women's issue. The continued violence against women at the hands of men is a men's issue. It is a societal and cultural issue, and women cannot keep fighting this alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend my colleagues from all sides who continue to work so hard to raise awareness and fight for funding for vital services and programs and who continue to speak up. I know so many men in here also care deeply about ending violence against women, and I acknowledge my colleagues the member for Sturt and the member for Cowper who will be speaking on this motion today. But I’m calling for men in here today to be a little louder. Your voices matter. You are leaders of your community and have a vital role to play in having the hard conversations in your electorates. I'd like to thank the member for Bruce and Senator Birmingham, who have taken the time recently to attend briefings and events in here about this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned earlier, a critical role we as elected representatives can play is to ensure funding is delivered for critical frontline services and increasingly for programs that address the systemic cultural issues which feed the continuation of gender based violence. In the northern Tasmanian region, organisations Women's Legal Service Tasmania, Yemaya, Laurel House and Engender Equality are working collaboratively to roll out pioneering programs such as mentors in violence training; partnering with Girl Guides to deliver respectful relationships workshops, including early consent training for girls; and even a partnership with Playgroup Tasmania and Happy Habits to roll out the All Come Out to Play! program, which delivers messages of gender equality and respectful relationships through song, dance and story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the evidence bears out that we must start educating at a very young age in order to make a breakthrough on the long-held societal norms, and I'm thrilled to see this program rolling out in Tasmania. To each of these organisations, particularly in my electorate, I thank you for your tireless work. I know you are all working towards the ultimate goal of making your own jobs obsolete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, while the demand for services and education is higher than ever, I implore the government, as I did request of the coalition when in government, to put an end to the short-term funding demands placed on these organisations that require funding certainty to recruit and retain qualified staff and to roll out and deliver evidence based programs across the long term. I suggest that, in a region like northern Tasmania, given the collaboration between a number of services, it would be great to fund the organisations as a hub model, which would ensure that the needs of women impacted by violence could be consistently met through a range of services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enough is enough is enough. I've lost count of the number of times I've spoken parliament on the topic of violence against women and children, and I live in hope that, if I am still standing here next year to mark this day, at least in this country we may have begun to see the slightest shift on the dial.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298800" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MASCARENHAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  We know that, from the age of 15, a staggering one in three women and girls in Australia have experienced violence. We also know that too many women are killed by intimate partners. The member for Newcastle explained earlier that, just two weeks ago when she drafted this motion, there had been 47 women killed this year from this form of violence. Today it stands at 53. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this motion put by the member for Newcastle and I know that it's s the tireless and passionate advocates for victims of gender based violence that continue to advocate for the issue. We share an ambition to eliminate gender based violence in Australia in one generation. I acknowledge the enormity of this challenge, but I also make a personal commitment to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has motivated me to speak on this today is the relationship that I have developed with different people within my electorate, including a wonderful woman called Shenane. When we talk about courage and survival, I think of Shenane, and she has given me permission to talk about her story. Before I share her story, I will say that this has a trigger warning and, if people might be confronted by this, I suggest that you may want to leave. Shenane is a local community leader whom I met in Belmont last year. She's outgoing, confident, positive and incredibly professional as well. It was a short time ago, though, that Shenane was unrecognisable. She was the victim of horrific domestic violence that left her in a hospital bed, fighting for her life. When you hear her story, you'll understand how truly lucky she is to be alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over a period of five years, she suffered repeated abuse that put her in hospital many times, bleeding, bruised, broken, concussed. However, it was the final attack that was the most sustained and vicious. I will say that it was so horrific that I struggled to listen to it. It's not something that any woman, child or person should have to endure. She was placed in an induced coma for nine months to let her brain heal. It took her 18 months to learn how to walk and talk again. She now lives with a permanent traumatic brain injury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, when I met her, she was a fun, energetic, positive person. How could something like this happen to her? How could something like this happen to any woman? She says that there were signs of the controlling relationship in the first 18 months of her relationship, and it started quite insidiously. It started with money going missing, the controlling of money and the use of her money for his purposes, which made her employment unsustainable, undermined her independence and undermined her finances. By the time she realised, it was almost too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About two years into the relationship is when the physical abuse started. When it did, we failed her. The community failed her. The system failed her. On one occasion, after she had received stitches to the skull, the emergency doctor's only take-home advice was to see the doctor in a few weeks to get her stitches removed. She didn't make it; her stitches were torn apart by another blow to the head before she had the chance. She wants to make sure that health workers are better informed about how to help victims, and this is why I want to get behind the efforts to raise awareness of the early signs of abuse and control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2022 election, my team knocked on 45,000 doors, and we spoke to countless people. One of the conversations that stuck in my mind was with an older man. His daughter and grandchild were living with him. He explained that her partner was controlling her money, and the control was so insidious that the partner would not actually allow her to buy sanitary products. It was a calculated denial of money to inflict harm and shame on a woman to control her. This type of abuse has a name. It's called economic abuse. Often, as Shenane's story exposed, it can be an early sign of impending violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shenane speaks about herself as one of the lucky ones—a survivor. She has embraced life with renewed purpose. She now has a job advocating for those with traumatic brain injury. She is an amazing Torres Strait Islander woman, and it is my privilege to know her as my friend and know her story. But what I want to make sure of is that all women have the opportunity to have and lead their best lives and to be free from violent relationships.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I thank the member for Newcastle for moving a motion on such an important issue. Last Saturday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and this year it marked the launch of the UNITE campaign, 16 days of action across the world, calling on governments to invest in preventing violence against women and girls. I'm wearing orange today, as a number of my crossbench colleagues are, in support of this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Intimate partner violence is the greatest health risk factor for women aged 25 to 44, and that's in this country. An estimated one in six women aged 18 years or over has experienced violence by a partner in this country. But it's not in faraway places, as we often think. Right in my community of Wentworth, when I spoke to the local police commander, they told me that up to 50 per cent of their time in their local police stations was taken up with domestic violence issues. It is everywhere, in places you do not expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month, 21-year-old Lilie James, a water polo coach at St Andrew's Cathedral School, a school that many Wentworth students go to, was brutally murdered. In her family's words, Lilie was vibrant, outgoing and very much loved by her family and friends. Her murder was a senseless act of violence and was deeply felt by people in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety per cent of Australians recognise this as a national issue, but many of them still think it's far away. The harsh reality is that it happens every single day, and it happens close to home. Domestic violence is not confined to any particular area, age, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. The perpetrator might be the father of her children, a well-respected community figure and a good bloke. We must confront the truth that someone we care for or even look up to might be capable of such violence. We must place the responsibility where it belongs—not on the woman's actions, but on the choices of the man who killed her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence doesn't emerge in a vacuum. It thrives in environments where boys are taught to feel entitled to relationships, to sex, to decision-making and to getting what they want—an environment where men rise to leadership positions despite harmful attitudes towards women and where women's roles are still sharply defined so that they shoulder the majority of parenting, housework, and care responsibilities. And fatal violence is almost always preceded by other forms of violence. Disturbingly, data from the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research indicates that coercive control behaviours are present in over half of all domestic violence incidents. While steps have been taken to criminalise coercive control in various states, we have a long way to go. Government has taken steps, but we have much more work to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have stepped forward in this parliament on steps like domestic violence leave, financial support and consent education. However, we have much further to go, including supporting grassroots organisations with consistent funding and better funding certainty so they know at the end of each financial year whether they will be able to offer services the next year; providing better data more quickly; providing more consistent definitions of violence across our different states and territories; ensuring that we actually undertake early intervention to stop violence at its source; ensuring that we make it easier to prosecute violence against women; and, finally, ensuring that we have an environment that empowers women economically. That means increasing paid parental leave and getting more men involved in caring, because we know that, if women continue to shoulder the domestic burdens in amounts disproportionate to those for men, they don't have the same economic strength, and this feeds into violence, into coercive control and, I think, into the culture of men and women that we still have in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I wrap up, I want to pay tribute to the people in Wentworth who are making amazing strides in this area. We have Bondi Beach Cottage, which provides counselling, child care and support; With You We Can with Sarah Rosenberg, who provides a pathway and explanation for how to prosecute violence against women; ReLove with Ren Fernando and Ben Stammer, who last week held a fundraiser where they talked about providing furniture for those people escaping domestic violence; the Lokahi Foundation, which provides long-term support; and, finally, Chanel Contos, who has done so much to advance consent education amongst young people in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Saturday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. In South Australia, it marked the end of a week where four women were killed by current or former partners—four horrific deaths. In Adelaide, thousands of women and their supporters joined Rotary, Zonta and other organisations to march to the Pioneer Women's Memorial, and I want to quote some of the words spoken at the rally by Deirdre Flynn, director of client services at Catherine House. Deirdre spoke about the need to provide some practical takeaways to keep hope alive through personal and collective acts of courage and to be truthful about where we are, because it was a really tough day and a very tough week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women and their supporters have been on this journey for a long time, and, for all the progress that we've made, women are still being killed or subjected to controlling and violent relationships. The awful, painful truth we must confront is that violence and murder of women will continue until we have the courage and moral fortitude to dismantle every enabling system and shut down every person or structure that resists the reconstruction of a culture of respect where women can live and move freely without fear, harassment and violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are definitely things government can do to respond to this national emergency, and I welcome the South Australian government's introduction of laws to criminalise coercive control, as a community we cannot remain idle. We each have the power to make a difference. And please know this: you should light the fire within you to do more. I'm talking about using courage as a force for change in the form of both action and resistance—courage to be what you choose, with a quiet whisper or a bold, audacious act. It can be what you choose for it to be. Courageous people can create a revolution. History has shown us this. We can each make active choices, push back on disrespect and violence, and take action to build positive cultures and models of healthy relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To women everywhere I say: if you are experiencing domestic or family violence and have not confided in anyone, resist his shame that keeps this a secret. Act by finding someone safe to tell. For all of us, knowledge is power. Learn about the signs of domestic and family violence and coercive control. Learn about healthy relationships. Teach your children about healthy, respectful relationships. Resist the urge to ignore, defend or minimise bad behaviour. It takes courage to question the safety of your relationship. For men, it takes courage to resist in engaging in the harmful banter that occurs within some male groups and settings, but if you fail to act you become part of the problem rather than a leader who has the power to create change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For us all, it takes courage to admit someone we know could be hurting a woman. We must resist the urge to do nothing because we don't want to interfere or make it awkward. We can learn how to safely support. Let us all activate our courage, be open and ready to respond if someone confides in us, and learn about resources and supports we can direct people to. Resist the urge to downplay what they are sharing due to discomfort. It takes courage to speak the truth of what we are seeing and hearing. It takes courage to act to address the indifference encountered about male violence. Resist doing nothing. Ask your workplace to run training. Provide resources for women and for men interested in positive behaviour change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, no country anywhere has figured out how to reach those men who value women so little that they are prepared to lose everything to enact a fatal revenge by ending a woman's life. We must have the courage to confront this frightening truth and use this to propel widespread surges of action and strong resistance everywhere it's called for. Until there is an end to male violence, we can all be the eyes and ears, a resource for women needing support, and be there for men who need or want help to stop their violence. I want to thank Deirdre for her inspiring and comforting words. This is a community-wide issue that requires community-wide action and a community-wide culture change, and we all need to play our part in this movement. Lives literally depend on it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I'm pleased to rise in support of this motion by the member for Newcastle at the start of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence. I recognise that, while positive steps have been taken in recent years to reduce violence against women and protect victims-survivors, much more needs to be done. Last Saturday 25 November was the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. On the Saturday before that, at a suburban home in Perth, a 63-year-old woman, a mother and grandmother, was murdered inside her home—another woman killed in the very place that should have been her sanctuary. We're repeatedly told that a woman is killed every week in Australia by someone known to them. I wonder if we're becoming immune to this fact. It's an outrageously alarming statistic. This year it's even worse than one a week. In the 47th week of the year, more than 65 women have allegedly been murdered in Australia. That's one every five days. How is it that this is still happening? Family and domestic violence don't occur in particular postcodes. In every electorate—Curtin, Cowan, O'Connor and all over the country—there are women and children for whom home is not a safe place to be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably the most common response when we start talking about violence at home is: 'Why doesn't she take the kids and leave? Why doesn't she report it to the police? I'd have up and left immediately if it were me.' But if you're not in this situation it can be really hard to understand the challenges. A recent report from Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety found that in many cases of domestic violence the perpetrators are middle-class men, well respected in their communities, with a low level of contact with the criminal justice system. Their abusive behaviour can be hidden from sight. They often control and monitor their partner's activities, with the violence escalating if they think she is contemplating leaving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Besides, where could they go? Right now in Western Australia we're witnessing a perfect storm of escalating rates of family violence, increasing living costs and the housing crisis. The rental vacancy in WA is currently at 0.7 per cent, with more than 30,000 people waiting for social housing. This means that a growing number of vulnerable women are remaining in violent and abusive situations to avoid risking homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently told about Jessica, a nurse working in one of Perth's hospitals, who was in exactly this situation. Jessica didn't head home at the end of her exhausting shift but instead took her car with all her possessions inside and went to the Safe Night Space East Perth. At the Safe Night Space she was able to access some basic amenities, such as a shower and kitchen facilities, plus support and a safe place to sleep. The alternatives for Jessica, who had no family support in Perth, were to return to her physically and psychologically abusive partner or to sleep in her car. Both options presented a high risk to her safety, and both options are unacceptable. The Safe Night Space, where Jessica had sought refuge, is an initiative of the City of Perth and Ruah Community Service. The service has been operating for 2½ years, with the city both funding the service and providing the building in East Perth. The City of Perth should be applauded for supporting such a service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, unless there's a last-minute reprieve, the Safe Night Space will close its doors next week when its contract with the City of Perth ends. After extensive lobbying, the state government has recently agreed to fund the service for the next two years, but the City of Perth is unwilling to extend the lease on the building where the service is operating, intending to convert it to 'community use'. Without an extension to the building lease, the Safe Night Space has no other options. There are no other premises available, and the service will close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With more than 17,000 people signing a petition to keep the Safe Night Space open at its current East Perth site, this tells me that the community, including many of my constituents, share the view that protecting women from violence is a very good use of a community asset. The City of Perth and the state government can take action to support women who are impacted by family and domestic violence by keeping the doors to the Safe Night Space in East Perth open. I couldn't think of a better way to start this important campaign. </span>

This month, November 2023, six women in Australia were killed in seven days, five allegedly by men. These deaths were preventable. Intimate partner violence is the biggest preventable threat to the health, wellbeing and safety of Australian women. Approximately one Australian woman is killed every nine days by a male intimate partner. Aboriginal women are 11 times more likely to die from family violence than non-Aboriginal women. Every fortnight in Australia a child is killed by a parent. Every two minutes across the country police are called to a family and domestic violence matter. Across south-east Melbourne, including my electorate of Goldstein, half of the police case load is family and domestic violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do more if we're going to end violence against women and children within a generation as the government's national plan sets out to do. That's why I've put forward this motion today. To quote former senator Natasha Stott Despoja's address to the National Foundation for Australian Women two weeks ago, 'We need to turbocharge our efforts.' Natasha is an eminent South Australian. In South Australia, four women were killed last week, allegedly by intimate partners. The list of killings goes on and on and on. I say to everyone in this place: what better time to speak to your communities than now, during the global 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence? Eliminating family violence requires leadership, coordination and investment to build the evidence base needed to identify definitive points of intervention, to prevent violence, to change perpetrator behaviour and ultimately to change the attitudes and inequalities that drive violence across the community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday the government announced that it'll resource the Australian Institute of Criminology to report quarterly on rates of intimate-partner homicide. Reporting matters, but it does not prevent. While I welcome this announcement, it doesn't address the full range of Australians killed by domestic, family and sexual violence. Child victims will be invisible in this reporting, a curious omission given the national plan's commitment to children as victims-survivors in their own right. Reporting via the dashboard will be retrospective, published once every three months. How is it that we can report live on the road toll but only four times a year on intimate-partner homicide and never on children killed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">State based and national road tolls have driven public awareness around road deaths and driver behaviour. This is why I'm calling on the government to establish the Australian family homicide prevention initiative to work in partnership with their announced dashboard and to generate the evidence required to prevent future deaths. It would provide the evidence base, tools and guidance required to inform improved intervention and prevention, document all acts of family violence related to homicides, and offer an independent assessment of when interventions could have taken place and what risks were present prior to those deaths. This would provide an accessible, interconnected data repository of all domestic and family violence related killings, for use by practitioners, policymakers, researchers and the media. It would sit well alongside the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children's goal to reduce the number of women killed by their intimate partners by 25 per cent each year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I thank the member for Goldstein for moving this motion in recognition of the national emergency that is violence perpetrated against women in Australia. I'd like to thank the member for Newcastle for moving her motion earlier today, and I thank all the speakers on this very troubling topic. There have been several speakers before me this morning who have highlighted the devastating impacts of intimate partner violence and domestic violence on women and their families, including their children, on communities and on the nation more broadly. The statistics are devastating. Approximately one Australian woman is killed every nine days by a male intimate partner. One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence perpetrated by a man since the age of 15—one in three. Aboriginal women, as the member for Goldstein noted, are 11 times as likely to die from family violence as non-Aboriginal women. There are 49 women who have been killed by acts of violence as of 17 November this year, 2023. We know that violence affects women of every age, from every cultural background, from different jobs and from different levels of education or income, living in different areas and leading different lives. No woman is immune, and this shouldn't be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, on 25 November, we marked the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, beginning 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. You'll have noticed, Deputy Speaker, some of us are wearing orange today in recognition of that. This global campaign calls on citizens to show how much they care about ending violence against women and girls and calls on governments worldwide to share how they are investing in gender based violence prevention. In Northern Tasmania a walk to end violence against women and girls will take place daily from today to 10 December, with the Migrant Resource Centre in Northern Tasmania and Citizen Tasmania leading the walk on Wednesday. It will be leaving from Launceston Town Hall at 12.30 pm and making its way across the city. Community members can join at any point along the route, and it will return to the town hall at 1.15 pm. In the south of the state the Tasman Bridge will be lit up in orange for a week in recognition of the period of activism. The importance of community activism cannot be overstated, and I take the member for Goldstein's point: so much more needs to be done by governments—federal, state, territory—and internationally, but community activism has a big role to play here as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence shows improving attitudes and understanding is a key method of prevention of sexual harm and violence. To improve attitudes and understanding, we need to improve awareness. The devastating statistics we are seeing of violence being perpetrated in homes across this country show how deep-seeded the cultural issues are. You only need to see the cesspit that is social media today to see the wanton misogyny that infects social media. The troubling values that lead to domestic and intimate partner violence are breeding new perpetrators, and I can't help but feel that social media is breeding new perpetrators in the way relationships with women are fomented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to the goal of ending violence against women and children in one generation. It's a lofty goal but it's one we are committed to. We are taking immediate and practical steps to prevent violence against women. We legislated 10 paid days of family and domestic violence leave for all employees, including casuals. People shouldn't have to choose between their own safety and their children's safety without losing income or their job completely. Regular income is an important aspect of family stability, and these 10 days give women the time to act and make the life plans necessary to escape a dangerous situation; they can get to removalists, see a lawyer and do all the things that need to be done to escape domestic violence. Our Housing Australia Future Fund will help deliver the government's commitment to 30,000 new social and affordable homes in just five years, and that includes 4,000 homes for women and children impacted by domestic and family violence. We have boosted funding for consent education, with $3.5 million in direct funding to Teach Us Consent, as part of a broader package of measures targeting sexual violence and consent announced in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As violence against women continues to plague Australian communities, we must take important steps to address violent behaviour before it starts. I can't help but repeat that; that is the most important thing to me. We need to reach kids, particularly boys before they become men, and change their values early so they can respect women later in life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I start today by thanking the member for Goldstein for bringing this motion to the House. Along with others on this crossbench, the member has been an incredibly strong advocate in this place for women's safety since coming here 18 months ago. I thank her for continuing to ensure it stays front and centre on our agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While many of us turn our minds to end-of-year celebrations, based on this year's track record up to seven women could lose their lives at the hands of somebody they have loved before this year ends. The sad truth is: while we may anticipate it based on our experience so far this year, we simply do not have the systems or information to enable us to move in a meaningful way to stop it. Instead it will be the headlines we read or the news we hear that will tell us where and when it has happened, and by then our concern will be worth little to the grieving families and communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As this motion asserts, we are in the middle of a national emergency. Yet just how far that emergency spreads, how deeply it simmers and how effectively our efforts to address it are working are simply not known because, as a country, we do not have a dedicated national real-time tracking mechanism. We know that last year 56 women were killed by their intimate partner in the space of 52 weeks. That's more than one woman a week—one daughter, one sister, one friend, one mother, one colleague. Whilst you would think a number like that would have been enough to shock us into action, 2023 has been worse, with one woman killed every five days in Australia. Alarmingly, Aboriginal women are 11 times more likely to die from family violence than are non-Aboriginal women. Devastatingly, a child is killed by a parent once every two weeks in our country. This happens even though our police are called to family or domestic violence matters every two minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This violence is not confined to a particular postcode. In my electorate of North Sydney, services to support women and families experiencing violence, overbearing control and coercion are overwhelmed and simply unable to meet the growing demand. There would not be a week that goes by where my team and I would not receive a call from a woman desperate for assistance, and I'm sure that, as a member in this place, my experience is not isolated. Surely, then, we should be doing everything in our power to both identify those at risk much earlier and ensure our systems enable us to deploy resources efficiently and effectively to stop this horrendous loss of life, for each of these deaths is preventable. We do need more accommodation, we do need more professional assistance and we do need to flip the system on its head, enabling those that are currently cast as victims to be put in a position of power whilst those who commit the violence are forced to face the consequences of their actions sooner and get help where appropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite the tragedy we see play out time and again, tangible action has been too slow. Ideas that have been floated for months, if not years, on how to stop this loss of life have been waiting for someone with the political will to pick them up. That political will has arrived with the crossbench of this 47th Parliament. Along with the member for Goldstein and others, I commit to ensuring North Sydney's voice is heard consistently advocating for us to do better. It is past time the Australian government established and funded a dedicated real-time national toll to accurately track and record fatal violence against women and children, because national real-time reporting mechanisms work. They focus the system's attention on providing valuable insight into whether interventions are working. Just look at the improvement of our road safety, as the member for Goldstein said, since the introduction of national road tolls, or at the increase in the detection of diseases such as breast and bowel cancer since we started tracking them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To shift something, you must be able to see it for what it is, and to see it for what it is you must be able to measure it. That's why I am proud to add my community's voice to the voices from Goldstein who are calling on the government to go further than it currently has and establish the Australian Family Homicide Index. Once established, this index would ensure all acts of family violence related homicides are documented, and it will provide us with the tools required to develop improved intervention and prevention practices. At the same time, it will also enable independent assessments of interventions and risks and, importantly, provide accessible data that those working in this area can use to inform their work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's not a solution in and of itself, this work, combined with other initiatives under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children could very well be the piece that finally shifts the dial—a dial that is well past due to be turned. So let's turn it.</span>

                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I rise to add my voice this morning to the calls from this place around the notions that family and domestic violence is preventable and that it's up to legislators to ensure that we get these things right. I'm proudly a member of the Albanese Labor government, where Minister Rishworth has announced that our intention is to make a difference in a generation. I am reminded, when I think about it, of some of the work that happened in the state of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luke Batty lost his life in February 2014, and it's fair to say it shook the country. We've had data since then of the number of women murdered annually, but, if we go back to 2014, we see it was a pivotal year in my state of Victoria, the state the member for Goldstein also represents, where Minister Fiona Richardson came to the fore as the first Minister for Prevention of Family Violence in Australia, with the first royal commission and with the first mention of measuring the toll: the Family Violence Index. It was a breakthrough moment—one that many people around this country probably saw as just another day in politics. It wasn't just another day in politics. It changed the way we view family and domestic violence. It changed the way we talk about it, but it also changed people's understanding. One of the bottom-line things that came through that royal commission was the notion that the cause of family and domestic violence was a lack of gender equity, and that is undeniable. If we had gender equity, we could drive these terrible figures down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to pay tribute today to my friend Fiona Richardson—who, of course, has now left us—for her work for the royal commission that happened in Victoria and has driven so much of the work around the country, and for driving home that notion that we measure what we care about and that, when we measure things, things change. We measured the economy, CPI and all sorts of other things because we think they're important. The notions around family and domestic violence, the measurement of it and how that will impact us are at work here in this place. As my colleague mentioned, the family and domestic violence leave legislation, which provides 10 days of leave, will help us to measure the incidence of family and domestic violence. As I've said in this place countless times—not to be too cynical—when there's an economic cost to it, suddenly the world will pay attention. Suddenly it won't be about bruises; it will be about money. Sadly, I think, that will see more action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is very important that, nearly 10 years ago, Fiona Richardson led change in the state of Victoria. That change is proudly picked up here in this place, the federal parliament, by Minister Rishworth and Minister Gallagher in their roles in the Labor government. I look forward to those changes coming in for us to be measuring the things that we are now going to be measuring so that we can set the baselines and make sure that we're driving those things backwards rather than forwards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, there's an ever-increasing cost-of-living crisis under the watch of this Prime Minister, this Treasurer, and this Labor government, and this issue is showing no signs of easing. It is now 18 months since the Prime Minister and the Labor government were elected. When Labor came to government, they promised they had all the answers to the cost-of-living crisis. But, as I've said many times in this place, don't listen to what they say; look at what they actually do, because nine times out of 10 they are two completely and utterly different things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did those opposite promise? They promised to reduce your electricity bills by $275. Instead, electricity prices have gone up 18 per cent and gas has gone up by 28 per cent. Millions of Australians have just been hit by another interest rate rise, the 12th since this government was elected. Interest rates are now at their highest level since 2011, and rents are experiencing their highest increase since 2009. Australia's inflation is higher than that of almost every major advanced economy. Food and grocery prices are up by 8.2 per cent, housing prices are up by 10.4 per cent, and insurance is up by 17.3 per cent. Inflationary pressures have compounded these increases, with Australians finding that their pay cheques are not going as far as they did a year ago, exactly the opposite of what those opposite, the current Labor government, promised. In addition to that, we've seen productivity collapse, and we are now in a GDP per capita recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But do those opposite have a plan? I'd venture to suggest that, no, they don't. Labor's plan to deal with these issues is completely and utterly non-existent. In fact, they have left it up to the Reserve Bank to try and deal with it alone and bring down these inflationary pressures. But the Reserve Bank has but one tool, and that is interest rates. It places increasing pressure on dealing with this inflationary problem fairly and squarely on the shoulders of mortgage holders and also, by extension, those who are renting because the landlords who have mortgages are putting up their rents in response to interest rate increases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local residents in my electorate of Forde consistently rank cost of living as their No. 1 issue, with just under 40 per cent of the residents in my electorate having a mortgage. If they have an average mortgage of some $500,000—or a bit more in many cases—they are now being forced to pay an additional $1,200 per month in interest repayments alone in a climate where real wages for working families have fallen by around five per cent over the last 12 months. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing energy costs are inflating the price of goods and services across the country. That's something those opposites seem to forget—electricity is in everything that we buy right across our economy. So electricity prices going up by 18 per cent feeds directly into the inflationary problem. That is a direct result of deliberate government policy. So, unless those opposites are prepared to change those policies, that problem is not going to go away. It does not matter how much the Reserve Bank increases interest rates by, it's deliberate government policy that is directly impacting the rate of inflation. It is only those opposites that can change it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, we saw the Minister for Climate Change and Energy make matters worse through a decision to write a blank cheque on behalf of taxpayers to bring more renewables online. If renewables are truly the cheapest source of energy, surely it wouldn't require subsidies to achieve those outcomes? The costs won't be outlined, but you can be sure that it will mean an increased cost in your energy bill, with this cost feeding through to all sectors of the economy, exacerbating our inflationary pressures. This government has no plan to ease the cost-of-living pressure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Right now there is probably no bigger issue for local people than the cost of living. Whether it is rent, mortgages, medicines, groceries or petrol, it does seem that everything is going up and up. But one of the challenges for government is finding ways to help people with these costs that don't in fact make the problem worse. If in response to rising inflation you pump too much money into the wrong places, what you end up with is more inflation. That's why the 10-point plan the Albanese government has developed on cost of living is targeted to the areas of highest need that will have the least impact on inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have targeted our support to low-income earners and those doing it the toughest because it doesn't encourage them to spend; it helps them keep their heads above water. In fact, the ABS September quarter data shows that the measures we have developed took half a percentage point off inflation. The policies we have put in place since coming to government are actually making a difference to people and the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health, always high on the agenda for people in my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast, has had a major boost. As of November, we have tripled the bulk-billing incentive to help children, pensioners and concession cardholders access a bulk-billing GP. Not only does this help them but it also helps GPs. I have heard that local doctors in my electorate have started bulk-billing again, and local GPs have told me what a difference this policy is making to them. Our indexation boost on Medicare payments is also ensuring local GPs are getting the biggest helping hand they have had in years. On top of this, we have freed up countless GP appointments and halved the cost of many common medicines with our cheaper medicines policy. Coming from an area with high rates of chronic disease and a GP crisis that has escalated for years, this is extremely welcome news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the scare campaign that was run and the cries that the sky would fall in, it didn't, and local people are feeling the benefit of that. People with a Medicare card buying just one of the medicines covered by this policy will save up to $180 per year. That is on top of our reduction to the general co-payment, which brought the cost of medicines down from $42.50 to $30 from January. No-one should be choosing between food and medicine, and if people are healthy they can also continue contributing more fully to our economy—so many benefits!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that electricity is one of the areas hurting the most, so we've given electricity bill rebates of up to $500 to around five million households to help families, working parents and children alike. We've made child care cheaper, helping families on incomes of $120,000 with one child in care to save around $1,700 a year. That's benefiting around 4,800 local families in my electorate. That makes a very big difference to the family budget. It's another one that also has dual benefit for our economy, because it's helping parents, particularly mothers, get back into the workforce. At the same time, we're expanding paid parental leave to 26 weeks by 2026. How great is that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The No. 1 cost for so many these days is housing. We know house prices are rising, access to affordable housing is at all-time lows and rents are skyrocketing. Our Housing Australia Future Fund will invest $10 billion to build more social and affordable housing along with our $140 million Housing Accord, and we've increased Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent, benefiting 1.1 million households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former TAFE teacher, I could not be more proud that we've made TAFE fee free for tens of thousands of students, because TAFE changes lives, and it benefits our economy, giving us the skilled workers we need now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as bringing costs down, we have also made a big difference to the money coming into households. We've boosted income support payments by $40 per fortnight, and we've gotten wages moving again. Since we came to government, wages have been growing at an average rate of 3.6 per cent, compared with 2.1 per cent under the previous government. We've increased the minimum wage and boosted award wage earnings for our lowest paid workers, and we've given aged-care workers a 15 per cent pay rise. We're working hard, and we will keep working hard every single day to support those who need it most while ensuring we are helping our economy, not making things worse.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Forde. The cost of living is the government's primary responsibility to the people of Australia. If they don't deliver an economic strategy that enables everyday Australians, like those in my seat of Longman, to not suffer financially, they are not fulfilling their duty. Unfortunately, we are seeing the exact opposite right now. People are losing jobs as the unemployment rate slowly starts to rise. We see homelessness increase as mortgages and rents rise and become unaffordable, and we see more families fall apart as the financial burden becomes simply too great. This lack of economic management simply damages lives—in some cases, forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's forget the politics here and look simply at the results since this government took office. In just over a year, food and grocery prices are up by 8.2 per cent, insurance is up by 17.3 per cent, electricity is up by 18.2 per cent, petrol is up by 19 per cent, and interest rates have increased 12 times under this government. Have there been factors that have driven this? Of course, but there always are. Whether it be an overseas conflict like Operation Desert Storm, Afghanistan, the Ukraine invasion, the seemingly never-ending conflicts in the Middle East, the GFC or a global pandemic, there always have been and always will be factors that can impact our economy. But it is the job of the government of the day to implement policies that mitigate and minimise the impacts that these factors will have on the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the recent COVID pandemic. The former coalition government implemented initiatives like JobKeeper, increased the instant asset write-off, gave a one-off tax relief for small business, halved the fuel excise and introduced the $1,500 tax relief incentive for hardworking Australians, to name just a few. The result? Real outcomes—like the lowest unemployment rate in five decades, the lowest personal and credit card debt as a percentage in decades, low interest rates of around two per cent, the highest personal savings in years and an economy that was booming. Governments must be judged on results. They must be judged on what they actually deliver, not what they say they will deliver. If you do this, clearly these results and history show that Australians are simply better off under a coalition government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data is irrefutable. A family in my electorate of Longman with a mortgage of $500,000 is now paying an extra $16,000 per year in mortgage repayments, or just over an extra $300 per week. This is simply unsustainable for many of these hardworking Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are we seeing this cost-of-living crisis? There are many factors. However, a large portion of it is to do with a government led by a prime minister who has his priorities all wrong. Their entire focus in their first 12 months of government was the divisive Voice referendum. Instead of focusing on the real issue of the cost of living, they devoted much of their time and effort to a referendum that they were told very early on was not going to get up. There was $450 million spent on this referendum that could have been spent on cost-of-living relief—measures like halving the fuel excise, just to name one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are claiming a budget surplus that is a result of the previous coalition government's excellent economic management during the pandemic. They fail to mention that, if we'd adopted all their suggested measures during the pandemic, there would have been an extra $80 billion in spending, which would have resulted in there being no budget surplus, just another budget deficit. Worse still, Labor has added an extra $188 billion in spending since coming to office, and this, of course, only feeds inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank governor has clearly stated that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors right here in Australia, not by overseas factors. This is in clear contrast with the Prime Minister's and Treasurer's statements. They are blaming the rest of the world for their failures on inflation, instead of doing what strong leaders do, which is—instead of complaining and passing the buck—to get on with the job of finding solutions to the issues they face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a coalition government will get Australia back on track through supporting, not hindering, small business, and by delivering lower taxes and a simpler tax system, along with cutting expensive red tape that drives inflation. They will support more Australians into work, instead of encouraging people to remain on welfare, which destroys their self-worth and value. Australians feel conned by this government and the promises that it made at the last election, and rightly so.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for bringing on this motion. It is indeed a very important issue, probably the most important issue the government are facing, and we've known that since before the election. The cost of living was absolutely at the top of our agenda even before the election. Why? Because the cost of living was getting out of control even under the Liberals, when they were in power, and certainly inflation and interest rates have gone up since. Those opposite might need to remember that interest rates are set by the Reserve Bank of Australia, not the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker, the member for Longman, said the government needed to say what it was doing. I've made a few short notes here. We've backed in higher wages. For the first time in more than a decade, there's actually a government in control that backs higher wages for workers. I can't think of a single measure that is more important for family budgets than higher wages in the pay packet coming through the door. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're backing in cheaper child care. That's making a material difference to people who require child care, and it allows parents, usually women, to go back to work for those extra few days because they can afford to do so now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've actually made medicines cheaper. PBS medicines have come down from a maximum of $42.60 to $30. It's a material difference in the cost of medicines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's fee-free TAFE—a raging success across the country. Those opposite, of course, derided it, dismissed it and opposed it. Fee-free TAFE is a raging success in my state of Tasmania, where, I note, there is a Liberal state government that is backing it 100 per cent. Fee-free TAFE is making a real difference to people, enabling them to get the qualifications they require to go out and get a job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the strongest jobs growth in Australian history of any new government: 330,000 new jobs in our first year. And, after a decade of inaction and policy failure, we've got energy policy certainty and investment flowing through again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are some of the things we are doing. But there's no hubris on this side of the chamber. We know that many families out there are hurting—really hurting—with these interest rate rises, these mortgage rates, and we are doing all we can to provide cost-of-living relief and to make sure we get inflation back into the target range. It is for that reason that our cost-of-living relief measures are being rolled out in such a way as to not add to the inflationary burden. We haven't taken the easy road like those opposite and just handed out thousands of dollars in handouts, which then adds to inflation. We have done targeted cost-of-living relief measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have those opposite done over the past year and a half in terms of contributing to the government's agenda on cost-of-living relief? They've said no to everything. When we proposed energy bill relief, they said no. We managed to get that legislation through the parliament, and it has made a material difference to the upward trajectory of power bill prices. It has made a real difference, and that is reflected in all the stats. So, while we are making policy, creating legislation to tackle the cost of living, those opposite are just saying no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago I received an email from Josh, who lives in Bridgewater in the south of my electorate. Josh is a young man, married, raising a young family with his partner. He and his wife both work full-time, and they've recently purchased a home with a mortgage that they are paying off. He contacted me to let me know that he is feeling the pressure from the increased cost of living. As a mortgagee and a father he's acutely aware of the pinch being felt across the country by many working families. But there's good news. He told me his family is benefiting from the government's cheaper child care. Because of our cheaper child care policy, Josh and his partner are both able to re-enter the workforce, meaning more income for their family and more productivity for the country. He asked me what else we are doing to bring down inflation and cost-of-living pressures, and I was happy to advise him of the measures I have annotated here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government recognises the challenge of the cost of living on household budgets in this country. It is the No. 1 issue, certainly in my electorate. Tackling inflation is a national effort. Mortgagees are playing their part in bringing down the inflation burden. I'd like to see others in the community, particularly corporations, do a bit more to bring down price pressures, and I'll certainly have more to say on that in days to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I'm very pleased to support this motion regarding the cost of living, because it is simply acknowledging reality. It is a truth that those opposite hate to admit and struggle to explain to their constituents that it has not been easy under Prime Minister Albanese. Since Labor was elected the cost of living has increased dramatically. In just 15 short months food and grocery prices are up by 8.2 per cent, housing prices have increased by 10.4 per cent, insurance is up by 17.3 per cent, electricity is up by 18.2 per cent and gas is up by a whopping 28 per cent. And we know that millions of Australians have been hit hard by the 12 interest rate rises that have occurred under this government. With interest rates rising to their highest level since 2011, families with a mortgage of $750,000 are now paying an extra $24,000 per year on repayments. The rising cost pressures are being felt right across the country and are often just too hard to juggle, particularly when we consider that real wages for a working family have fallen by five per cent in the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incredibly, there are now more Australians relying on hardship programs than there were during the peak of the pandemic. We've had wonderful charities like Foodbank WA confirm that they are now assisting dual-income households, a demographic they could never have expected to be supporting. It's hard to believe that in the lucky country that we call Australia, that we call home, there are mums and dads who are both working, both earning an income, yet unable to put food on the table for their family. This is heartbreaking for proud Australian parents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the rising cost of living repeatedly being highlighted as the No. 1 concern amongst everyday Australians, the Prime Minister has not developed a serious plan to address the crisis that this government is largely responsible for. Last week we had the governor of the Reserve Bank confirm that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors. This was no shock, considering that, since coming to government, Labor has added $188 billion in spending, only making inflation worse, and that's just one example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has chosen to bring in a staggering record number of migrants, meaning Australia's population is growing at its highest rate in 70 years, with this government intending to bring in some 1.5 million people over the next five years. There's just one problem: where are they all going to live? This is such recklessness. Is it any wonder we are seeing record low rental vacancy rates? Renters are now experiencing the highest increases in rent since 2009, and the dream of home ownership is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine, with the CEO of ANZ recently warning that home loans are becoming only for the rich.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is their reckless energy policy, which has set a target of 82 per cent renewables by 2030, rising rapidly from the current mark of 30 to 35 per cent. Of course, this transition is not free and is driving up the price of electricity, which is a key driver of inflation. This is just another broken promise. Before the election we were told time and time again that, under Labor, Australians would save $275 a year on electricity. Instead—well, we all know what's happening—they are now paying well above what they were paying before the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of being focused on bringing down the cost of living, the Albanese government has spent all its time and energy elsewhere. At the same time they are trying to avert blame, saying that this has nothing to do with them and that it is all being driven by global factors. If that's the case, then why is our inflation higher than that of most developed countries?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the Prime Minister promised to make tackling the cost of living a priority. Since then, he's not developed a plan to curb inflation and has been focusing on the wrong priorities. This is a real crisis, and we need our Prime Minister to focus on what's important for everyday Australians. So I call on the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to do their jobs and come up with a real plan to combat the cost of living, because every day they refuse to address this crisis Australians are hurting, and Australians deserve so much better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  In the last decade, under the former Liberal-National government, Australia suffered. It was a government that simply did not take the action needed to deal with the cost of living. Even as they saw the issues year after year and budget after budget, they left Australian households to fend for their own against some enormous structural problems within our economy. Not once did they actually consider dealing with the long-term cost-of-living issues. It was always the quick fix for them—or even, sometimes, no fix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians across the country and in my electorate of Bennelong have had to pay for the consequences of the coalition's inaction. People in Bennelong and across the country live in a truly cooked housing market, inspired by the coalition's lack of attention to supply. Their wages were stagnant because of the lack of action and the design of the former government's policy. Child care rose by almost 50 per cent under their watch, and their lack of clarity and vision on energy policy has left our national energy market a mess, one that, like all other areas, this government has spent the last 18 months trying to clean up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cost-of-living pressures are not one-offs. None of them were sudden. These were generational problems amplified by years of failure by those opposite. But what I find extraordinary is that, when government relief and solutions that have been factually proven to limit and sometimes reduce inflation are proposed, those opposite have the audacity to argue that there is no plan or that there has been no relief for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The absurdity of this motion and of this opposition is that they come here into this place and say that there is no plan, when they are actively opposing policy and legislation that proves that there is a plan. They complain about energy prices when they voted down energy price relief. They say that healthcare costs are going up whilst they oppose elements of our cheaper medicines plan. And they blame migrants for our housing crisis when they did nothing for 10 years on housing supply and then they voted against policy which would increase housing supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands that household budgets are tight and that the impacts of cost-of-living pressures and inflation are being felt around the country. That's why we just won't sit on our hands while Australians are struggling, and that's why we are out in our electorates and in this place every single day working to address inflation and cost-of-living challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, for one, know that there is more to do in this space. Our plan to date exists—it's real—and it involves energy bill relief, cheaper child care, increased Medicare bulk-billing rates, reduced medicine costs, boosted income support payments, enhanced rental assistance, fee-free TAFE and training, increased affordable housing, expanded paid parental leave and real efforts to stimulate wage growth. And we're doing this all at the same time as we have delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years, which is putting downward pressure on inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this plan is working because the facts show it is. ABS data indicates that without our cost-of-living policies CPI would have been approximately half a percentage point higher throughout this year. In this September quarter alone, we saw that electricity prices increased by 4.2 per cent. Without the government's intervention, they would have surged by 18.6 per cent. Childcare costs have decreased by 13.2 per cent as a result of our policy we took to the election. Without these adjustments costs would have increased by 6.7 per cent. Rents increased by 2.2 per cent, but because of our rental assistance—the highest increase in 30 years—this would have been 2.5 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also acknowledge that sometimes these programs are hard to understand and are hard to apply for, particularly for culturally and linguistically diverse communities like mine. That's why I'm one of many MPs that's actually doing something about it. On 11 December I'll be hosting a cost-of-living help hub in Eastwood, where I'll be bringing together government and non-government services like Services Australia, Centrelink, Service NSW, CCA New South Wales and the Energy and Water Ombudsman so that people in Bennelong can talk to people and access the support that is available to them. I will also be providing services to translate into Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean for people who need it. Providing cost-of-living support isn't just about good policy—it's about making sure people get access to it, and that's what this government is doing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government amendments respond to the recommendations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to explicitly include a requirement that an accrediting authority have appropriate internal controls and complaints processes under clause 25(1). It makes clear that this bill must continue certification practices already in place but not articulated in this legislation. The role of accrediting authorities in this bill is to approve certification bodies—that is, they audit the auditors. </span>

They have the power to withdraw accreditation from auditors who do not meet the requirements of the audit scheme. Requiring accrediting authorities to have appropriate internal controls and complaint processes ensures that, at each level of quality and safeguarding arrangements, there is recourse to complain or appeal against an outcome. </span>

This is consistent with the intent of the bill and was already indicated in the explanatory memorandum, and so the government does support this amendment. </span>

They were supported by the opposition in the other place. We understand they respond to a recommendation by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. As the minister has outlined, they will add a legislative requirement for the secretary to be satisfied about internal controls and complaints processes. They will also provide that the secretary can revoke the approval of a person as an accredited authority if the secretary is no longer satisfied that the person meets the requirements under the new paragraph. These seem to be relatively straightforward and commonsense amendments, and we will therefore be supporting them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms THWAITES:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—Australia's election system is strong, and our democracy and our democratic institutions are highly regarded around the world. But we cannot be complacent. Here in Australia, as is the case across the Western world, we find there is a drift from democracy. There are people losing faith in democracy—losing faith in electoral systems and those they elect. We saw what can happen when people lose faith in democratic institutions play out most dramatically in the United States on 6 January.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the evidence the committee heard through this inquiry, we heard the need for reform to ensure we can continue to hold Australians' trust in our electoral system. This includes providing for more transparency around where election donations come from. It includes reducing the potentially corrupting influence of big money and the risk of an electoral arms race where election campaigns continue to cost more and more. And it includes assuring the community that they can trust what they hear from their politicians during election campaigns in an age of rising misinformation and disinformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence put to the committee demonstrated that we are seeing increasingly large amounts of money being spent on election campaigns, including from individuals with deep pockets. At the 2022 election, Clive Palmer spent more than $100 million to try and have a disproportionately large influence over the outcome. Our elections must remain a contest of ideas rather than a contest of who can spend the most. They must remain a contest of ideas rather than a contest of those who can spend big on advertising spreading untruths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in our interim report, the committee made a series of recommendations to tackle these issues. These include: lowering the donation disclosure threshold to $1,000 and introducing real-time disclosure; introducing donation and spending caps for elections; and introducing truth-in-political-advertising laws. These recommendations are for substantial reform. They're based on the evidence the committee heard from constitutional and legal experts, from integrity groups and civil society organisations, and from the general public. While they are substantial, in the main they are not untested. Many of our states and territories have been ahead of us at a Commonwealth level to introduce reforms to provide for more transparency and to limit the influence of big money on elections. I do want to thank the Special Minister of State for giving the committee terms of reference that allowed us to do this substantial, much-needed piece of work to recommend reform that's been put in the too-hard basket for too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on our interim report, in our final report the committee looked more closely at issues around improving representation and encouraging participation and enfranchisement. On improving representation, the committee has recommended increased Senate representation for the two territories. The ACT and the Northern Territory should be appropriately represented in parliament. It's clear both are very different from what they were when the representation for the original states was put into our Constitution at Federation, and they are still different from when they were granted territory representation in 1973. Hence, the committee has recommended an increase to their number of senators from two to four.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is also requesting a specific inquiry reference into increasing the size of the House of Representatives. The evidence presented to the committee showed us that, by international standards, Australians are underrepresented in their national parliament, and our country's geography compounds the distance between many Australians and their elected representatives. However, given the many big issues the committee were grappling with during this inquiry, we didn't feel like this topic attracted the breadth and depth of submissions and evidence we would have liked, and hence we have requested a referral for further work on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On encouraging participation and enfranchisement, the committee has a series of recommendations to ensure that all Australians can vote in ways appropriate to their needs, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disabilities, older Australians and Australians living overseas. We've also recommended that the AEC be resourced to continue to deliver the independent, secure and well-run elections that Australians can rightly be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to some of our earlier themes, the committee has also recommended that the government clarify and modernise the definitions of key terms in the Electoral Act, including 'electoral matter', 'electoral expenditure' and 'third party'; that, contingent on truth in political advertising laws being introduced, the government also remove the media blackout period in the lead-up to each election; and that the government amend the process for distributing postal vote applications in line with community expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proposing changes to electoral laws is something many people in this place feel strongly about. It is tempting for all of us to retreat to our bunkers about how reforms might affect us and, once again, put change in the too-hard basket. But all of us in this parliament need our community to have trust in us, in our elections and in our democratic systems to allow us to do the work that we are sent here to do. So I urge every parliamentarian to consider the evidence the committee has gathered through more than 1,500 submissions and 11 public hearings and the recommendations we have made as a result of that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say thanks to all the committee members for their efforts and the committee secretariat for their hard work over the past 15 months on both this report and the interim report. With a record number of submissions on a wide range of topics, I am grateful for all the help they brought to the inquiry, particularly Joel Bateman, our committee secretary, who steered this inquiry through to its completion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  by leave—I am really pleased to see this report being tabled and I support the recommendations in it subject to my additional comments in that report. The final JSCEM report repeats the recommendations of the interim report relating to transparency, truth and reducing money in politics. We have heard from the chair about the importance of those areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the report finalised, it is now time for government to respond to this report. I introduced a private member's bill called the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Restoring Trust) Bill after the interim report. That contained 13 reforms that have the really broad support of the crossbench, academics, think tanks, civil society organisations and the community. It would be great to see the government responding to those proposed reforms in a timely fashion. A response is needed fairly quickly because, if we are going to have these new reforms in place in time for the next election, there needs to be time to develop those frameworks and ensure that political parties and others have time to make the necessary changes. So there is some urgency around it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has said it wants consensus on electoral reform, but we have seen that the opposition is opposing transparency and truth in its dissenting comments and public statements and is also interested in designing caps that will prevent future competition in politics. This report talks about caps. The final report adds an exemption from caps for charities. On caps, design is really key. Caps can have the impact of locking in the major parties. No-one wants to see a billionaire swaying the outcome of an election. That has broad community support. The 99.6 per cent of Australians who are not a member of a major political party don't want to see a reform that locks in the two-party system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, really, now the government has a choice. It can work with the opposition in responding to this report and potentially make some compromises on transparency and truth, which the community really cares about, and also put in place a caps structure that will lock in that two-party system or it has the option of working with the crossbench and the Greens in both houses to come up with a package that meets community need and allows political competition. Communities will be watching very closely to see whether the purpose of any reform package is to embed the two-party system or reflect community concerns about transparency and truth and restoring trust in our electoral system by allowing political choice. I am glad to see this report being finalised and look forward to seeing the government responding to it in a timely fashion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are important to improve the intent and quality of this legislation. Don't get me wrong; it is a good bill. Two key provisions, nonetheless, require amendment. The instant asset write-off and the energy incentive will no doubt go a long way in assisting small businesses feeling the immense pressure of inflation, interest rates and less consumer spending, amongst other issues. Small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy. They account for one-third of Australia's GDP and they need targeted support. At the moment small businesses are facing a perfect storm. At home, like all Australians, they are facing cost-of-living price increases and high mortgage rates, but they're also facing reduced revenue in their businesses as consumers spend less but energy prices increase. It's incredibly important that this bill actually achieve its intent by being well targeted. The amendments I am proposing, after consulting with the Manly Business Chamber, the Mosman Chamber of Commerce and the Warringah Chamber of Commerce in my electorate, and the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia—COSBOA—more broadly, give all small businesses certainty and bring forward cash, giving them the opportunity to get more back at tax filing time and allowing them more time to invest and reduce their energy bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the asset write-off, the amendments seek to increase the threshold for the instant asset write-off and the energy incentive bonus, taking the threshold from $20,000 to $50,000 respectively. Respectfully, for businesses to actually have the benefit of this provision, $20,000 is not sufficient. If we are talking about energy efficiency measures, whether it's rooftop solar, a battery, heat pumps and other efficiencies like LED lighting, these are all going to be much more significant than $20,000. If we genuinely want to support small businesses, it really needs to be increased to $50,000. Small businesses are struggling with their cashflows, and they really do need to do this. Nearly two-thirds of small-business owners recently cited concern about their ability to afford their energy bills. This incentive will go some way to help with that. I welcome the introduction of the energy incentive to support small businesses and to help them become energy independent and reduce their energy bills, but we need to make sure we're doing it in a meaningful way so that they can genuinely take advantage of this business policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue, going to these amendments I seek to move, is this. Let's be realistic; we're already halfway through this financial year, and this is a measure to give small businesses the benefit of this asset write-off in the 2023-24 tax year. When I've raised this with COSBOA and small businesses they've asked me if I'm joking, in the sense that we're halfway through this financial year and we haven't even passed this legislation but, somehow, this is the period in which these businesses are supposed to be able to take advantage of this provision. Most of them aren't even aware this is coming. From a cashflow point of view, the government is proposing that sometime in the new year—so January or February—this legislation will have passed, businesses can become aware of it and they can then make the decision of whether or not they can take advantage of this asset write-off. But they have to do so within the next six months and find the cashflow to do it. I propose an amendment that I think is a very reasonable one to the government—that this measure be extended to the 2024-25 financial year so that businesses genuinely have an opportunity to plan for these measures and write off significant assets to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government wants to be genuine in supporting small businesses in these kinds of measures and energy efficiencies, this amendment should be accepted, and this measure should be extended to the 2024-25 tax year. If not, it's really hard to understand where the motivation of the government is, other than window-dressing in this place for this measure and for this legislation, when so much of the time frame in which it will be available to the businesses has already passed. These are effective, simple amendments to genuinely help small businesses that are struggling and are calling on the government for greater assistance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise to strongly support the member for Warringah's amendments to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Support for Small Business and Charities and Other Measures) Bill 2023. These are sensible, practical amendments, and they'd increase the positive impact of the small business energy incentive. They would give businesses more time and money to plan and undertake energy efficiency and electrification works. The amendments extend the deadline for projects to be completed from 30 June 2024 to 30 June 2025. The amendments also increase the maximum amount of the bonus deduction under the small business energy incentive from $20,000 to a far more realistic $50,000. Finally, the amendments require the minister to table a report to parliament no later than mid-2025 to assess the effectiveness of the small business energy incentive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a long-time campaigner for greater government support to businesses and households to electrify and improve their energy efficiency, I support the bill. It's a good bill, but it is one that can be so much better. I believe these amendments would significantly improve the effectiveness of the bill in genuinely reducing energy costs and emissions for small businesses. Getting this bill right is critical, as energy bill pressures increase and as Australia charts a path towards net-zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are almost 15,700 small businesses in my electorate of Indi that will be eligible for this incentive, and many business owners across Indi have spoken to me of the increased cost of doing business at this time. They're facing rising energy bills. They are a major factor in their business budgets. At the same time, these businesses want to play a role in reducing emissions. This bill can help them to both reduce their energy bills and reduce our overall emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, without an extension of the time line for completing projects, many small businesses will be too hesitant to begin an energy efficiency project or electrification project. They fear that their project won't be completed by the 30 June 2024 deadline. With just seven months until this deadline as it stands, this bill isn't practical. For most small businesses, planning a project, finding available tradespeople and completing the project within seven months just isn't realistic. Any delays could mean small businesses outlay project costs and then find they are not eligible for this support. Extending the deadline to 30 June 2025 gives businesses more time and more certainty that they'll be able to complete the projects within the eligible period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending the deadline also allows for investments to be considered as part of long-term planning, which any business owner will tell you is necessary as they balance cash flow. Many business owners would see this and think, 'Great!' But then they may not be in a position to make such an investment right at this moment. Extending the deadline is needed to ensure the bill actually meets its objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing the maximum available bonus deduction under the incentive from $20,000 to $50,000 will provide businesses with more flexibility to choose the project that is best suited to their situation and best sets up their business for the future. This might mean undertaking large-scale projects, such as completely electrifying their business operations. It could allow a supermarket, for example, to install sufficient batteries to endure blackouts without having to rely on generators. It could allow wineries or dairies to improve efficiency and resilience by insulating tanks and coolrooms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses are calling out for support to reduce their energy bills. This appetite for action is underlined by the number and diversity of projects across my electorate that sought funding under the recent energy efficiency grants for small and medium-sized enterprises. The small business energy incentive is a fantastic opportunity to provide support to all small businesses, but the government needs to seriously consider these amendments put by the member for Warringah, because they will improve the effectiveness of the incentive. I strongly encourage the government to support these amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition amendments to this bill give effect to an extension of the instant asset write-off to 26,500 medium businesses and extend the value of assets eligible to $30,000. This will simplify depreciation for Australia's 3.6 million small to medium businesses, cutting red tape while boosting investment in productive assets to improve their businesses, lower their costs and, in turn, lower prices. This will drive productivity at a time when it has experienced a historic collapse under Labor, which will drive economic growth to fund the essential services Australians deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the temporary and targeted extensions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has ignored calls from business groups to lower the instant asset write-off threshold to levels not seen since the 2018-2019 financial year. The coalition amendments restore the instant asset write-off to the levels introduced in the 2019-2020 budget. This aligns the eligibility with that of the 25 per cent small-business company tax threshold and Labor's small-business energy incentive measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition understands that, when business owners can keep more of their own money, they're able to invest back into the business, boost productivity, grow the economy and create new and, most importantly, local jobs. The coalition amendments mean: firstly, that 26,500 businesses with aggregate turnover of up to $50 million will be eligible to use the instant asset write-off; secondly, that the asset threshold will increase from $20,000 to $30,000, allowing businesses to claim accelerated depreciation on a wider range of assets; and, thirdly, that businesses can invest in productive assets without putting pressure on inflation. I commend the amendments to the House.</span>

I was waiting in anticipation for the member for Barker to produce the documents that they have prepared themselves for the costings in relation to this measure or to refer to the costings that they have produced in relation to this measure. In both cases, there was deafening silence. This is relevant because, in about an hour's time, I am anticipating that the member for Hume will be puffing himself up in this place and talking about how the government is spending too much. At the same time, he's moving bills into this House which would require us to spend even more. We won't be doing that. We have carefully calibrated these measures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say, in relation to the measures that have previously been considered and moved by the member for Warringah, we thank the member for Warringah for the engagement that we've had in relation to these bills. We've had good-faith engagement with her and other members of the crossbench in relation to those measures. But we think, in combination, the two measures, the small-business energy incentive and the incident tax write-off measures, make up a $600 million package of relief and, together with the other measures that have been put in place by the government, they provide a good package of relief with the right incentives for small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say, however, that the points made by the member for Warringah in relation to the amendments she moved make a powerful case for the swift consideration and movement of these bills through both the House of Representatives and the other place. I commend all members of this place and the other place to do exactly that.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  For the Consideration in Detail stage, I just want to make a short contribution about schedules 1 and 2 of the bill and also to speak to the amendments moved by the opposition. In particular, schedule 2 implements the small-business energy incentive that was announced in the budget. This is one component of the $1.7 billion in electrification and energy efficiency that the Greens secured through negotiations with the government. On budget night, it was slated as a $314 million package, but the way that the legislation has been designed does raise real concerns for us about whether the full amount of money will be spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it only runs until the end of this financial year, which we're already deeply in, with only seven months remaining. That makes it impossible for any thought-through and methodical energy-saving investments to occur for many businesses. Some may have seen that this was coming and may have prepared for it, but many won't have, and many small-business owners are just too busy to manage a project in these short time frames.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, unfortunately, despite the announcement made in the budget, we're yet to see anything from the Treasury or the department to promote awareness of this scheme amongst small and medium-sized business owners. Thirdly, installing solar panels is specifically excluded for no readily apparent reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the equipment has to be installed ready for use by 30 June 2024, and questions were raised in the Senate committee hearings about whether that was going to be feasible and whether it was appropriate to be doing such significant work—involving electricity, obviously—in such a period of time. The last thing that we need at the moment is the forcing of important schemes into a tight deadline, so the schedule needs changing and the scheme needs to be extended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a final important area where the bill needs to be improved. This will put beyond doubt that the cost involved in disconnecting a business premises from the gas network is a capital expense and is therefore eligible to receive government support under schedules 1 and 2. If you're applying a High Court pronouncement, there may be some uncertainty over whether disconnecting from gas is an operating expense or a capital expense. If it is, these one-off network costs could take advantage of the energy incentive and the instant asset write-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to schedule 1. Because of the way in which the energy incentive scheme works, is it a 20 per cent bonus on top of any existing asset deduction scheme, such as the instant asset write-off in schedule 1? Again, rather than just legislating this for the next seven months until we have to legislate it again, it also needs to be extended. The opposition is moving an amendment to lift the value of assets that can be instantly written off from $20,000 to $30,000. Given that this will support the value of the small business energy incentive, we see no reason to object to this proposal, so the Greens will support this current amendment in the House, but we reserve our position on the bill as a whole and any amendments until the Senate debate commences.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come to this place, we take an oath of allegiance to a foreign monarch. I object to giving allegiance—and I have never, ever agreed to give allegiance—to a foreign monarch. I say my allegiance is to the sovereignty of the Australian people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I got on a Qantas aeroplane yesterday and was told there were cookies. It might seem petty and ridiculous, but I said, 'What's that?' You get my point: they were biscuits. You may say that it doesn't matter, that it's silly and irrelevant, but I don't think it is. How do you explain that, when Australia was two weeks away from being invaded, our Army was in the Libyan desert—what the hell was it doing in the Libyan desert?—or protecting a port that had no ships in it? It was because we were doing what we were told by the big boys overseas. We were not acting in the Australian interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know of any other country on earth, except New Zealand, that has a foreign monarch on its coins. The only two countries on earth that have no support levels for agriculture are Australia and New Zealand, and the only one that reduced dramatically was Canada. You can't look at that and not see the colonial spot marks; they're flashing neon lights. What other country in the world intends, by 2030, to get all of its electricity from China? What's wrong here? All of our petrol comes from overseas. It doesn't have to. It should all be Australian. But it's not. No matter where you look, you can see the signs that this is a country that really hasn't grown up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should Ralph Honner be on our coins? Ralph Honner was a man whose battalion, the 39th, saved Australia from invasion at enormous cost to themselves, with 780 going up the Kokoda and only 128 at roll call 2½ months later. Should he be on the coins, or should this person who lives in England be on the coins? Take a little bit of countenance here; he is on our coin as our monarch. Well, I don't want to be told what to do by some person who got there by hereditary means. I constantly quote Diana's brother on how that particular family got on the throne, but I haven't got time to go there today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to see Tubba Tre on our coins. He was the great leader of the Kalkadoons, who held the British intruders at bay for over 20 years. Should he be on our coins? He was a man who fought to stop intrusion into his country. Should Ralph Honner be on our coins? Or should it be some little fella from England who, as far as I can make out, has never worked in his life, never had a job in his life, never done anything to recommend himself for the position?</span>

We have in our constitution that we should swear our allegiance to a foreign monarch. Those of you who read history books will know—and I don't want to get carried away with myself, but I did have a moderately bestselling history of Australia!—that you really should have democracy. It's really wonderful that the Americans start off their constitution the way they do— <span style="font-style:italic;">(T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes important amendments to the Migration Act that complement and reinforce amendments passed by the parliament on 18 November 2023. On 8 November, in the case of NZYQ and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the High Court determined that NZYQ's detention was unlawful 'by reason of there having been and continuing to be no real prospect of the removal of the plaintiff from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future.' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The High Court's decision has significant implications for the safety of vulnerable people in the community and the mechanisms by which the government can provide for their protection. Let me be clear. The Australian government made preparations ahead of the High Court ruling. State and territory police counterparts were briefed on the potential implications of this case prior to the decision being handed down, because community safety has always been front of mind in our approach to this case. Following the 8 November ruling, all released individuals have been subject to appropriate stringent visa conditions, including regular reporting obligations. The Australian Federal Police and the Australian Border Force continue to work together with state and territory authorities and law enforcement to support community safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after the court decision, on 16 November 2023 the parliament in response passed amendments to the act and migration regulations to further support an enduring and robust framework for the management of this cohort in the community. While the legislation passed on 16 November provides a strong initial response to the decision, the government is continuing to work through the implications of the High Court's judgement. The legislative amendments proposed today reinforce those initial amendments by taking the next necessary steps towards ensuring the protection of the Australian community, and we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to protect the Australian community. It is possible, as we continue to work through the implications of this decision, that further legislation may be required to ensure the community is further protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government remains committed to reinforcing Australian laws to support the appropriate and proportionate management of the affected cohort of people while their immigration status is being resolved, and therefore the government will continue to review these arrangements and develop any further amendments as required, including when we have the High Court's reasons for its decision. I believe that the Australian community would rightly expect this of us. Community safety remains the first priority of the Australian government, and the amendments proposed today further strengthen the legislative framework available to manage this cohort, pending their removal from Australia, which we will continue to pursue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this legislation provides further clarity about the government's expectations with regard to the conduct and the behaviour of this cohort, with a particular focus on those with a history of offences in relation to the most vulnerable in our community, including minors and victims. This bill also proposes measures to strengthen the authority for the appropriate collection and use of information gathered by monitoring devices. These amendments reinforce the critical collaboration between Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies, specifically in regard to effective information sharing to ensure that the behaviour of noncitizens in our community complies with our expectations of visitors to our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is putting the needs of victims and their families, of minors and of vulnerable people first. These amendments are in line with community expectations, and they are the right thing to do. Under these laws, those who have been convicted of an offence that involves a minor or another vulnerable person must not perform any work or participate in any regular organised activity involving more than incidental contact with another person who is a minor or another vulnerable person, or go within 200 metres of a school, childcare centre or day care centre. The laws also stipulate that those previously convicted of an offence involving violence or sexual assault must not contact the victim of that offence or any member of that victim's family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sentences provided for in the bill reflect the seriousness of the offending and the government's steadfast commitment to protecting the wellbeing of the most vulnerable members of Australian society. Strong criminal offences are the most effective response to breaches of these visa conditions for the NZYQ affected cohort. This is because, by reason of the High Court decision, the normal consequences of breaching visa conditions do not apply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of the government is clear. Certain behaviours are unacceptable, and there are strong, proportionate, and immediate consequences for the breach of these visa conditions. Charges brought as a result of these new offences will be subject to existing criminal proceedings and judicial determination, and the courts will consider individual circumstances when determining the appropriate sentence. The evidentiary burden for establishing a reasonable defence for failure to comply with the conditions will sit with the noncitizen. The standard defences available in the Criminal Code will also apply. Again I would like to stress that these changes are reasonable, necessary and proportionate to the government's objectives of supporting the safety of the community, particularly the most vulnerable. The Australian community expects, and the Australian government affirms, that these penalties should reflect the seriousness of a breach of conditions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed today will also strengthen the authority for the collection and use of information gathered by electronic monitoring devices. This includes the ability to fit, operate and monitor electronic monitoring devices and a list of purposes for which an authorised officer may collect, use and appropriately disclose information gained from these devices. This includes monitoring the visa holder's compliance with the conditions of their visa and responding rapidly to any indications of non-compliance. The purposes of these conditions are to deter the individual from committing further offences whilst holding the removal-pending visa. This supports ongoing monitoring, which will help keep the community safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned previously, the government will continue to pursue the removal of these people from Australia at the first possible opportunity. The utilisation of electronic monitoring devices will therefore also enable the government to locate the visa holder to facilitate their removal from Australia as soon as a real prospect of removal becomes apparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Acknowledging our obligations to privacy under Australian law, appropriate protocols and processes will be implemented to ensure the information derived from these devices is protected exclusively within the bounds of the purpose for which it is being shared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are reasonable and necessary and will be further supported by a number of amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994 to make our laws more durable by getting ahead of any potential future challenges. We're making strict laws stricter, strong laws stronger, tough laws tougher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these laws we are ensuring the safety of the Australian community. We will continue to ensure the cohort of individuals released from immigration detention as a result of the High Court decision are managed appropriately under the relevant legal frameworks. There is no greater priority for this government than the safety of Australians. This bill is a demonstration of that. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  I'm very glad to make some remarks on the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill 2023, because economic inclusion is a vital part of how Australia ought to work. There's no point having a strong economy, a growth economy, a productive economy, if it's benefits are not shared, and economic inclusion is a big part of that. We've seen many instances in the past where unfortunately that hasn't been the case. There have been some sectors of the community that haven't been able to benefit from the Australian economy through a period of remarkable growth. We've obviously had 28 years of non-recessionary growth—something that many other countries could only dream of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were though, during that period, times when the benefits of that growth weren't evenly shared and you also had a growth in inequality. Some of the areas where we haven't achieved the kind of economic inclusion that we would like include are between men and women in Australia and certainly between First Nations Australians and non-Indigenous Australians. There is the issue of intergenerational equity that needs to be considered. We have circumstances where, as history moves on, parts of the community have done well, whether that's in asset and/or income terms, and others have been left behind. Making sure that we can change our system and settings with a view to increasing economic inclusion should be a priority for all of us, all of the time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I'm thrilled that our strong community campaign has saved the $20 million in funding secured by the former Liberal government for the Maroondah Highway and Killara Road upgrade in Coldstream. After a long 200 days since the Albanese Labor government put the project on the chopping block, it's pleasing that the federal Liberal funding to fix this intersection will remain in the Yarra Valley. Thank you to the 1,000-plus people who signed my petition, the hundreds who attended community meetings and every member of our community who advocated to the federal government on this important project. The former Liberal government secured the funds to upgrade this dangerous intersection in 2019. After nearly five years of inaction by the Victorian state Labor government and this drawn-out review, it's time they got on with the job and fixed the intersection.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also time for Anthony Albanese to reinstate the $100 million that he cut to seal Yarra Ranges' dirt roads. My community knows that the Prime Minister has the wrong priorities. He's cut funding that would seal over 450 dirt roads in the Yarra Ranges—a project that was being delivered on time and on budget and a project that he supported and committed funding to when in opposition. Now is the time to end the days of dust, potholes and mud, and I'll keep calling on the Albanese Labor government to seal these roads and work with our community to make sure that they are safe. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Last Tuesday a bushfire in Aubin Grove in the south-east of my electorate jumped the Kwinana Freeway, driven by a scorching easterly wind. Within minutes, the pall of smoke, ash and raining embers became a serious threat to three local schools. Fortunately, the response of those schools and the courageous work of fire and emergency services ensured no-one was harmed and there was minimal property damage.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was grateful on Friday to speak with the principals of Hammond Park Primary School, Hammond Park Catholic Primary School and Hammond Park Secondary College. All three principals—Dane Franklin, Andrew Colley and Joanne Willesee—did a fantastic job leading their teachers and staff, engaging with parents and carers and guiding their students to safety in frightening and fast-changing circumstances. When I rang Jo Willesee, she had to call me back because there was fresh smoke coming from the fire ground. Andrew Colley said he'd benefited from previous experience of bushfire-prone areas like Kelmscott and Boyup Brook and was glad for the support from Emmanuel Catholic College next door. Each of these calm, professional school leaders noted that, even with the best preparation, it was confronting to deal with the pressing smoke and heat of an imminent fire and that some kids inevitably experienced panic and distress. I want to pay tribute to those school leaders and their school communities for staying calm and collected and to DFES and the professional and volunteer firefighters who responded to the emergency in those circumstances so well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  In 18 months, Labor have driven our economy into the ground. They've failed to tame inflation, they've weakened the jobs market, and they've cut essential services, all while chasing ideological fantasies like the Voice. Labor promised we'd pay $275 less on our power bills. On average, Australian families are paying over 18 per cent more on electricity. They're forking out an additional $1,000 every single fortnight to pay their mortgage. They're paying 8.2 per cent more on food, 10 per cent more on rent and 17 per cent more on insurance. At the same time, housing sales, starts and approvals are the worst on record. The government are welcoming 1.5 million migrants under their 'big Australia' pipedream while cutting 50 road and rail projects, three of which are in my electorate of Fisher, from the pipeline. Instead of delivering on the infrastructure, opportunities and essential services that Australians deserve, Labor are doubling down on their radical and reckless agenda, and Australian families are paying the price. This Prime Minister has stopped the economy and restarted the boats. But Australians are starting to wake up to this Prime Minister and this government's appalling track record in only 18 months, and that is now showing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  During COVID-19, governments had a huge impact on the lives of all Australians and exercised unprecedented control over our day-to-day activities. Many in my community are still feeling the effects of the pandemic very deeply, whether it be concerning their health, mental wellbeing or economic circumstances or whether they lost loved ones. I, therefore, welcomed the government's inquiry into Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I am deeply disappointed that the unilateral decisions made by state and territory governments—which included border and school closures, lockdowns and mask mandates—are excluded from the scope of the inquiry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This disappointment is also shared by my community. We had hundreds of responses to a poll conducted in Wentworth, where 85 per cent of constituents said the inquiry should include the decisions of state governments and around 90 per cent said state and territory leaders should be required to give evidence. Many also shared that they felt the inquiry process had become politicised with this omission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we truly wish to learn from our experience during COVID-19 and ensure Australia's preparedness should another pandemic occur, these key aspects of Australia's response must also be evaluated publicly. There's still time to make this change. With the final report not due until September 2024, it's crucial the government expand its terms of reference and ensure the leaders of state and territories appear before the inquiry. This is too important to politicise. This inquiry must— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Saturday marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the beginning of 16 days of action. As we know too well, too many women and children in Australia face violence in their own homes and communities. One in three women have experienced gender based violence, and we know that so many women this year have, tragically, lost their lives. There is a strong disconnect between the recognition of domestic violence as a problem in Australia, which 91 per cent of Australians believe, and the recognition that it's a problem in our own areas, which only 47 per cent of people believe. Domestic violence can happen to anyone of any age, cultural background, education or income level and in any place around our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the campaign for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is: 'UNiTE! Invest to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls.' This year's campaign calls on citizens to share the actions they are taking to create a world free from violence towards women and is calling on governments to share how they are investing in violence prevention. I am incredibly proud to be part of a government committed to ending violence against women and their children; I want to commend the leadership of the Minister for Social Services in this, as well as our Prime Minister. This year is the first year of the new National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. We are working with the states and territories to create tangible change, including through ambitious targets. We must all unite together to end violence against women.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Today I will read a speech by Ava Minovski, a 16-year-old resident in my electorate of Goldstein who submitted this speech as part of the Raise Our Voice Australia campaign. Ava writes:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Parliament is a diverse and ever-evolving landscape; it is a symbol of our Nation's democratic values.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is essential that as we look towards our future, our Parliamentarians continue to respect the framework that our democracy has provided for more than 120 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mahatma Gandhi once said, 'the future depends on what we do in the present'. With this in mind, continuing to uphold our parliamentary structure with the principles of our democracy will underpin the future stability and success of our Nation. We must ensure any future challenges our great Country meets are addressed with the strong, reliable, and resilient foundations of our Constitution. We should, as a Nation work to elevate our democratic standing on the international stage, in order to continue to be the democracy others aspire to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">While I cannot imagine changes to make Australia better for future generations, I can believe that if we continue to be guided by innovation and knowledge through the voices of our democratically elected representatives, the safety, security, and success of our Nation will endure.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Over the past week, fire has ravaged through my electorate of Pearce in Western Australia, resulting in 1,870 hectares burnt, 18 homes lost, many homes damaged and numerous vehicles lost, and we are still counting. Infrastructure, including power poles and water assets, has been damaged. Business is impacted, including the local strawberry grower, who has lost an entire crop. My thanks go to the emergency services personnel and our amazing local volunteer bushfire brigades—Wanneroo Central Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade, Wanneroo Volunteer Fire Support Brigade, Quinns Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade and Two Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade—all of whom worked tirelessly to keep our community safe and did such an incredible job in saving homes and properties in extremely challenging conditions. I also recognise the many volunteers in our local community, who are inspirational. Consistently I see people step up to help others, whether it be a neighbour or a stranger, opening their hearts and homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot begin to imagine the anguish and stress experienced by residents who have lost their properties, and my heart goes out to them. The federal, state and local governments have ensured that assistance is available for those impacted as quickly as possible. The bushfire proved how fast and far a fire can travel and that living in suburbia does not mean you are immune from fire risk. Again, I give my heartfelt thanks to our incredible firies and to our community that have shown their strength in times of adversity by their generosity and love for one another.</span>

I thank my fellow co-conveners, the honourable member for Robertson and the honourable member for Mackellar, for their assistance in establishing this group. Over one million Australians suffer from an autoimmune disease. These are some of the most chronic health conditions faced by Australians. Most of us in this place will know someone who suffers from one of these debilitating diseases, whether it be inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, Hashimoto's disease, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main role of the immune system is to protect the body from harm caused by bacteria, moulds and viruses. In autoimmune diseases, for reasons we still do not understand, the immune system attacks the body's own cells, tissues and organs, resulting in inflammation and damage. We are still in the Dark Ages when it comes to understanding and treating autoimmune diseases, let alone preventing them. Whilst inflammation, environmental toxins and stress appear to play a role in autoimmune diseases, the precise triggers remain unknown, and there are currently no cures. My journey with autoimmune disease started 20 years ago, when I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. It is hoped that the Parliamentary Friends of Autoimmune Diseases will raise awareness and start some serious research into autoimmune diseases.</span>

The awards recognise exemplary work of staff across the group, with a special focus on those who go above and beyond for the people they care for. Recognition was also given to long-term staff members who had been with the group for more than 35 years. One employee in particular was retiring after 48 years of service, which is a testament to the dedication that Whiddon has come to exemplify over the 70 years it has been a part of our community.</span>

Whilst there have been a number of changes over the years, the group now provides both residential and home care in New South Wales in over 17 sites. This is all with a view to ensuring that residents are well looked after and have many opportunities to grow old gracefully and are well supported.</span>

I thank Mr Chris Mamarelis, CEO of Whiddon, and his team for the wonderful event and the great work that they do for our older residents every single day in our part of the world.</span>

Selina continues her grandmother Aunty Agnes Shea's strong legacy of influencing and driving change with her efforts.</span>

As a founding member of the Yerrabi Yurwang Child and Family Aboriginal Corporation, she helps improve outcomes for Aboriginal families and children, especially those in out-of-home care. Selina advocates for Indigenous people within the justice system as a member of the ACT victims of crime and justice committee and has held roles to improve all children's educational outcomes in the Catholic school system. A kinship carer, Selina was awarded the Barnardos 2017 ACT Mother of the Year award. Her dedication and compassion for our community confirms her credentials as the 2024 ACT Local Hero. Selina intends to use her new platform to progress true reconciliation so that First Nations Australians can get the change they all need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise to condemn agriculture minister Murray Watt for his refusal to release the much-anticipated report of the independent panel on the phase-out of live sheep export by sea. The live export ban was actually announced by the activist organisation Australian Alliance for Animals during the 2022 election campaign, and this government still proudly supports it, despite the dire economic consequences shared with the panel during stakeholder consultations earlier this year. Last week, the government refused three FOI requests begging for the release of this 230-page document.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WA farmers, transporters, stock agents and exporters remain in limbo. Industry confidence has plummeted, and sheep prices have fallen to record lows. It is now cheaper to shoot sheep than to transport them to market, yet the PM recently proclaimed in question time that the industry can't react to something that hasn't happened yet.  This government is a disgrace. Its departments are failing to advise on the damage this phase-out will cause to our domestic agricultural industries and our international trade reputation. In Senate estimates, ABARES admitted they had not done any modelling on the economic impacts of the phase-out and nor had they spoken to any growers, processors or exporters, and DFAT admitted they had not investigated the wider trade implications of the loss of this $85 million industry. I invite the PM and Minister Watt to come to WA, look my constituents in the eyes and explain why Green preferences are more important than their livelihoods.</span>

Our community rely on it to get them to work or school and home to their loved ones. During the federal election, as the Labor candidate for Hawke, I committed that an Albanese government would kickstart the Western Freeway upgrade with the necessary business case works.

Environmental and technical surveys are being conducted with workers on the ground. Our project is a comprehensive business case to upgrade the freeway between Melton and Caroline Springs, looking at additional lanes, new interchanges and overpasses, lighting upgrades and more. It's a project that will get people home to their families quicker and safer and will create a lasting legacy for our community. Community consultation is currently underway. Have your say before it closes on Sunday 10 December.</span>

I also keep working closely with the state member for Melton, Steve McGhie, and our community to make sure that we secure this important upgrade. I say again that this is the opportunity for our community to ensure that we have the infrastructure required in our growing suburbs well into the future to get people to work and home safely to their loved ones.</span>

It's indicative of how hopeless this Labor government is at managing the Australian economy, looking after taxpayers' money and, indeed, the simple things like being able to count, given it took 200 days to complete a 90-day review.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flinders lost more infrastructure funding than any other Victorian electorate, and this was not because of any mistake made by my constituents. They had advocated for an overpass at the intersection of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway and Jetty Road for decades. In 2019, the coalition government gave $75 million to start work on an overpass and sound barriers, making it safe for the thousands of cars that go through this intersection every day and the millions who go through it over summer. A fraction of the money has been spent on minor works to make it safe for kids to cross the road on the way to school, but it is nowhere near enough.</span>

This framework would shape the way that TV applications and/or content are presented to Australians and ensure that local TV services can be easily found on connected devices so they can continue to contribute to Australian public and cultural life. It's important to me, as co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Children's Storytelling, and to many others that Australian children are presented with Australian children's content. We aren't the only ones who are loving Australian content. <span style="font-style:italic;">Barrumbi K</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ids</span> has just been awarded the top prize at the largest annual festival of children's screen content in the whole world, the 40th Chicago International Children's Film Festival. <span style="font-style:italic;">Barrumbi Kids</span>—produced by Danielle MacLean of the Darwin based production company Tamarind Tree Pictures, by Monica O'Brien of Ambience Entertainment and by independent producer Julia Morris—is based on the popular book series by Territory author Leonie Norrington and has premiered on NITV and Netflix. Massive congratulations to the whole <span style="font-style:italic;">Barrumbi Kids</span> creative team, cast and crew. This is what Australian creatives are capable of, so let's give them a fighting chance.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Last week I had the pleasure of attending a think tank with the University of the Sunshine Coast, who have a campus at Caboolture in my electorate of Longman. One of the issues they raised was that university placements are going backwards in this country. A great discussion ensued and I relayed some of my thoughts, which I'd developed from listening to my constituents and from knowledge gained in my position as deputy chair of the Employment, Education and Training Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two emerging factors that I've discovered, and they are these. The first is that more and more young people are taking up trades or vocations that don't require a university degree, as this generation seems to understand that you don't need to have a university degree to have a successful and fulfilling life, which is good news for those who are not wired for university education. The second factor is that more and more parents are sharing with me the fact that they are pulling their children out of state schools, home-schooling them or putting them into independent schools and discouraging them from taking up university degrees, as they don't like the increased focus on social issues. They simply want their children educated, not indoctrinated—their words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to universities out there: you have an opportunity to increase your enrolments by meeting the market expectations, and the ball is in your court. To increase enrolments, please, just appeal to a broader market.</span>

Murray Watt, when I was joined by the South Australian agriculture minister, the Hon. Clare Scriven, and board members of the Adelaide produce market for the launch of a $50 million biosecurity facility that is to be built at the Adelaide produce market next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new facility will help secure and grow South Australia's $1.4 billion horticultural sector. It will save time and cost for South Australian growers, who currently have to send their produce to Brisbane or Melbourne for processing. It is expected to unlock $119 million in fresh produce exports over the next five years, and it will also create 172 direct and indirect jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it will greatly assist in managing and controlling fruit fly outbreaks, which cost the economy millions of dollars each year and certainly, over recent years, have been detrimental to South Australian growers. Indeed, there are outbreaks right now that are being managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the new facility will help maintain our growers' clean, green image and consumer confidence in South Australian produce. The Albanese government's $10 million investment in the new public privately funded biosecurity facility is a welcome investment in South Australia's horticultural sector.</span>

The stupa is the most sacred Buddhist building. It is where the Buddha's relics are enshrined. The stupa being built in Mount Evelyn at the Mahamevnawa Buddhist monastery is the very first stupa in Australia, which they're very excited about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much thank Ravi Hewavisse and head Thero Bodhi Damma for their very kind invitation. I also acknowledge the hard work and warmth of caretaker Peter Cameron and all the great work of the Buddhist monks, who were very excited about this stone laying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary focus there is meditation. Over 615,000 people practise Buddhism in Australia. It's a beautiful religion. The Buddhist monastery in Mount Evelyn sees Sri Lankan, Thai and Australian devotees frequent the temple for worship. Buddhist teachings are very relevant to modern life. The five precepts of Buddhism hold teachings for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was great to see the closed-circuit TV cameras and the security gates in operation. They makes the devotees feel so much safer. I'm very proud to have secured the funding this is making the monks safer where they reside overnight.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  My community of Boothby has welcomed the recent opening of the urgent care clinic at Marion Domain Medical and Dental Centre. Situated near Flinders Medical Centre, this service provides a bulk-billing alternative for people with urgent but not life-threatening conditions so they can get seen faster and more appropriately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flinders Medical Centre is the major tertiary hospital south of Adelaide. It provides services to people in Boothby, Kingston and Mayo, which can make for a really hectic emergency department unless your condition is life-threatening. The urgent care clinic means people can be seen faster. But, importantly, it frees up emergency department doctors and nurses to focus on the life-threatening issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jess, the state manager for ForHealth, the parent body of Marion Domain, told me that they have six urgent care clinics open interstate and that in the first six months they saw 40,000 people. That's 40,000 fewer people in emergency departments and ambulance queues, and that's a great outcome. Urgent care clinics are a great initiative. They speed up our health system and cut down on ambulance ramping and on the long waits in emergency departments.</span>

Last week the Albanese government did announce a very significant step to ensure that our transition to renewable energy is more orderly and faster, and that's necessary for a number of reasons. Of course we all know that renewable energy is very good for emissions, but this is also a vital step to ensure the reliability of our energy system. After a decade in which four gigawatts of dispatchable power left the grid and only one gigawatt came on, we knew that we had to act to ensure that new energy is introduced to the system before old energy leaves. The previous government had an approach of leaving it until after coal-fired power stations closed. We take the approach of getting the investment on ahead of those changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important for reliability because the average age of Australia's coal-fired fleet is 33 years. Inevitably, after many decades of service, coal-fired power stations increasingly encounter issues. In fact, today, as we speak, there are nine coal-fired power stations across Australia with one or more units out of action. That equates to about 3.8 gigawatts of power we do not currently have access to. If we'd had a better regime in place to get more investment on earlier, we wouldn't be so reliant on that increasingly unreliable source of energy. Now, this is very important for Australian industry. It's important for Australian households. That's why the announcement last week has been so broadly welcomed not just by climate groups, not just by energy groups but by the Australian Industry Group, by the Energy Users Association of Australia and by the Australian Aluminium Council, who referred to this announcement as being crucial for Australia's energy future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As important as last week's announcement was, it was not, of course, the only important announcement. In fact, last year, working very closely together, the minister for resources, minister for industry, the Treasurer and I announced the gas code, which is necessary. Now, there has been a disallowance moved in the Senate by the Greens. They say they don't like gas. They want to rip up the only regulation of gas. This code requires new gas supply to be supplied to Australia. If they succeed in ripping up the gas code, the gas can still be extracted and sent overseas. That's the big genius move by the Greens party. We don't know the views of the opposition. They haven't declared their view. It's up for a vote in a few hours. But we know they like a gas led recovery. The Greens also apparently support a gas led recovery—just not one that's in Australia.</span>

It has moderated since then, but we do need it to moderate further, and we need it to moderate faster. What has been clear around the world and what we expect here is that inflation doesn't always moderate in a straight line. It remains to be seen whether or not we will see that in the more volatile monthly figures later in the week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But cost-of-living pressures are the biggest concern around the kitchen tables of this country, and they are the biggest focus of the cabinet table here in Canberra as well. We understand Australians are doing it tough, and that's why the government is rolling out billions of dollars in assistance for people under pressure—electricity bill relief, cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, increased rent assistance, increased income support, more bulk-billing, expanding PPL, fee-free TAFE, building more affordable homes, getting wages moving again. We're pleased to see a second consecutive quarter of real wages growth.</span>

                  </a>  Our cost-of-living plan is carefully designed and calibrated and targeted to take some of the edge off inflation rather than add to it. And the ABS said that our policies took half a percentage point off inflation in the most recent data. Without our energy plan, electricity would have gone up 18.6 per cent, not 4.2 per cent. Without our rent assistance, rent would have gone up 2½ per cent, not 2.2. Without our childcare policies, fees would have gone up 6.7 per cent, not down by 13.2 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about the hurdles, and it's worth reminding the House that when those opposite voted against our cost-of-living help they voted for higher inflation and they voted for lower wages. If they had their way, inflation would be higher and wages would be lower, and that's why we inherited real wages falling 3.4 per cent. Honourable members should not forget this when they cry crocodile tears over the cost of living. Their nasty negativity is no substitute for economic credibility.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our responsible economic management is helping in the fight against inflation. The IMF said that when they handed down their report card. Fitch said that when they reaffirmed the AAA. The RBA governor said that when she was asked at estimates.</span>

I think in my last answer I made our views on inflation and cost-of-living help pretty clear. Inflation is moderating in our economy, not as fast or as far as we would like but it's moderating from the high-quarterly peak that we inherited. The Reserve Bank governor, as is appropriate, has made some comments about that in recent weeks, as have I. Our focus as a government is on rolling out those 10 different types of cost-of-living relief that I went through in some detail a moment ago.</span>

There are three vital ways that you can tackle cost of living: you can get costs down for families, you can get wages up for workers but you can also get the budget onto a stronger foundation, and we're doing all three. Our responsible budget management means that we can invest in cheaper medicines, affordable housing, energy bill relief, higher wages, cheaper child care, while those opposite said no to all of the above.</span>

The truth is that you only need your Medicare card, not your credit card—unlike his Leader of the Opposition, who wanted to impose a cost on every person who ever saw a doctor, with a co-payment.

He tried to abolish bulk-billing with a GP tax. He wanted to increase the price of medicines with a medicine tax and wanted to whack every single patient with a hospital tax when they turned up, as well. No wonder he was voted Australia's worst ever health minister. What we're doing is working to strengthen Medicare as part of our plan for strengthening Australia and working for Australia.</span>

The fact is that unemployment is at historic lows: 3.7 per cent. The participation rate is at a record high. The gender pay gap is at a record low, but women's workforce participation is at a record high. Business investment is up, but the number of days lost to industrial disputes is down. Over 620,000 jobs have been created, more than under any first-term government in Australia's history and we're only halfway through. We've seen two consecutive quarters of real wage growth, even though those opposite, when they were in government, argued that low wage growth was a key feature of their economic architecture. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to inflation, we know that inflation peaked in the March 2022 quarter. What is it about March 2022? It was the last quarter that they were in government. It was in their last quarter that it peaked. But, as well as that—and we recognise that fiscal policy has an impact on inflation—under us came the first budget surplus in 15 years. That's something unrecognisable for those opposite, who left a $78 billion deficit. We've got a $22 billion surplus.</span>

We're doing this because it matters. We're doing this—and this is really important—because it's not talking tough that keeps Australians safe; it's strong laws and a relentless focus on compliance—two things that members opposite know very little about.</span>

                  </a>  That's why the New South Wales Liberal government, when they introduced their equivalent scheme, kept the cost commercial in confidence. That's the way it works in Western Australia. We hear from the member for Hume. It's a concept he might be familiar with because, when he announced the UNGI scheme, underwriting new generation investments—which would have been better called 'unfortunately, no generation involved'; actually there was not one watt—he said, when he was asked, 'These discussions are commercial in confidence, and I'm not going to go into the details of them here and now.' </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:33</span>):  I thank the member for his question. The member is correct; we are introducing legislation that will enable Australian citizenship to be stripped from individuals who represent a serious danger to our country. The way these laws are framed is that they articulate conduct that may occur which is actually so offensive to the values of community safety and to the values of Australian citizenship that the individual at the heart of the matter themselves repudiate the fact that they are Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, this legislation is very important, and the House would be aware that there is a long and, frankly, highly politicised history of this matter being dealt with by the parliament. In fact, those opposite had two completely failed attempts to deliver laws that affected this exact outcome—one in 2015 and one in 2019. I'd remind the parliament that the laws that were introduced in 2015 were actually so unworkable that the government that introduced them repealed them completely four years later. The second go, which the opposition leader led, didn't do much better. It was ruled unconstitutional over the past 18 months. So we had two citizenship laws introduced in 2019, and both of them were ruled unconstitutional by the High Court in the last 18 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked if the bill that we're introducing is the only thing we are doing to keep Australians safe, and of course that's not the case, not by a long shot. The primary purpose of our government is to ensure the safety of Australians. We came to office with an enormous set of issues facing us—in particular, in the home affairs department. One of those was the broken migration system that I've spoken to the House about before. We had a system which a report by Christine Nixon, a former police commissioner in Victoria, told us was enabling sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Thanks to the Nixon report, we know just how much wrongdoing actually occurred under the Leader of the Opposition when he was running this portfolio. What we saw was that many of the individuals that were engaged in the most egregious infringements on human rights and safety of people in our country came into the country under the Leader of the Opposition's watch. Instead of dealing with what were very serious issues, not just highlighted by the Nixon review but in fact highlighted over a series of reports that spanned almost the entire life of the former government, the Leader of the Opposition talked a big game, but, when it came down to it, he cut funding for immigration compliance and made sure that our borders were not secure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is taking a very different and deliberate approach. If there is one thing that we can take from the citizenship matter that will be before the parliament this week, it is this: laws that don't work don't make us any safer. They actually make us more dangerous. What we are doing on this side of the House is doing the hard work in making sure that our laws actually are constitutional in order to protect our country. That's what we're here for.</span>

We continue to approve and support renewable energy projects, because we know the biggest difference we can make to the environment for this country and for our planet is to move effectively to zero net emissions. I'm very proud of the fact that this government has a serious energy program, in contrast to those opposite, who had two dozen different energy programs and didn't deliver a single one of them. We will continue to work with renewable energy proponents, with local communities, to make sure we get this right so that we can transition to a renewable energy economy while protecting our environment at the same time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  I thank the terrific member for Canberra for her question. She has been such a strong advocate for better and cheaper health care in her seat here in the ACT, and she campaigned so hard on Labor's promise last year to strengthen Medicare and to make medicines cheaper. This government is delivering on her promise: tripling the bulk-billing incentive; rolling out, as the Prime Minister said, a network of 58 Medicare urgent care clinics; and making medicines cheaper. Last year we slashed the maximum amount that pensioners and concession card holders would pay across a given year for all of their medicine needs by a quarter, by 25 per cent. That means this year around two million people on the pension or holding a concession card have paid up to 25 per cent less for their medicines. In just 10 months after we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, there have been almost half a million cheaper scripts issued here in the ACT. Across the nation every single month, Australians are saving around $20 million just because of that one single measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Canberra has also been a really strong advocate for better bulk-billing arrangements. Here in the ACT, we see some of the lowest rates of bulk-billing anywhere in the country. Our government's tripling of the bulk-billing incentive, which took effect on 1 November, is a game changer, to use the language of the College of GPs. It's early days, but we are already seeing this historic investment make a real difference. At the last sitting, a couple of weeks ago, I talked about a clinic in Magnetic Island, in the member for Herbert's electorate. He's not here right now, at question time, but in his electorate there is a clinic that has returned from private billing to bulk-billing because of our measure. Last week, a clinic in Caringbah, in the member for Cook's electorate, reported an increase in bulk-billing rates from September, when about half of patients were bulk-billed at that big clinic, to November, when two-thirds were being bulk-billed—just two months later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this side of the House and for the member for Canberra, that really matters. That really matters because bulk-billing for us, the Labor Party, is the beating heart of Medicare, and that is the big difference in health policy. While Labor tripled the bulk-billing incentive, a record investment, the Leader of the Opposition, when he was health minister, tried to abolish bulk-billing altogether, to make every single Australian pay a fee every single time they visited the doctor. While Labor is making medicines cheaper, the Leader of the Opposition, when he was health minister, tried to make medicines more expensive by jacking up the price of medicines by up to $5 a script. That is the difference between them and us. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

February will mark 10 years since Rosie Batty's son, Luke, was killed by his father. Rosie is in this place today, still advocating for women and children, yet 54 women have been killed so far this year, and children are still being killed by parents once a fortnight. The government's plan to reduce deaths by 25 per cent year on year has failed in 2023. What will you do differently next year to stop women and children from being murdered?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I thank the member for her question and for her genuine commitment, along with that of other members of this House, to eliminate violence against women and children. And I acknowledge Rosie Batty; I'm not sure whether she's in the gallery, but I acknowledge her in the House. She is a great Australian. She took a tragedy and turned it into a motivation to make a difference for others. One life lost to domestic and family violence is one too many. But this year, as with every year, there has been one life lost after another. Recent tragedies have starkly reminded us that family and domestic violence recognises no social, economic or cultural barriers. But while it's indiscriminate, it certainly is not inevitable. We can't keep accepting this violence as inevitable, because it is unacceptable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During 16 Days of Activism I want to reiterate the government's commitment to ending violence against women and children in one generation. We must treat this violence as something we can end and focus all our efforts on doing to, because there's no time to waste. Men in particular have to step up, and our leaders have an opportunity to champion change and create the conditions that prevent violence, abuse, discrimination and harassment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My government is taking immediate and practical action. We have record investment of $2.3 billion in this area—ministers across government working to end family, domestic and sexual violence. We've fixed the escaping-violence payment, reducing the time it takes victims-survivors to access support by 22 days. We have extended funding for states and territories to deliver frontline services, including ones that were due to just end. We've delivered on our commitment of new frontline and community sector workers to support victims-survivors. We've legislated for 10 days of family and domestic violence leave for all employees, including casuals. We've made family law reform a priority to make the family law system simpler and safer for people who are fleeing violence. We have responded to sexual violence in university settings and through respectful-relationships education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a scourge on our society. I thank the member very much for her question, and I note the colour scheme representing the 16 Days campaign that is on. We need 16 Days of Activism, but we also need 365 days a year of action and commitment to rid our society of this scourge.</span>

We continue in that bipartisanship spirit by congratulating the member for her question. Like everybody in this place, we should be dedicated to the elimination of violence against women and children. There are some programs which are working very effectively and a frustration within those organisations, when talking to those advocates, about how to scale it up and how they can get the ear of government to replicate their success across the country. There are some horrific cases, and the human cost—not just to the individual family and loved ones left behind but to society—is quite astounding. We will do everything that is humanly possible to support the work by the government, by the state and territory governments and by NGOs to bring an end to this terrible scourge.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, the policies of the government are making a difference. Yes, people are still doing it tough and more needs to be done, and those opposite are about to get a chance to do more when the final votes happen on the closing loopholes bill. That's exactly the issue that member for Robertson has asked me about, because the member for Robertson has asked about the business consultation. There are different attitudes from different business groups. Effectively, there are some business groups who have individual members who are using these loopholes to underpay people. That's what they're doing. Some of them have significant financial gain to be made by this bill not going forward, and every day it is delayed is a day that is better for them to be able to continue underpaying their workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed today that the ads are back. I noticed the ads back in one of the papers. A while ago, when the ads first started, you could have forgiven the groups that were funding them. They hadn't seen the bill yet, so maybe they didn't know that the ads involved misinformation. Maybe they didn't know that this concept that you would be compelled to pay a brand-new worker the same as your most experienced worker was not going to turn up in the legislation. Now they've seen the legislation; it's there in black and white and it's made no difference to the advertising at all because those organisations want to delay, complain about consultation that initially they were part of and then said can they no longer be involved in confidential conversation, and then they want to talk about something that the issue is not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But contrast to the groups that have engaged. Contrast to the Hotels Association, which engaged professionally. As a result, tomorrow I'll introduce amendments to the casuals provisions. Compare that to Uber, Menulog and DoorDash, which engaged constructively. There will be amendments to the gig provisions specifically making sure that we meet the purposes of the legislation. Compare that to the peak body representing the industrial interests of the resources industry, AREEA—hardly a member of the Labor Party but a professional organisation that has represented its members. There will be amendments as a result. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We respect the outcome that was made on 14 October. Prior to 14 October, I stood at this dispatch box, and they were trying to say that what people were voting on was treaty. They might recall that. I indicated at this dispatch box that that wasn't what people were voting on and that, indeed, treaty negotiations are underway at state level, not at federal level. There are no treaty negotiations underway by the federal government. Those negotiations are at different points in Victoria and in Queensland, where the Queensland LNP said that they supported it. They said that they supported it and they voted for the legislation. They voted for it before they were against it.</span>

Our government places extremely high value on the professionalism and integrity of the Australian Public Service. There was extensive media reporting undertaken in late September this year which raised a number of questions about the conduct of the secretary of my department at the time, Mr Pezzullo. We regard these matters as very serious, and they required a serious investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament would be aware that, as soon as I became aware of these allegations, I referred the matter to the Australian Public Service Commissioner. The Australian Public Service Commissioner then conducted a lengthy, proper investigation of the conduct. The report into that matter has been finalised and handed to the Prime Minister. The report found multiple breaches of the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct by Mr Pezzullo. Ms Briggs, who ran the inquiry, determined that Mr Pezzullo breached the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct on at least 14 occasions in relation to five overarching allegations, those allegations being that Mr Pezzullo used his duty, power, status or authority to seek to gain benefit or advantage for himself, that he engaged in gossip and disrespectful critique of ministers and public servants, that he failed to maintain confidentiality of sensitive government information, that he failed to act apolitically in his employment and that he failed to disclose a conflict of interest. Based on those findings, and at the recommendation of Ms Briggs, Mr Pezzullo's appointment as the secretary of my department has been terminated.</span>

We have profound respect for the frank and fearless advice that the Australian Public Service has a great history of providing to Australian governments. We value proper process. We value the integrity of the Australian Public Service; indeed, we insist on it.</span>

With respect, the member for Goldstein's question was the first to address domestic and family violence in this place. Many talk about keeping communities safe, but we are failing women and children. A woman a week and a child every two weeks are killed and yet we talk of keeping communities safe. Both sides of parliament came together to pass urgent legislation following the High Court decision. Where is the urgency, the national emergency, when it comes to women and children? With respect, 10 years is not good enough.</span>

We announced the most significant expansion, and we put the money in the budget. Now there are people working to protect women and children from domestic violence because of that.</span>

I'm determined to make sure that my government, while we are in office, make a difference each and every day and at each and every opportunity that we have had around the cabinet table, led by, it must be said, the Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher. Minister Amanda Rishworth and Minister Bill Shorten have particular responsibilities in these areas but are particularly led by Katy Gallagher. If there has been a stronger advocate for women ever elected to either chamber in this place, I have not seen them. So we will continue to do what we can, and I would hope that we do so, reflected by the Leader of the Opposition's last comments in response to the question that I received, in a bipartisan way. I accept, for example, that the Leader of the Opposition took some measures, when he was minister, particularly aimed at children and those issues. These issues certainly should remain bipartisan. I assure the member for Warringah that I will continue to be a strong advocate, but I'm very proud of what my government has done. Has it been perfect? No, because these issues aren't perfect. They take time.</span>

Men are in a position to make a difference with their peers. This needs to be not just a government response—this needs to be a whole-of-society response. And that is what I am committed to as a matter of urgency.</span>

I want to say to the member for Warringah: I'm sure that her sentiment is heartfelt but this is not an issue for pointscoring or political difference. The Australian public should hear that there is no difference between either side—anybody in this chamber—in relation to this most serious issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every government, including this government, has dedicated themselves to doing its best to reduce violence through funding, through programs, through innovation, and the support that the Prime Minister expects from all of us is forthcoming—will be forthcoming, Prime Minister. I don't believe it's a fair critique of the government to say that they haven't done enough or that they're not doing enough or that they don't have the intention to act properly in this space. I don't think that's the view of the Prime Minister at all, and I think it mischaracterises the approach of the government, and the approach of the opposition will be to support it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister rightly points out, the establishment of Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation was supported on a bipartisan basis, and it saved, literally, thousands of children. It supported women in domestic violence situations where children were being sexually offended against. The strongest message that we can send from this chamber to the Australian public is that we stand united to condemn it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister rightly points out, all of us should have conversations, and regular conversations, with our sons, with our nephews, with others that we influence. And we need to call out in the workplace, or anywhere else, the atrocious conversation, demeaning behaviour or conduct that some might seek to pursue. This is not an issue where there is a cigarette paper of difference between the government and the opposition, and nor should there be with the crossbench or with anyone else in this place.</span>

The Labor government recognises and believes in a future made in Australia, but it will take a lot of work to achieve that vision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today a new report was released by Industry Innovation and Science Australia. The report found that we need to scale up our businesses to help rebuild manufacturing. The report also shows that the government has inherited a shrinking middle band of businesses. The proportion of medium-sized businesses in manufacturing has declined by close to 40 per cent in the last 14 years, and that's why the government's taking action to help businesses that want to grow and scale up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's $392 million Industry Growth Program, announced in the budget, has kicked off officially today. As of today, businesses will be able to apply for expert advice on getting their good ideas to market and expanding their companies. Future rounds of the program will also deliver matched grant funding, ranging from $50,000 to $5 million to give businesses the capital they need to grow, and it'll provide a pipeline of medium-sized businesses who can access the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a reference to a decade of neglect, and, boy, have we got a lot to work with there! The Liberals and Nationals came to office looking down their noses at Australian manufacturing. They hounded car manufacturers out of the country. Under their watch, we ended up with some of the lowest manufacturing self-sufficiency in the OECD, and today's report shows a contraction in the number of mid-sized manufacturers. After all that, the coalition scrambled, recognising the grave error of their ways. They announced in October 2020 a $1.5 billion manufacturing grants program, and guess when 85 per cent of those grants were announced: in the weeks leading into the 2022 federal election. The coalition are always there to manufacture a headline but never there to back Australian manufacturing, and this continues today, as they have refused to back the National Reconstruction Fund and energy price relief that would have helped manufacturers.</span>

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government that said EVs would ruin and end the weekend but now supports the manufacture of the charging equipment of the cars they don't want on the roads.

                  </a>  The only people who don't get it are the opposition. They've still got their little fantasy wrapped in an illusion: nuclear energy. The Leader of the National Party, to his credit, on Friday was honest. He came out and said, 'We don't expect nuclear energy in the next decade or so, but we've got till 2050.' I've got news for the Leader of the National Party: we don't have till 2050, because we've got to provide reliability in the energy grid today. I don't think we should wait until 2050. As coal fired power ages and becomes more unreliable, we need more investment today. The Leader of the National Party and his cohort might be happy to leave fixing that until 2050. They spent nine years not fixing it. They might as well spend till 2050 not fixing it.</span>

I note the fact that she's been campaigning for over two years on this important issue. I remember attending a forum in her electorate back in 2021 where she pointed out to me that her constituents have been left to fight on their own against the scammers who are ripping off $3 billion from Australian households and small businesses. She pointed out to me back then that the Morrison government was leaving these people on their own to fight against these criminals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, things have changed. Under this government, we have a comprehensive policy to take the fight to these criminals. It includes an $86 million investment to establish a new National Anti-Scam Centre. We've got the Australian Securities and Investments Commission pulling down fake investment websites. Over 2,500 fake investment websites have been pulled down because of that investment. With the great work of the Minister for Communications, we've got the Australian Communications and Media Authority putting in place a new SMS ID registry to block those annoying SMSs that are becoming a major vector for scammers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are early signs that it is working. I'm pleased to inform the House that the first quarterly report of the National Anti-Scam Centre was released today, and it has shown that there has been a 16 per cent decrease in overall scam losses. Investment scams, for the first time, are down by six per cent. Romance scams—there wouldn't be a member in this place who hasn't had a constituent come to them and talk to them about the horror and the heartbreak of a romance scam—are down by 28 per cent over the quarter. This is a great result. In fact, the month of September has seen the lowest monthly loss since October 2021. There is more to come, with new codes of practice to be rolled out over the year ahead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been asked about the stakeholders' response. Well, it's been fantastic. On Friday I stood up with the Australian Banking Association and COBA to support a new package, a banking accord, which will put new measures in place to keep Australians' money safe. It includes confirmation of payee and a range of other measures to help bank customers keep their money safe. It is broadly supported by consumer organisations. But there is one stakeholder who is not yet on board, because in government it could not have been less interested in consumers, and it has been over seven months since it's had a shadow minister responsible for consumer affairs. They are not interested in consumers. They're not interested in taking on the scammers. We are. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

He didn't support increased rental assistance. He didn't support our program for investment, to improve more private rentals. He is opposed to every single housing measure that is put forward by this government. Our housing measures are aimed at getting more Australians into homes. This week we'll be introducing our legislation for the Help to Buy Scheme, which will be a national scheme that will assist more Australians to get into homes. We'll wait and see whether they do what they always do and just say no to that as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I thank the member for Lalor for her question. Last week we announced the expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme, something that was supported by those opposite. They don't seem to realise that. When they write the questions, they don't seem to realise that. In its simplest form, this scheme is designed to make sure that new energy projects are coming online before older energy projects leave. Those opposite presided over four gigawatts leaving the system and one gigawatt coming on. We on this side are making sure that we can deliver more reliable energy to all Australians. It's already working in New South Wales and being piloted in other states. The single joint tender announced last week, with the New South Wales government, will deliver more power into the New South Wales grid than the LNP managed to deliver over the past decade for the whole National Electricity Market. Just bear that in mind. We have delivered more with one pilot scheme in New South Wales. Under the last government, 24 of Australia's 28 coal plants announced their closure dates. But did they put in place anything to replace them? No, they didn't. That is why it was such a dangerous and irresponsible approach. That's why we've stepped in to clean up the mess. This will add around 32 gigawatts of new capacity across the country, equivalent to about half of the current east coast electricity grid. That's why it has been welcomed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  Mr Speaker, I acknowledge your support and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his enthusiastic encouragement of my seeking of this indulgence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the first member for Berowra, the Hon. Tom Hughes, AO, KC, celebrated his 100th birthday. Tom Hughes is one of the handful of people who, having served in this House, have reached such a milestone. Tom's service is synonymous with principled and dignified leadership. During World War II, Tom served in the RAAF and was part of the invasion of Normandy. For his part in the skies, Tom received the French Legion of Honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tom was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1963 as the member for Parkes. His campaign manager was his friend the young John Howard, and they remain friends to this day. When Parkes was abolished, Tom became the first member for Berowra. He also served as Attorney-General in the government of his friend Sir John Gorton. As Attorney, he sought to expand the use of Commonwealth power in the corporations and seabed areas, and he had a clear understanding of the need to keep Australians safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes safety begins at home. On one occasion protesters turned up at Tom's home. They included the future New South Wales minister Ian Macdonald. Tom famously drove them off his lawn with a cricket bat. When John Gorton lost the prime ministership, Tom also left the parliament, but he remained loyal to Gorton to the end. Not since Pericles has there been a more famous or cutting funeral oration than the one Tom delivered at John Gorton's funeral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After politics, Tom returned to the bar. Tom was admitted to the bar in his 20s and he retired from the bar at age 90. At his peak, it seemed that every big case in Australia needed Tom Hughes. Sportspeople, media personalities and even judges sought his counsel. At one point, Tom found himself defending Gough Whitlam in a New South Wales court while simultaneously seeking an order against Mr Whitlam in an ACT court. They were totally unrelated cases, but such was his reputation that everyone was happy with the arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tom Hughes is known for his courtroom manner. It's sometimes said that he was 'frosty Tom'. I won't deny him this mystique, myth and reputation, but that has not been my experience of him. Tom Hughes is warm, generous, wise and thoughtful. He's been a dear counsellor, mentor and friend to me, as he has been to so many people. I was honoured that he attended this chamber for my maiden speech, and I value his friendship greatly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tom is a man with a devoted family who bring him immense joy, including his wife, Chrissie; his children, Tom, Lucy and Michael; his grandchildren; and his great-grandchildren. So happy birthday, Tom Hughes, and congratulations on this wonderful milestone.</span>

His has been a very full life and a life well lived—a life in which he has sought to deliver on his principles. He was a servant in this House but also a very significant figure in legal circles in Sydney, New South Wales and, indeed, Australia. On behalf of the government, I wish him all the very best on this extraordinary milestone of a 100th birthday.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms PAYNE:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the report of the inquiry into local governance on Norfolk Island, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Restoring </span><span style="font-style:italic;">democracy</span>. This inquiry was referred earlier this year by the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, the Hon. Kristy McBain. A key focus of the committee's work was local governance models and equitable revenue sources to support the Norfolk Island Regional Council. The committee's inquiry followed the suspension of the Norfolk Island Regional Council in 2021 and the introduction of administrative arrangements for a three-year period. The committee recognises the pain these changes caused the Norfolk Island community, the subsequent democratic deficit they left and the strong desire of Norfolk Islanders to have a voice in the election of their local government representatives. It is hoped that the recommendations presented in this report can restore democracy to Norfolk Island and play a part in rebuilding the relationship and trust between Norfolk Island and the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations in this report present a case and potential process for the restoration of democracy through the establishment of a newly created democratically elected governing body on Norfolk Island. The committee recommends that a new bespoke model of local governance be legislated by the Australian government following thorough community consultation. This new governing body should include a mix of democratically elected members and Commonwealth appointed members. The committee has specifically recommended that the majority of members on the governing body be elected, with elected members holding the balance of power. The Commonwealth appointed members will be selected via a merit based process and have expertise in public administration, and preference will be given to qualified locals where possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular importance to the committee is recommendation 1, which proposes the development of a preamble for inclusion in the governing legislation. The purpose of this preamble is to recognise the culture and heritage of Norfolk Island, define the nature of the relationship between Norfolk Island and Australia and set out the shared aspirations for the future of the relationship. It is important that this preamble recognises the cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity of Norfolk Island and its residents. The committee places great emphasis on the preamble and views it as an important step in renewing the relationship between Norfolk Island and the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee understands and is sympathetic to the distress caused by the removal of the preamble in the governing legislation in 2015 and the years of uncertainty to have followed. I note that the process of developing a preamble is already underway through the newly elected governance committee, and our committee will be following their work closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the Norfolk Island community have a say on the draft preamble to be included in the governing legislation as well as the final form of the new governing body. It is recommended that a binding, compulsory vote to approve this final governing model take place prior to the end of next year. The recommendations presented in this report will contribute to the evolving policy landscape on Norfolk Island and the ongoing discussions about governance arrangements on the island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledges the newly formed Norfolk Island Governance Committee, which has been established to facilitate discussions with key stakeholders involved in on-island government service delivery and governance matters. It is recommending that the findings of the committee's report be referred to this governance committee for further consultation and refinement with the local community. Once the final governing body has been agreed to by the Norfolk Island community, the committee recommends that the responsibilities of the new body and the mechanism for local input into Commonwealth and state responsibilities be clearly defined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During this inquiry, the committee travelled to Norfolk Island to undertake site visits and public hearings. We were greeted with warmth and an open mind by local residents. We were able to witness firsthand the connection Norfolk Islanders have with their island and how this forms part of their unique identity and culture, distinct from mainland Australia. It is a beautiful part of the world, and the committee enjoyed our time there. I would like to sincerely thank those on Norfolk Island who engaged both respectfully and in good faith with us. The committee talked to people publicly and privately throughout the inquiry, and I hope you can all see your history, contributions and insights reflected in our report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would especially like to thank my fellow committee members for their hard work and ongoing engagement throughout the inquiry, particularly Deputy Chair Mrs Nola Marino. I want to particularly thank Mrs Marino; Mr Gosling, my Labor colleague; Senator McLachlan; and Senator Pocock, who travelled to Norfolk Island with the committee earlier in the year. I also want to thank our secretariat for their incredible work on this challenging report—Ms Fran Denny, the committee secretary; Mr James Bunce; and Ms Josephine Moa, the inquiry secretaries, for your really comprehensive work on what has been a challenging and very well done report. It is much appreciated and, without you, it would not be possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the report to the House.</span>

Equally, I wanted to thank all of those who gave evidence to the inquiry for doing so. I really wanted to encourage local people on Norfolk Island to make sure that they have their say in the governing body that is to come. I want to encourage all members to do so, including those who, for various reasons, did not give evidence at the hearings themselves.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I well understand some of the challenges of living and working in small communities, and dealing with people who have very strong opinions and influence in communities. But I want to encourage every individual on Norfolk Island to make sure they have their say so that the bespoke model that is developed reflects all the community's views and aspirations, particularly some of the younger members of the community and those who seek to make Norfolk Island their home. I want to make sure that the same people, as well, put their hands up for the governance opportunities that will come, ongoing, on Norfolk Island, and make sure they represent their community in the way that most represents the views of the people on Norfolk Island. Equally, on the focus through the report and for those on Norfolk Island on current and alternative revenue opportunities and options: in the longer-term, these are particularly important to the generations to come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I indicate the opposition's position in relation to this contingent notice of motion, this suspension of standing orders. The opposition's position is that we will be voting against this suspension of standing orders, although we have moved this amendment against the outcome that, despite the position we take, the government uses its numbers to get the suspension through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to explain to the House why the opposition is opposing this suspension of standing orders. I want to be absolutely clear: this is not because the opposition is not absolutely firmly and passionately committed to every necessary act to keep Australians safe and to protect our borders. This is an absolutely core priority of the opposition, of the coalition, of the Liberal Party and the National Party, and this has been our relentless focus over many years—the Howard government years and of course the years that we were in government from 2013 to 2022, under successive prime ministers. There is no greater commitment that the opposition has to keeping Australians safe and to ensuring that our borders are protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the issue here is not whether the opposition is prepared to engage, in good faith, with the government on the bill that was introduced by the minister at the table just around 2½ hours ago and about which the opposition was first provided with a briefing at 8 am this morning. The issue is not whether we are prepared to engage in good faith. Of course we are prepared to engage in good faith, and you need only look at the way that we engaged on these issues in the last sitting week, where we facilitated the passage of a bill through the House and the Senate which then came back to the House. Indeed, we did more than facilitate it; we greatly strengthened it, because it was a pretty desperate and inadequate job that was done by the government, after telling us for several days after the release of what was initially, I think, 81 dangerous criminals—and the number went up every day, every day—throughout that last sitting week, 'Oh well, nothing we can do; legislation is not an option.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government changed its position, on the Wednesday of the last sitting week, and it got to work on some legislation—it's just bizarre that it hadn't been a contingency plan, but they got to work on it that night, it would seem, and public servants were forced to work through the night—the opposition was briefed the next morning, and we moved very quickly. We did more than facilitate; we greatly improved. That is because of the deep experience of the Leader of the Opposition—an experienced and effective Minister for Home Affairs as well as a defence minister—and of other senior coalition figures, including, I might say, the member for Wannon, a distinguished and senior although youthful-looking senior coalition parliamentarian. The experience with these issues from this side of the House was absolutely critical in engaging constructively and improving that legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, it is not a question of being prepared to engage constructively. We are engaging constructively. That engagement is occurring, between the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister and between the shadow minister for immigration, the shadow minister for home affairs and the shadow Attorney-General and their opposite numbers. That engagement is occurring. We simply say that the particular sequencing and timing that is occurring now is something that could have been done on a cooperative basis. We will work quickly and efficiently. But the processes and procedures of this House are there for a very good reason. This House needs to be able to engage in scrutiny. We've demonstrated that we can do that quickly. Of course we stand ready to do that quickly. But there needs to be mutual respect and constructive mutual engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me be very clear. The issue is not whether this opposition stands ready to work very quickly in the interests of the Australian people to improve deficient legislation put forward by the government, to suggest policy measures that they may not have thought of themselves—and, sadly, that appears to be a bit of a pattern in this area. We stand ready to do all of that. But it is important that there is some proper process and some appropriate respect for the role of the parliament. So, we will be voting against the suspension of standing orders, because this proposes that this debate be truncated to an hour. There are important questions to be worked through here, and the opposition of course stands ready to engage in a constructive process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I emphasise that that engagement is occurring right now. But what we have not heard from the Leader of the House is any attempt to justify to this House, to explain, why this matter needs to be dealt with in the form of a debate that lasts for an hour. If it is a question of turning this around quickly, this side of the House, the coalition opposition, has a proven readiness and capability to do that. If that means that we are speaking till late at night or early in the morning, we have shown we are prepared to do that. But what we do question—and we will therefore be voting against it—is the particular nature of this suspension, which crunches down debate to one hour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This opposition, the Liberal and National parties, stand ready to engage constructively on these very important issues. But there are a range of questions which we naturally need to be satisfied of on the merits of the bill that was shared with the opposition at only eight o'clock this morning and was introduced by the minister at around 20 past one today. There is a series of important and meaningful questions. We are interested to understand, for example, what arrangements are in place to ensure the appropriate powers of state and territory police so that they are able to exercise relevant powers in relation to the cohort of released detainees. The point I make is not to litigate those issues on their merits now, because that would not be appropriate. The point I make is that there is a set of important issues and questions which have become evident to the opposition on the basis of the fairly brief opportunity we have had to this point to examine the legislation which was introduced by the minister at around 1.20 this afternoon and which was first shared with the opposition at around 8 am today. I do make the point that we have had more than a week where the parliament hasn't been sitting, and it is somewhat mystifying why the government felt it was only necessary to share this legislation with the opposition at eight o'clock today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, nevertheless, what is most important here is the safety of Australian citizens and protecting Australia's borders. Sadly, the lights are flashing amber, at the very least, in relation to the scale of risk that we face on this front. There may be others with more expertise on this subject matter who would say that is far too generous an assessment. But the point I simply make is that we want to move quickly, but the government has not explained why it needs to crunch the debate down to one hour and why it is not committing to the ordinary scrutiny that would occur. Again, I emphasise that it is not a question of the opposition not being prepared to move rapidly. Of course we are. But we also want to bring to bear our proven expertise and the proven expertise of senior figures on this side of the House. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment that I have and that, secondly, we will be voting against the suspension of standing orders.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  Labor is dancing to the Liberals' tune. Labor is letting the Liberals' write anti-refugee legislation and then it is rushing it through parliament. Labor clearly learned nothing from the last week we were here. Last time we were here the Leader of the Opposition led a fear campaign based on misinformation that sought to demonise refugees, and Labor caved in. Labor caved in and let the opposition write legislation and rush it through parliament without any kind of scrutiny or consideration of the implications of it. Here we are back again a week later with more rushed legislation, some of which we hear is about fixing up errors that were made in the rush last time without giving the parliament time to scrutinise it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are dealing with some of the most serious issues that confront this parliament—namely, questions of liberty, how to deal with the Constitution and the relationship between this parliament and the High Court. The High Court has said previous approaches from Labor and Liberal governments that are based on just taking people and locking them up indefinitely are unlawful—that you can't do that; that that's not the basis for an immigration system. In response, we here in this parliament should be saying, 'Let's have a sober discussion, taking the time that is necessary, about what a constitutional migration system might look like in this country.' We as the Greens would say that's one based on Australia joining other countries in the rest of the world and saying you don't have indefinite immigration detention, because locking people up forever is not a way to keep the community safe and not a way to deal with our immigration laws, and now we know it's unconstitutional. But, instead, what happened last time? The Leader of the Opposition ran a scare campaign, and Labor caved in. Labor caved in and passed legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said at the time that that is not a way to deal with these issues, and here we are back again, the very next week, dealing with one bit of legislation that might even turn into another one in the course of today or the course of this week. And we got to see the legislation this morning! This is legislation to deal with questions of what the High Court can and can't do, apparently, from our quick look at it. This is legislation to deal with the relationship between parliament and the most senior court in this country, and we're told we've got an hour to debate it. We've got less than a day to have a look at it, to go and get legal advice, to work out whether there could be unintended consequences of it—less than a day—and less than an hour to even debate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government may as well just be done with it and appoint the Leader of the Opposition the new home affairs minister. That's how much he is running the show. This ought to ring huge alarm bells in this country because the Leader of the Opposition has made his history and his political career out of punching down and demonising people. I remember when he said that people in my town of Melbourne were scared to go out because of African gangs—absolutely demonising, monstrous language. We know what he's done with refugees and migrants in this country. We've seen how much he's prepared to demonise them and mislead the public about what happens when people come here seeking our help, and how he's tried to turn people into second-class citizens by removing their rights. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When even the High Court says, 'No, hang on, actually there are some limits to this. There are some limits to saying you're going to start stripping away people's rights and locking them up forever,' that should be a warning to the Labor government that the previous approaches led by the Liberals are the wrong way to go. But, no, Labor rolls over and lets the Leader of the Opposition tickle its tummy and says, 'Here are the instructions for the legislation; why don't you have the drafter's phone number? Just draft the legislation yourself and come back here, and we as the Labor government will rush it through parliament without giving anyone the time to scrutinise it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to Labor and I said this last time—they clearly haven't learnt the lesson, so I'll say it again: don't engage in a race to the bottom with the opposition; don't engage in a race to the bottom with the Leader of the Opposition, because there's nowhere he won't go. If you follow the moral compass of the opposition, you're going to find yourself at the bottom of the ocean. So, Labor, stop engaging in a race to the bottom with the coalition. Stop letting the Leader of the Opposition write your legislation. Let's have a sober debate about what a proper migration system in this country looks like and give this parliament the time to debate it—not one hour.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I rise to oppose both this contingent motion and indeed the amendment from the Manager of Opposition Business, both for the same reasons. The Manager of Opposition Business indicated that they had first eyes on this bill at eight o'clock this morning. Well, the crossbench had first eyes on at around 9.30. This is important legislation—so important that the government wishes to implement it urgently but not important enough that members of this place can undertake due diligence and sound scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I oppose this contingent motion and the amendment on the grounds of good governance. This is not good governance. Each and every member of this place is elected to be a conscientious legislator, and I cannot in any way return to my community and say, 'I gave this bill conscientious scrutiny.' I simply cannot. Since the briefing this morning, I have sought to get independent legal advice. No-one was available in this short period of time. I've sought advice from academics. They said they'd try and call me this evening. This is simply not good enough. It's simply no way to go back to the Australian people and give them confidence that what we do in this place not only stands up to the scrutiny of those of us who are sent here to vote on it but also stands up to the scrutiny of the High Court itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really disturbing. I agree with the Manager of Opposition Business. I would be happy to stay here into the evening, for as long as it takes, to give people the amount of time they require to engage in solid debate. This bill is so important; it deserves that at the very least. I can't continue to support government contingent motions that ask us to rush through legislation with the narrowest opportunity to engage with the legislation in any meaningful way. For me, it's an absolute no to this contingent motion. The Manager of Opposition Business seeks to amend the bill, which advantages the opposition by a factor of only a few more minutes for the shadow minister. It does nothing to assist anybody else in the House, so I want this recorded: I simply cannot support this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I rise because we need to not agree to this motion to suspend standing orders, because there are many reasons about which we need a lot more explanation from the government before we agree to these further amendments. For instance, we have just found out that reasons will be published in NZYQ v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs &amp; Anor at 2.15 pm on Tuesday 28 November 2023. So, the reasons for the High Court decision will be given tomorrow. Why we are rushing this now beggars belief. This is particularly so when we know that these amendments are being rushed. We were told to meet with the government at eight o'clock this morning. We were presented with the amendments, and we could tell that the amendments were basically finalised at 4.20 last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that the government has just rushed this approach, and that is not the way to take national security seriously. One of the reasons they might have rushed this and tried to combine it with the citizenship cessation legislation relates to what was in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> over the weekend, 'The subtle art of not giving'—an unparliamentary word—referring to a No. 1 bestseller. The article says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Inside the chaos of Government handballing of GPS trackers as detainee criminals still roam streets without care … the Federal agency tasked with tracking killers and child sex offenders freed from immigration detention may not even have the power to do so as fallout from the High Court judgement continues. It comes as several agencies pass the buck on getting, supplying or using the GPS devices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This just seems to be one mess after another from this government when it comes to immigration. We've heard the ministers referred to as 'hopeless and hapless'—maybe 'dumber and dumber'; I don't know. There are a lot of people who are saying a lot of things, because the way that this is being handled seriously beggars belief. And now, when the High Court will be handing down its reasons tomorrow and those reasons could allow us to legislate—and legislate in a way that keeps the community safe—the government seems to be rushing these amendments through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the focus in here? I think it's because of the politics of it. At the moment, we know that there is one detainee who is out in the community and whose location the government doesn't know. So there is one detainee out in the community, and the government does not know where they are. What has been the transparency around that? Do we know anything about their whereabouts, the efforts that are being taken or what is occurring with regard to that one person? No. But this just seems rushed, maybe because the government doesn't want to be upfront about that. We also know that there is noncompliance with three other cases which have been referred to the AFP. We don't know much about those either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now 138 former detainees that have now been freed. I'd say to the Greens, 'You need to think about this again,' because I think a Senate inquiry around the decision that went into the High Court making the final decision and the government's approach to it is something that should be looked at and investigated. There are serious questions—including about what the minister for immigration signed off on, which might have led to the case failing—that need to be looked at, but I'll have more to say on that later. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I'd like to start by acknowledging that, as parliamentarians, our first and foremost responsibility is the safety of our communities. Following the High Court's decision that indefinite detention is unconstitutional, there is understandable concern about the potential risks to public safety from the release of some of those who were detained. I share those concerns. Some of the people in this cohort have committed serious offences in the past, including offences which are violent and sexual in nature. And so it is absolutely right that we have a serious and reasoned debate in this place about how to ensure public safety whilst adhering to the High Court judgement, which found that indefinite immigration detention is illegal. This is a complex issue, one which requires the parliament to weigh up individual liberty and community security and to find the appropriate balance. This is not an issue to politicise or rush.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we did not have a serious and reasoned debate last time. We had wedge politics and fearmongering, and we had legislation rushed through in less than a day. This is not the appropriate way to determine laws that govern this country. So, given the rushed nature of the debate in this place just 11 days ago, I'm very disappointed to see the government do the same all over again. Other members of the crossbench and I were briefed on this legislation at 9.30 this morning, and yet we are being asked to debate and vote again on this bill on the very same day. We have just one hour for debate and a time limit of five minutes per speaker. The vast majority who will want to speak will not get a chance. It is not adequate. It is not a chance for debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  The immigration mess keeps getting bigger and bigger by the day.

As a matter of fact, the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper summed it up pretty well—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TEHAN:</span>
                    </a>  as 'the subtle art of not giving a'—I won't use that unparliamentary language. It talks about the complete and utter mess the government is making of its attempts to deal with this High Court decision—so much so that now they've rushed these further amendments into the parliament when we've just found out that the High Court are going to give us the reasons for their decision tomorrow. At a minimum we should be waiting until we get those reasons to see whether these amendments go far enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, last week, or the week before, when they introduced their amendments we said at the time, 'Too little, too late.' That's exactly what they were, and we had to strengthen them for the government. We should be sensible about how we proceed, not be told as an opposition that the government is going to introduce these amendments and there will be a meeting at eight o'clock in the morning, and we get handed the bill with the amendments which was finished at 4.17 pm last night—rushed. And they expect the parliament to just say they're the government and they should be listened to, and this is what they should do, when their track record when it comes to keeping the community safe is deplorable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there is one reason and one reason only why we are here today with these amendments before us—that is, the government is using them as a distraction to take the focus off their track record. Let's have a look at the track record currently: 138 former detainees now free in the community. Four of them, we know, have not complied with the amendments which went through the House over a week ago, and one of them is AWOL; one of them can't be found and hasn't been contactable. We don't know anything about that person. The other three have been referred to the AFP. We don't know the exact status of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything that we've had from this government when it comes to this issue has shown how ham-fisted their response has been. They had nearly six months to prepare for the High Court decision, yet all we got immediately after the High Court decision was: 'Oh, it's all too hard. We're going to have to wait for the reasons. There's nothing we can do.' Well, the community said that wasn't good enough, the media said that wasn't good enough and the opposition said that wasn't good enough, and eventually the government was forced to act in a way where they led completely with their chin by introducing legislation which they said were the toughest laws that had ever been introduced. Yet, within the space of about 12 hours, they'd actually had to bow to opposition pressure and make the laws and give them real teeth because of their inept handling of this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still many, many more questions that need to be answered by the government when it comes to this issue. For instance, why did the government concede on 30 May it was not possible to deport NZYQ when it only approached Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and the Five Eyes nations after that date? The minister for immigration said on 30 May it was not possible to deport NZYQ. So he almost threw in the towel on 30 May. Then it seems that, after that date, the government decided: 'This could work against us. This could work against community safety.' They then tried to fix it up by approaching Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and the Five Eyes nations after that date to see whether they would take NZYQ. Why did Minister O'Neil, in complete contradiction of the minister for immigration, say last week that she had operational advice 'it was likely' the government could deport NZYQ when this case indicates the precise opposite? We saw questions along these lines asked of the government today, and they didn't want to go anywhere near answering them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other question we need answered is: did the minister for immigration, in making that call on 30 May, get that signed off jointly with the Minister for Home Affairs, the Attorney-General, the cabinet or the Prime Minister? Or was the Prime Minister's lack of attention to detail also exposed in this? There are so many answers that we need to hear from the government, and yet they refuse to give them to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this morning, when we had our briefing, which was then followed by another briefing because we couldn't get the answers that we wanted, we put to the government serious questions about these amendments. We still haven't got very clear-cut answers from the government on these. These are serious issues that we need answering. The Prime Minister has received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition talking about the issues that we think need addressing if we are to support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that we are still waiting to hear clearly about the approach that the government will take. But, if the government were serious, it would enter into a proper bipartisan process with the opposition to do this properly. It would not just drop a letter on a Sunday night and then say, 'You have to be at a briefing at eight o'clock' and then—this is what the government did—not even have the head of the Australian Border Force turn up. But guess when he did turn up? They then did a press conference half an hour later, and guess who was there to answer questions on operational matters? The head of Border Force. This is the type of bipartisanship that the government is seeking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to remember what this is about. This is about the No. 1 priority that any government has, which is keeping the community safe. You will remember that 10 days ago we had to remind the government that there were victims out in the Australian community of some of the people that they had released and that those victims didn't know what was happening. They didn't know what protections were going to be put in place for them. They were scared. They were themselves having to ring up to find out information about what the government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to the government: rather than rushing these amendments through and treating us as if we have to either put up or shut up, when the real expertise lies on this side of the House when it comes to keeping the nation safe, why don't you, in the very first instance, put all your focus on finding out where that one detainee whose whereabouts they don't know is? That should be the government's No. 1 priority. The next should be making sure that the amendments we put through the week before last are fully implemented and then working with us to get through proper amendments which will keep the community safe.</span>

Labor might as well be done with it and just make Peter Dutton the Minister for Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor seems to have learnt nothing from the last week we were here, when the High Court made a significant decision. We should all have reflected on that decision soberly and worked out how to construct an immigration system in the face of a very clear finding from the High Court. The High Court said you can't just lock people up indefinitely in immigration detention and put them in a warehouse and think that's the answer, because that is illegal. In response to that, the opposition ran a fear campaign and said, 'Oh, the government's letting people out,' when in fact it was the High Court that did it. So what did the government do? Instead of saying, 'Well, let's have a discussion in this place about how we construct a proper refugee system and migration system based on the new High Court findings,' they panicked. The opposition ran a fear campaign and Labor caved in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, the Greens, were the only ones in this place to vote against Labor and the Liberals were doing. We said at the time, 'Don't engage in a race to the bottom with the opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, because there's no low he won't sink to,' and that is exactly what has happened. Here we are back again the next week, and already the opposition is saying, 'Oh, no, it's not good enough, you've got to do more.' If you give in to this guy, he is going to keep coming back for more, Labor. So have some spine. Stand up to the Leader of the Opposition and argue for a principled approach that respects what the High Court has said and gives us the time to work out what a response to that would be and what a decent migration system that respects what the High Court has just said would look like in this country. In an effort to appease the Leader of the Opposition, Labor has rushed legislation in here, and already the opposition are saying, 'Oh, it's not good enough; we need more.' This is exactly the point that we were making: don't engage in a race to the bottom with the Leader of the Opposition, because he will just keep asking for more and sinking lower and lower and lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may have escaped the attention of the government, but at the last election their vote went backwards, and we now have a situation in this country where less than a third of the country votes for the government, a bit more than one-third votes for the opposition, and a third votes for someone else and says, 'We're sick of these dirty deals that get done between Labor and Liberal when you're acting in a way that is not in the public interest and you're not bringing integrity to politics.' With a third of the country now saying that they want the magnifying glass put over what politicians do in this place, Labor, instead of listening, just caves in, comes here and says, 'You've got an hour to debate a very significant piece of legislation that's potentially about giving the High Court more powers.' We're talking about changing the relationship between the parliament and the High Court, on what limited information we've got from Labor, and they want us to debate it in an hour—a bill that we haven't even seen for a day. Well, I say this to you, Labor: this legislation may well end up back in the High Court. You may well come here again, wanting another piece of legislation to tidy up the errors in the first piece of legislation that you did because the Liberals rushed you into it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is no way to run a country—to hand over the keys to the opposition. Labor are handing over the keys to Peter Dutton and then wondering why it is that they're suffering as a result. Well, no. If you want to deal with the challenges this country faces, then think about them soberly, do it in a way that puts the public interest first, that respects this place, and then you might start getting a bit more respect from the people. But you are asking us to rush through legislation that we saw for the first time this morning, dealing with one of the most significant issues in this parliament, and that is something that we will oppose.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023. Let's be clear. The reason we are here, the reason we are debating this, the reason that Labor is seeking to rush through this legislation and has guillotined debate for an hour, is the woeful mismanagement of this very important area of public policy by the Albanese Labor government. There is no more important responsibility of the Australian government than keeping the Australian people safe. If it is your objective to keep the Australian people safe, that is not an objective which is achieved or advanced by throwing open the gates of detention facilities and releasing into the community what we were initially told would be some 81 people. Each day that number rose and rose and rose, and we learnt that, amongst these people who have been released, are murderers, rapists, people who have committed sexual assaults on children—in one case on a 10-year-old. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a group of people who have been released into the community by the Albanese Labor government, putting the Australian people at risk. And it is far from clear that this government knows where those people are. It is far from clear that it has actually yet managed to execute one element of the policy approach—which was agreed at short notice, thanks to Labor's mismanagement, just over a week ago—which was that every one of these people would be required to wear an ankle bracelet so that their locations could be monitored, in the interests of public safety. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The root cause of what has happened here is that the Albanese Labor government completely failed to make contingency plans for what was, on any view, a highly foreseeable contingency—that the High Court would rule in the way it did just two and a bit weeks ago—with the consequence that it was urgent that the government have a contingency plan in place to avoid the scenario in which this group of dangerous and highly undesirable people were released into the community with no measures being taken to protect the safety of the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we now know is that the government has drafted further legislation which will amend provisions which were agreed by the parliament and legislated a little over a week ago. The opposition was provided with this bill at eight o'clock this morning. We have a number of questions about it. We want to be satisfied, for example, that it does not amount to a winding-back or a weakening of measures which were legislated by the parliament just a week and a bit ago. That is what we want to be satisfied of on behalf of the Australian people. We want to know whether the measures in this bill could include the potential watering down of strict visa conditions agreed just under two weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of other questions that we want to be satisfied on. What arrangements are in place to ensure that state and territory police are able to exercise relevant powers in relation to the cohort of released detainees? Do state and territory governments need to give their consent before powers can validly be conferred on authorised officers who are state or territory officials? Are state or territory officials empowered by this legislation and its interaction with other relevant legislation, including state legislation, to apply, remove, maintain and reapply electronic monitoring devices? So there are a range of questions that the government needs to provide satisfactory answers to. Sadly, this is a rushed and chaotic process, and the opposition certainly calls for those answers.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  Indeed, as the previous speaker has said, we are in a farcical situation where this legislation has been thrown into the parliament with the slimmest consultation whatsoever as the government is desperately playing catch-up on a situation they should have been absolutely adequately prepared for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a few weeks ago the High Court handed down a decision. That was imminent, and you never know exactly how courts are going to determine things, but you certainly make contingencies. When it comes to the safety of the people of this country, you absolutely make contingencies. If there was any chance—the slightest chance—that a court decision could have resulted in hardened criminals such as murderers, rapists and paedophiles being released into the Australian community, a responsible government would have had a plan in place to do whatever was necessary to update the Commonwealth legislation to prevent that from happening. We know that, instead, the government was caught in a state of shock about the decision and had no plan whatsoever to do anything to address that situation until the Leader of the Opposition stepped in and provided the leadership that the government should have: to insist on this parliament taking every opportunity to immediately address the circumstance that we are in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the Leader of the Greens: the Opposition Leader is running the country on this issue, because, if it weren't for the Leader of the Opposition last sitting week and the happy coincidence of the Prime Minister also being out of the country, action to pass legislation couldn't have been taken with no Prime Minister here and the acting Prime Minister acquiescing to all of the things that we suggested needed to be done to take the necessary immediate steps that the parliament could take to try to keep Australians safe. That's what happened, and I commend the Leader of the Opposition for the leadership that he brought to the parliament that day, for the action that was taken on the initiative of the Leader of the Opposition and other shadow ministers, who governed in an absence of the actual government, which should have had all the advice and all the preparedness that we assume that they would have had to take action if that decision were made. We nonetheless were prepared to immediately step into the void left by the government and insist on this parliament doing what ultimately we did the other week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But now we find ourselves in a farcical situation where we are being asked to pass through this parliament this other legislation that no-one really knew anything about until today. We've got a lot of concern and hesitation about this government's competence when it comes to legislating in this area. Two weeks ago, they didn't even want to legislate at all, and we shamed them into it. We said there are dangerous people out there who pose a risk to the safety of Australians—people who are out there tapdancing down the streets of the major CBDs of this country; convicted, hardened criminals who are not Australian citizens and who should not be in this country at all but particularly should not be freely walking the streets in and amongst the Australian community, at a huge risk and threat to them. At that point, the government was going to do nothing until we shamed them into it. Now we've got a situation where legislation is before us that we know hardly anything about and have hardly any understanding of its justification. We now hear that the High Court will be handing down the reasoning for their determination tomorrow. Yet we're debating this bill right now in a conflated period of time and in an environment where, I have to say, we've got very little confidence in a government that has mucked up this issue from go to whoa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first job of any government is to keep the people of their country safe, and this government has failed on that spectacularly. The people of this country have not been kept safe through this whole tawdry ordeal, where hardened criminals have been released into the community. We've been talking in this parliament today, quite appropriately, about violence against women, and at the same time we've got a situation where convicted rapists are in our community, at risk of reoffending. So, we as a parliament want to do everything that's necessary to protect the people of this country. We've been taking the lead on this, and through the leadership of the opposition leader we saw legislation pass through this parliament in the last sitting period that goes some way, in the limited time we had and through the limited options we have as a legislative body, to keep Australians safe. But we don't have a government that is prioritising that. People have lost confidence in this government to do the fundamental most important thing that governments need to do, which is keep the people of this country safe. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  In the last sitting week, or in fact prior to the last sitting week, on 8 November, the High Court handed down its decision in which it ruled that indefinite detention of these detainees was illegal. Those opposite, the government, said there was nothing they could do. We on this side of the House were urging them to introduce legislation to keep Australians safe, because, as everybody I think seems to recognise in this place—not just government but every member in this place and the other place—each of us has no greater responsibility than to keep Australians safe. But the government said, 'No, there's nothing we can do; we can't legislate.' They came in here the week after that, on the Monday, saying, 'Can't legislate' and on Tuesday, 'Can't legislate' and on Wednesday, 'Can't legislate.' Then—hey presto!—do you know what happened on Thursday morning? They asked to brief the leadership of the opposition and they threw a bill on the table and said: 'There you go. There's the bill. Take it or leave it.' They gagged debate. They wouldn't allow any amendments. It went up to the Senate. And for reasons that are unknown to me, the Acting Prime Minister had perhaps a moment of reason and decided: 'Well, actually, do you know what? Those amendments that the Leader of the Opposition was proposing in that meeting on the Thursday morning actually make sense. Here's a guy who has dedicated his life to keeping Australians safe, has acted as immigration minister, has acted as home affairs minister and has been a police officer. Maybe we should do this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government came from a position of, 'There's nothing we can do' to introducing legislation, but without accepting any amendments, to then accepting the amendments of the Leader of the Opposition. But what's really concerning here, what's troubling me, is that we now know that there are 141 detainees who have apparently been released into the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the home affairs minister was challenged as to why the government hadn't done anything to put some contingencies in place in the ensuing period between July of this year, when they seemed to get a heads-up from the High Court as to how this was going to go, and 8 November, the home affairs minister went on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Agenda</span> with Andrew Clennell on Sky and indicated, 'We were advised that it was likely that the Commonwealth would win the case—that is, allow us to do what we wanted to do, which is keep these people in detention. That's what she told Sky News's<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Agenda</span> on 19 November. But what we now know, as a result of some good work done by Andrew Clennell, is that while she was saying those things she was in furious discussions with other countries and with the embassy in DC, trying to ensure that this individual, NZYQ, was deported from this country. It's really quite interesting. There was an email from David Gavin from Home Affairs dated 1 September 2023. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister for Home Affairs views this case of the utmost importance and wishes all avenues (including difficult ones) progressed. No stone should be left unturned would be an apt summary. I think a further discussion is warranted on the approach to Bangladesh, making further enquiries, and third country options for engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Minister for Home Affairs is out there trying to get rid of this bloke, trying to get him off to another country. All the while, she's saying, 'We're not doing anything, because we think we're going to win the case.' Which is correct? The Australian people deserve answers from this home affairs minister, yet none are forthcoming.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I too rise to speak on this issue and the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023. I find myself in the rather strange position where, for once, I agree with the Leader of the Greens. We've known each other for a long time, and we don't agree very much, but I do agree with his point that this is rushed. If I'm agreeing with the Leader of the Greens, then clearly the government has taken a wrong turn on this one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government isn't easy. The Australian people expect the government of the day to make tough decisions, not always universally popular, and to also show wisdom and foresight. We clearly have seen the minister caught napping on this issue—sitting back waiting for the High Court decision and then, when it didn't go as planned, not having a plan B in place, which saw the release of those very undesirable people into the general public. I understand that some of those have basically disappeared into the populace and no-one really knows where they are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger picture on this is that it shows up the blind spot that the Labor Party have when it comes to illegal migration. No-one understands more than I do the need for migrants to come to this country. No-one understands more than me the needs of people who are at risk, who have extreme stress. We're very generous. We bring in more refugees on top of our regular migration intake, on a per capita basis, than pretty well anywhere else in the world. But there's a reason why we need to have processes around that. I know there are frustrations at times. Where I don't agree with the Leader of the Greens is basically—without wanting to put words in his mouth—believing we should be kinder and open the borders and allow more refugees to come through. We need to manage this because what we've seen is that in that tide of genuine refugees is a pathway for people with serious character flaws, people of a criminal nature, to come through in the guise of refugees and then become established in Australia. That's what's happened. Those people had been identified. They were still in detention. The High Court decision meant that the government needed to react. They've been slow to react. They're basically making this up as they go along. It was only a few hours ago these amendments were brought into the parliament, and now a decision needs to be made that is basically going to have a serious impact on the way we deal with illegal refugees, illegal comers to this country, who are not the desirable types of people that we want to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a little bit of deja vu. One of the advantages of having been around here for a long time is I can remember, in 2008, when then Prime Minister Rudd spoke about what he believed were the draconian and evil measures of the Howard government and how Australia was going to be a kinder, more welcoming nation. Within a few short years, we had 50,000 people turn up on our shores. People drowned at sea at the hands of the people-smugglers. We ended up having a huge mess to fix up. This is a classic example.</span>

They've got an issue to fix, and they're doing it on the run and using the house of the people in a very shoddy way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I want to thank those speakers who have contributed to what is a very important bill and debate for the chamber to consider, on the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023. To recap, we're here today because the High Court have handed down their decision. The government had due notice of it back in June, when the first indication from the High Court was given to the government that there would potentially be an issue. The matter was ultimately decided by the High Court, and we now learn that reasons for the judgement will be handed down tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation is that the government had options available to them to prevent people with serious criminal histories—people of significantly bad character, people who had committed murder, sexual offences against women and children, and other serious offences—from being released into the community. The government had the option to bring forward legislation, and in the last parliamentary week, as many will recall, there was a shambolic attempt by the home affairs minister and the immigration minister to patch something together at the eleventh hour, drafting legislation through the night. It will doubtless come as no surprise to anyone in this place that we're here today to patch up some of the deficiencies in the laws designed by the Labor Party at the eleventh hour, Labor having said for the first part of the last sitting week that it was not possible to pass legislation to address some of these concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We find ourselves, as the honourable member for Parkes pointed out a minute ago, with a case of deja vu. We had advice yesterday, on Sunday evening, that there would be a briefing available to the coalition this morning. We arrived at the briefing for the coalition this morning. The two ministers were there. Again, the documents had been put together in a hasty fashion. They had not been properly considered. This is well and truly designing of a bill on the run, and on such a serious issue the government stands condemned in that regard. I've had three meetings with the Prime Minister today, and I'm grateful for his time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The resolve of the coalition is to make sure that whatever can be done is done to take these people back into immigration detention. That's what would provide the safest outcome for the Australian public over this Christmas holiday period: for these people, and potentially hundreds more, not to be in the community but to be back in immigration detention. There should be a preventative detention regime as part of this bill, and it should be drafted with haste by the government. Obviously, once the outcome is provided tomorrow by the High Court, it can be in accordance with the advice from the High Court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposition at the moment is that this is being rushed through the lower house and then it's going to sit. So it's not going to the upper house, where advised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We said this to the government early this morning: 'Don't rush this bill. There's no need to suspend standing orders, because you haven't properly drafted this bill. There are flaws all through it, and it has no mention of preventative detention whatsoever.' The ministers who made the grave errors of judgement and embarrassed the Prime Minister in his absence in the last sitting week have been let loose again, but the Prime Minister, to his credit, is stepping up and addressing some of the very legitimate concerns, but this should not be before the House now. Why would you rush this bill through overnight when the High Court is providing its reasons tomorrow? Originally that was to be in February of next year. But now we find out the High Court delivers its reasons for the judgement tomorrow, so why would the government seek to rush it through? Because these two ministers don't have a single clue between them! And that's the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that there is an option available to the government to stop these people in their tracks and to stop them from committing further crimes and being able to take them back into immigration detention, and that is what we commit to working with the government on over the course of the sitting week. If we need to sit on Friday or over the weekend or next week, then we will do that, but we will make sure that the coalition holds this government to account, because, at the moment, they've released people into the community who shouldn't be there.</span>

We let people out of jail who have served their sentence every day, and here we're creating some additional draconian conditions on a particular group of people. This legislation requires a delicate balance between community safety and human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the government needed to respond to the High Court's decision in finding an appropriate balance. We've been locking people up indefinitely for so long here in Australia that it has become normalised, but it shouldn't have come as a complete surprise that the High Court might find that we can't lock people up indefinitely. I don't accept that the government should somehow defy the High Court and put people in immigration detention in direct contravention of the High Court's finding. We have a separation of our powers for a reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government passed urgent legislation a few weeks ago in a process that didn't allow much time at all for consideration about the proportionality of the offences created and with some fairly draconian amendments that were agreed in the Senate. And now, today, we have an amendment. I understand that one of the things that this amendment does is to fix an omission in last week's bill, creating three new offences to correspond to these newly created and fairly draconian conditions, but I have concerns about some of the amendments that purportedly add clarity about electronic monitoring arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of it seems to be addressing rushed drafting, shifting powers from regulation into the legislation, but one amendment changes section 76F(2) so that personal information can be given to any person for a range of reasons. This seems very broad. Purposes listed include 'protecting the community' and 'facilitating the location of a person'. Maybe this is appropriate, but, given we first heard about it eight hours ago and my one advisor and I have been busy all day on the other work of parliament, I've not had time to make a sensible decision about whether it is reasonable. I haven't had time to consult my community, I haven't had time to consult experts and I don't think we can make decisions about laws that seriously impact people's rights in such a hurry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has indicated that the legislation is likely to need to be amended after the High Court's reasons are handed down, but it refuses to include a sunset clause on these hurriedly drafted new laws. And we hear the High Court may hand down its findings as early as tomorrow, which makes it slightly ridiculous to be passing legislation today. We need to pause on this. We need to listen to the High Court's reasons for decision. We need to be very careful about removing individual rights without proper, sober consideration and debate. So, I will not be supporting this bill. It may well be proportionate. It may well be required. Once we see the High Court's reasons, it may well be consistent with those reasons. But, without adequate time to consult, I'm not comfortable supporting any further reduction of rights or creation of new offences.</span>

The first priority of this government should be the defence of its citizenry. All Australians deserve to feel safe in their communities. The debate around this unfortunate situation in the last two or three weeks has engendered many feelings of insecurity and concern in Australians in a way which is I think probably unnecessary but also extremely unfortunate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent decision that the indefinite detention of the immigrants under discussion today is illegal is a decision of the High Court. The government initially prevaricated in the face of that decision. It appears to have been caught flat-footed and then to have reacted in a knee-jerk fashion in response to sustained pressure from the opposition which appears to be more political than legal in its basis. It then presented us, at the end of the last sitting week, with a hastily concocted piece of legislation which challenged the rule of law and the separation of powers in this country. After it went to the Senate, it came back with draconian amendments which meant that we in this place would be legislating criminal penalties for individuals who, for whatever reason, failed to comply with that legislation. It is the job of the courts in this country to criminalise offences, not the job of this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now in a situation where that poorly concocted legislation has come back to us like a speeding bullet. We were presented with this additional legislation less than eight hours ago. We've been given no opportunity to consult our communities about it, to consult our constituents about it or to consult legal experts. We've now been given one hour to debate a piece of legislation which potentially changes the relationship between the High Court and the parliament of this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an appalling situation. This place should operate with consideration, with respect, with consultation and with thought. We shouldn't be reacting in the way that we are in response to the political pressure placed on the government by the opposition. We need our government to be better than that. We need it to set a standard that we can feel comfortable with. We need it to make us feel not only safe but also secure. I think I speak for many of my constituents in saying that it is with great disappointment that we see this piece of legislation presented to the parliament today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  This bill and what's going on here today is one of the lower points that we've seen in parliament, because what we've seen is a total fear campaign driven by an opposition bereft of policy, bereft of intelligence and bereft of an ability to actually think about the Australian community. They come in here with their bravado and their tough talk about how they're the tough cop on the beat, but what we've seen is the total opposite. All we've seen is a bunch of spineless people sitting there, striking fear into the hearts of Australians. For nine years in government, they did nothing. They sat on this and didn't do a thing, but they attack the government for trying to clean up another of their bits of mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course you shouldn't have people locked up in detention permanently if there were no crimes committed. But, if there are people who do commit crimes and people who are doing the wrong thing, then we need to make sure they're not on the streets. But what you see is hypocrisy from those opposite in the Liberal and National parties. I'm making sure I don't mention the orange collective over there—because it's a totally different kettle of fish—or the Greens. But we have seen the 'all talk, no action' of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what we've got today. We have a member of the opposition leadership team writing letters arguing for the release of a detainee—a child sex offender, no less. While the government were arguing in court to keep people detained—the Labor Party were out there, standing up and saying, 'We don't want to release people onto the street'—the Liberal Party were actively going out and saying that we should release people onto the street. They actually supported this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a letter from Senator Dean Smith, who wrote to plead the case for the child sex offender in immigration detention awaiting deportation. This individual had failed the character test and had had his refugee visa cancelled, yet we had a senior Liberal Party frontbencher arguing to have this person released into the community. This is the point we've been raising about this whole situation: it is not of our making but it's something that, as a hangover from the previous government, we've got to clean up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor side of the House were in court arguing to keep criminals locked up, those opposite in the Liberal Party did nothing, and now we find they're actively supporting the release of people like this into our community. On 22 September this year, a senior Liberal frontbencher wrote: 'After developing a relationship with the younger girl, he was convicted in 2015 for sexual penetration of a girl over the age of 13 and under the age of 16, including on a consensual and non-consensual basis.' The letter acknowledged that the crime had had a lasting effect on the victim, yet the opposition Liberal frontbencher actively supported the release. And not just once, because that letter wasn't enough—in February 2023 he again pleaded the case to support this individual being released; in fact, he said he'd make himself available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear a lot of talk from the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Dickson, Peter Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, likes to stand up, talk tough and pretend he's the big cop on the beat, but this is the real test. When it comes to keeping criminals off our streets, the other side of the House, the Liberal Party side, are out there advocating for their release, and it is this side of the House, the government side, that wants to keep them off the streets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if it had been a Labor MP who had written a letter like that. He'd be suspending standing orders. He'd be shutting down question time. The absolute faux outrage would be all over the place.</span>

So I say to the member for La Trobe: why would you do that? You'd do that because this is not about anything other than trying to make a political point in a political game for a leader of the opposition who, without a shadow of a doubt, fails every character test on leadership and statesmanship.</span>

It has blown up in his face, because publicly, while he's standing here with his faux outrage, pretending he's the tough cop on the beat, senior Liberal frontbenchers are quietly out there supporting these people to be out on the street.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I want to start by making one thing very, very clear. It is that, for 30 years, as a nation, we have practised law, and flagrantly so, in the face of international human rights law. The High Court ruling that came down on 8 October made one thing abundantly clear: it is not the place of the Australian parliament to punish individuals. At the moment, we know nothing more than that about what drove the ruling that came on 8 October, but what we do know is that the court said: 'No more.' No more will an Australian government decide that indefinite and arbitrary detention be something that can be exercised by the government. No more will Australians be asked to turn away as people languish in indefinite detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is that there is no such thing as a good crime, and we as a parliament must absolutely make sure that we do everything we can to keep our community safe. The truth of the matter is that we do not have the death penalty in Australia, and we do not have that because we do not support or believe in it. But arbitrary indefinite detention may as well be the death penalty, because these people have no way out. They have no way of knowing where they're going to be and they have nowhere to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a normal Australian, I have been incredibly frustrated by the colour of the debate in this place in the last 10 days. We have a government that has been handed a High Court ruling, and it is right and just that the government should listen to that High Court ruling and modify the behaviour and the legislation of this place based on that High Court ruling. It is inappropriate to have an opposition come out and make some sort of claim that it's within this parliament's power to ignore that ruling and simply legislate to lock people up. I would say in this place to all Australians: it is a very slippery slope when your government can make laws to lock you up with no recourse to the judicial system. Regardless of who this decision is impacting at the moment, every single Australian should be prepared to fight for the right which sees a separation between the judicial system and our parliamentary system. To muddy it in this way, to use this as a dog-whistling exercise to rally people around something which is inappropriate for our nation, is simply not becoming of this place and this parliamentary context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on all of us here, then, to move forward as a parliament in a calm fashion, debating what is appropriate for our society and deciding what's in the best interests of all Australians, for I fear that, the faster we rush this sort of legislative reform, the more mistakes we will make. We cannot simply legislate our way by applying layer upon layer of mismanagement. It's what got us here in the first place, and both major parties have contributed to that. The High Court ruling gives us an opportunity to hit control alt delete on our detention system in this country, and that's exactly what we should do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I rise to speak about my concern about the tactics and the words that are being used by those opposite to try to undermine the significant legislation, the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023, that we are endeavouring to introduce to ensure that Australians are safe from those who present a safety risk within our community. It is quite extraordinary that we have a Leader of the Opposition who is prepared to argue the merits of ignoring the High Court, having complete and utter disregard for the separation of powers, which exists for good reason, within our system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government has been getting on and working to make sensible and restrained legislation that's fit for purpose to deal with the risk at hand, we have had members of the opposition leadership team writing letters to the government asking for the release of a detainee, a child sex offender. Using the approach that the Leader of the Opposition would use, detailing the extraordinary gory details, this is a person who failed the character test. He had his refugee visa cancelled. He developed a relationship with a younger person. He was convicted in 2015. It was both consensual and non-consensual sex—that was the verdict. A person from the Liberal frontbench wrote that he knew that, in the time passed, it had still had a lasting effect on the victim, and yet he still suggested that this person had demonstrated significant remorse and repentance. He didn't just write once; he wrote twice. He wrote again in February 2023, pleading the case again. This was Senator Dean Smith from the opposition. So, whilst we hear a lot of this tough talk, on the other hand we have a senator, a member of the opposition leadership team, advocating for the release of a detainee, a child sex offender, in immigration detention, awaiting deportation. Senator Smith was arguing that that person should be released into the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a government that is trying to have it both ways. This is a government that is trying to be sensible, cautious and do what is necessary in order to be able to take actions to protect our community. This is not a government that is ignoring the High Court's decision. This is not a government that is ignoring the importance of the separation of powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, what we have to deal with and confront on a far-too-frequent basis is the Leader of the Opposition—a man with a heart of stone and a desperation for power—trying to absolutely use this opportunity to politically pointscore and create division and fear within our community at a time when we need to be thinking in a completely alternative way about social cohesion, building, caring and being careful with our words. The Leader of the Opposition has a lot to answer for, and the people that stand behind him and around him are answerable for that too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When discussing measures of this nature, which literally change the course of the way in which we run this country, it's important that we apply the appropriate diligence and that we do it in a way that is proportionate to the need to ensure that our community is safe, without the politicisation, the weaponisation, of something that is so deeply important to get right. We just ask that those opposite and the Leader of the Opposition start to demonstrate merit and absolute care in their choice of words instead of being fixated on trying to shore up his position as the stone-hearted man that is negative and determined to create division within our society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  As I rise to speak on the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill 2023, my thoughts are sitting squarely with the people of Indi who are doing it really tough and relying on government support. Here in this place and in the media, we are increasingly hearing about 'the cost-of-living crisis'. It's a phrase so overused it risks becoming just another political football used in this place to score points against the other side. But I know what the actual cost-of-living crisis is in my electorate of Indi and what it looks like. It looks like people increasingly calling on food shares and other charities to help put food on the table. It looks like people considering whether the cost of fuel is too high for their child to take on weekend sport and to drive them from town to town. It's looking for second jobs on top of existing jobs because making ends meet is getting more tricky each week. For those who rely on government payments such as JobSeeker, the disability support pension, student payments and the age pension, the decisions they must take and make as costs go up are so much harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my office we are experiencing an increase of people seeking help as they interact with Services Australia. As Australians we can be proud that we have such a safety net, but too often I hear from those who rely on Services Australia that the service they receive is not always adequate and the level of support offered through the payments provided is not enough to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. To be clear: the rate of JobSeeker is simply not enough. There have been times in our not-too-distant political history where it's been incredibly controversial for a member of this place to even acknowledge that payments such as JobSeeker are not adequate and that we must do more to support those who are looking for work. Too often the debate descended into unhelpful and demeaning slurs like 'dole bludger', 'leaners versus lifters' or 'welfare cheats'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where this bill and the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee has the potential to provide powerful cut-through and allow decisions on the rate of payments such as JobSeeker to be made based on evidence, not on political games. This committee was set up following an agreement between my Independent colleague Senator David Pocock and the government last year as part of negotiations on the industrial relations 'secure jobs, better pay' bill. The agreement to form this committee played a major role in my eventual decision to support that bill. The committee reported to the government before the last budget, but this bill formalises it in legislation. It will be known as the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. It will provide advice to the government ahead of each budget on economic inclusion and boosting participation, and on the adequacy and sustainability of income support payments. In preparing its reports, the committee must have regard to the government's economic and fiscal outlook and fiscal strategy. Its advice to the government is non-binding and it will consist of 14 part-time members, with appointments lasting three years. Members are to include economists, academics, union and business representatives and community advocates who will be appointed by the Minister for Social Services, in consultation with the Treasurer. There is much to commend in this bill, and I intend to vote in support of it. I welcome efforts to improve the evidence base for policy, particularly for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in this speech I spoke of the potential this idea has. While I welcome this bill, I am concerned that in many ways the government's proposal does not realise the true potential of this committee. This bill can be improved. The proposed membership of the committee has a major blind spot: among the economists, the academics, the union officials and business representatives, whose voice is missing? The voice of those who are actually experiencing poverty or who have experienced poverty. The voice of those who rely on government support payments and who face the often-uphill battle of interacting with Services Australia and making ends meet with those payments. The voice of single mothers, people living with disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Their experiences need to be heard alongside the expertise of economists and academics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an independent MP I am not guided by party ideology when making decisions on bills or forming policy decisions. I listen to those in my community who are most affected to truly understand how legislation would affect them and how it could be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Listening to people shouldn't be so revolutionary. It should be standard practice. This bill is a golden chance to seize that opportunity, but the government seems to be fumbling it. The Senate inquiry into this bill was undertaken in just over a month, with submissions from organisations such as the Australian Council of Social Services, Economic Justice Australia, UnitingCare Australia and others, making sensible suggestions on how this committee and its practice could be improved to get maximum impact. Suggestions have been made in good faith, and I note the Senate committee's report recommended four amendments to the bill. These include ensuring the committee's report is published at least two weeks before the budget is handed down and requiring the government to formally respond to the report. I also note and support the additional comments of Senator David Pocock regarding improving transparency and the independence of the committee, increasing the committee's scope to include developing national measures of poverty and also measures to end homelessness and increase diversity of membership of the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the member for North Sydney intends to move a series of amendments to the bill which would pick up the recommendations by the Australian Council of Social Services, and these amendments would address my concerns, including by requiring the government to include people with direct experience of poverty and for committee members to be remunerated for their work. I support these amendments. They are sensible amendments. They would improve this bill. They would improve the functioning of the committee and the quality of the advice given to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should take on recommendations made in good faith in the many submissions to the Senate inquiry. They would make this committee's function transparent, independent, inclusive and as robust as possible. If we're going to have a committee to advise government, let's make the best it can be. They would ensure that the voices of those who have experienced poverty are heard. It's so important; people who have lived experience have sensible solutions because they have a true understanding of the problems that a committee like this is trying to solve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this committee and its work will become a long-lasting, respected and trusted part of our parliamentary budget process. The potential is there. This bill should embed evidence in decision-making processes and therefore should make a substantive difference in the lives of people who rely on government support payments. I really encourage the government to think about these amendments and to take them on. I really am happy that this committee is being formed. It could be better. It can be better. We still have time to make it better. Ultimately, though, the principle of this is sound, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  In November last year the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. The committee was tasked with providing advice to government, ahead of every federal budget, on ways to boost economic inclusion and tackle disadvantage. As the Minister for Social Services has already advised the House, an interim committee comprised of a diverse range of experts has already commenced this important work, and this interim committee has delivered its first report, including advice on policy settings, systems and structures; and the adequacy, effectiveness, and sustainability of income support payments. This, importantly, really helps to inform the government's considerations out of the 2023-24 budget. I'm really pleased to be part of a government that is working every day to deliver on our positive agenda to boost economic inclusion and broaden opportunity for all Australians. The establishment now of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee as a statutory body is an important step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government will always work to support the most vulnerable in our society, tackle disadvantage and provide more opportunities to boost economic participation. We recognise the value of ensuring a broad range of views is considered in the design and development of policy. That's why this bill reflects the Albanese government's commitment to hear from experts, stakeholders and, significantly, the community. We on this side of the House know that disadvantage is a complex and systemic problem. That's why in our last budget we announced an overhaul of the way we as a government will seek to remove entrenched disadvantage. We are doing this by investing almost $200 million to deliver a comprehensive agenda to target investment in those communities doing it the toughest. The targeting entrenched disadvantage package, as the Minister for Social Services has previously stated, will better enable government to partner, to listen and to empower. We are partnering with philanthropy as well as listening to and empowering local leaders. I had the great pleasure of inviting the Treasurer to meet with local leaders who have championed targeted investment in their communities in Ashwood and Chadstone. The targeting entrenched disadvantage package will also allow us to work in a really direct way on the ground with communities to enable our services to be delivered in a way that meets their specific needs in a shared decision-making framework. We are listening to communities and making sure that we are empowering people within communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill establishes this committee as an independent statutory body. It will become a transparent mechanism for the future to provide expert advice to our government and to future governments on economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage in relation to policy settings, systems and structures. It will also look at the adequacy, effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments ahead of every federal budget. Announcing this committee is part of our agenda to boost economic inclusion and tackle disadvantage. This legislation seeks to fulfil our commitment to permanently legislate the committee and builds on arrangements that have been in place for the interim committee. Again, this reflects our commitment to really listen to experts, evidence, stakeholders and community views in all of the communities represented here in the parliament across the country to inform the decisions in each federal budget. This will ensure that we are receiving the very best advice on how to support Australians who need it most and how to minimise disadvantage across communities and tackle the entrenched disadvantage that we know exists in communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is allowing us to build upon the important work we as a government are already doing with the support that we have already provided to Australians to help with cost-of-living pressures. Our previous budget, the 2023-24 budget, announced a range of measures to support those on low incomes, including increasing the rates of working age and student payments. That's really targeted relief. We have also made an increase to Commonwealth rent assistance and expanded access to the single parenting payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that boosting economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage simply cannot be resolved in a single budget process or in a single portfolio. Doing this work requires sustained commitment over time and across government, something that this government is up for. This bill will ensure that there is a permanent mechanism to benefit from the independent expert advice that government receives on the ways it can better support Australians. Ultimately the mechanism will help facilitate and broaden opportunity as well as help reduce disadvantage in our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a practical level, the committee will consist of a chair and up to 13 members, comprising of economists, academics, union business representatives and community advocates. These members will be appointed by the Minister for Social Services, in consultation with the Treasurer. Members will hold office on a part-time basis for a period of three years and will be eligible for reappointment once their term ends. The committee will provide annual advice in a report to government on a range of matters, with a focus on economic inclusion and lifting participation, the adequacy and sustainability of income support payments and reducing barriers to economic participation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency is really important for our government. The findings of the committee will be published on the Department of Social Services website. The minister and Treasurer will jointly direct the committee to consider specific issues within its set remit, which will ensure that the government can seek advice on areas of priority. When the committee is considering matters, it must also have regard to the government's economic fiscal outlook and business strategy. Additionally, it will also have regard to existing policies and the long-term sustainability of the social security system. The committee will provide a report to government ahead of each federal budget, as I've previously mentioned, which the government may consider as part of the budget process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within five years from the commencement of the bill, the operation of the committee will be subject to independent review. That's to ensure that the committee is meeting its goals and objectives as set out in its legislated functions. The person or persons undertaking the review will provide a written report to the Minister for Social Services and the Treasurer within six months of the commencement of the review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important here to note that the establishment of the committee as a statutory body is another signal that our government is absolutely committed to providing support to Australians who need it most. This commitment to really listen to experts, stakeholders and community views, to inform decisions in the budget that affect the lives of everybody in this country while we're still acting in a fiscally responsible manner, is really meaningful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows for the minister and the Treasurer to jointly direct the committee to look at issues that are priorities and engage with communities in a really deep way. I'm really pleased to be part of a government that is making this commitment. We are funding this properly, so secretariat and research support will be provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advice that government receives will be non-binding. Our government will continue to make the decisions necessary to improve the lives of our citizens, because that's what we've been elected to this place to do. Our responsibility, which we take seriously, is to listen to the community and make the best decisions that the time demands. I'm pleased to support this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  Despite Australia being one of the richest countries in the world, over 3.3 million Australians are living in poverty. We pride ourselves on being a country of opportunity, fairness and equality, yet millions of people are struggling every day to put food on the table, to secure safe and affordable housing, to pay for medication and medical expenses, and to enjoy their life without constant financial stress. The eradication of poverty should be a national priority, yet successive governments have refused and failed to adequately measure, research and understand poverty and economic disadvantage in Australia. This has led to decades of inadequate income support payments and policies that served only to punish people in poverty and further entrench disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The permanent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee presents a real opportunity to address these issues and eradicate poverty in Australia. For the first time ever, we could have an independent body providing clear advice to the government on poverty reduction. This committee could mark the beginning of a government that actually works collaboratively with people living in poverty on issues that impact them. It could oversee the development of poverty measures and investigate specific issues that intersect and contribute to disadvantage, like lack of affordable housing and discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens see the enormous potential of the permanent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, and we're excited to see the bill for the committee's establishment introduced to the parliament. But this bill, the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill 2023, falls utterly short and is a complete slap in the face for advocates of the unemployed, for social service organisations and for every Australian living below the poverty line. Again and again, Labor has refused to listen and engage with people living in poverty on the policies that impact them, and this bill is no different. Nowhere in this bill is there mention of poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no requirement for someone with direct experience of poverty to be a part of the committee. For too long, governments have implemented policies that have failed to take into account the experiences and knowledge of people living in poverty. This has contributed to the development of harmful and destructive programs like robodebt, ParentsNext, and compulsory income management. If the government actually cared about economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage, this bill would include a requirement for somebody with direct experience of poverty to be a member of this committee. They would also have listened to the long list of academics, social services organisations and advocates for the unemployed who have calling for the development of a national poverty measure. Government after government have used the lack of a nationally accepted measure of poverty to dodge responsibility for the inadequacy of income support payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The permanent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee could play an integral role in developing a national definition of poverty, one that takes into account a diversity of needs and contexts and one that the government could be held accountable to. However, unsurprisingly, this bill fails to include any requirement for the committee to develop or use such a measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, the Australian Council of Social Service also raised concerns about the lack of transparency and independence of the committee. A key piece of work undertaken by the committee will be producing a report providing recommendations to the government. However, in its current form, the bill has no requirement for the government to respond to this report, and, further, it is unclear if and when the committee will publicly publish its full report. Additionally, the bill contains a provision that allows the government to direct the committee to investigate only certain topics and issues. This clearly infringes on the committee's independence and hampers its ability to fully investigate poverty and disadvantage. Concerns about the independence and transparency of the committee were also echoed by the Antipoverty Centre, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Salvation Army and many other submitters to the bill's inquiry. This bill clearly fails to meet the expectations of key advocacy organisations and will fail to deliver an independent and robust body to advise the government on economic inclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge and commend, though, the work of the interim Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. The interim committee's report, which was published in April, built upon the work of unemployment advocates, social service organisations and academics and contained important evidence about economic disadvantage in Australia. The report found that, apart from the temporary boost during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the JobSeeker payment has been declining relative to median incomes and other Centrelink payments for decades. It articulated what the Greens, people on income support and many others already knew: that the rate of JobSeeker is completely inadequate. The committee put forward a suite of important recommendations for the government to reduce economic inequality in Australia, but it made clear that the most pressing action was to raise the rate of JobSeeker and related working-age payments. In the report, the interim committee suggested that increasing the rate of payments to 90 per cent of the aged pension would improve their adequacy and reduce disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, in the last budget the government decided to raise the rate of JobSeeker by only $4 a day. Four dollars a day is not a substantial increase such as the interim committee recommended. Four dollars a day can't even buy you a coffee, let alone pay someone's ever-increasing rent, grocery bills and medical expenses. Poverty is a political choice, and the Labor government is choosing to keep millions of Australians on income support well below the poverty line. They are also choosing to put forward a completely inadequate framework for the permanent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there is enormous potential in this committee. The idea of an independent body to provide clear advice to parliament on this issue is something that the Greens have long advocated for. Earlier in the year, my colleague the Australian Greens spokesperson for social services, Senator Janet Rice, introduced the Greens' antipoverty commission bill into the Senate. This bill sought to establish an antipoverty commission to provide parliament with independent and transparent advice on the causes of poverty in Australia, on how to reduce it and on the minimum levels for social security payments. Unlike this lacklustre bill, our antipoverty commission would have had a number of distinct features we know are critical to establishing an effective independent body to tackle poverty and inequality in Australia. These included an explicit focus on addressing poverty in its name and framework, a clear requirement for the development of a national poverty line, a requirement for the government to publicly respond to recommendations made by the independent commission, a clear requirement for legislative reviews of income support payments and of the poverty line, an independent parliamentary committee that can scrutinise appointments to the independent body, and a focus on people experiencing poverty that enables people with direct experiences of disadvantage to be commissioners. This antipoverty commission would have responded to the work and the calls of unemployment advocates, academics and social security organisations about what is really needed to meaningfully address poverty in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Greens welcome the establishment of the permanent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, we know that this bill is not up to scratch. That is why I can foreshadow that my colleagues will be seeking to amend the bill in the Senate. We will be using our antipoverty commission framework in our deliberations, and we encourage others in parliament to do so. As the cost of living continues to soar, we must do everything in our power to ensure communities are kept out of poverty and out of financial distress. The permanent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee presents a real opportunity for change, and the Greens will fight to ensure that this opportunity is not squandered and that we have the best chance at truly eradicating poverty in Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  Tonight, across Australia, there will be half-a-million households who won't be able to put enough food on their table. Over the past year, 1.2 million Australian kids have gone hungry. Right now, 3.3 million people are struggling to pay their bills, living below the poverty line in Australia. More and more Australians are just one big medical problem, a couple of missed shifts or another interest rate rise away from complete disaster, yet the big banks brag about record profits, Coles and Woolies have profiteered to the tune of billions, and coal and gas companies pay nothing in tax. There have been 13 consecutive interest rate hikes since I became an MP in this House in May 2022. Rents have spiked and spiked again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've chatted to so many locals in Ryan going through absolute hell to try to just get through each day in these tough times. Parents are having to make the completely cruel choice between sending their kids to Saturday soccer and the mortgage payment. People are skipping meals to pay the rent or are simply unable to pay for much needed medication or health care, because Medicare has been gutted too. And where's the safety net? Where's the support when times are tough?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's this government's response? Raise JobSeeker to above the poverty line, raise the pension, built hundreds of thousands of public homes, crackdown on price gouging? No! It's a new committee! Labor's bill doesn't even include a national definition of poverty, effectively allowing the government to keep its head firmly buried in the sand about the scale of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Council of Social Services has also raised concerns around the lack of transparency and independence of the permanent committee. Can it be truly independent if, as this bill allows, the government has ultimate control over what the committee investigates and what the committee reports on? And now, get this, because frankly it's laughable: nowhere in the bill is there a requirement for the committee to have representation from everyday people, people with direct experience of poverty. It's an inclusionary committee without inclusion—but there is room for the chair of the Business Council of Australia! And, if the committee dares to say something that might actually address the problem? Again, I think my constituents back in Ryan are probably a little sceptical that it will actually be listened to, and with good reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Credit where it's due, ahead of the federal budget earlier this year the interim committee released a report which had some very good recommendations, and most important is this one:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government commit to a substantial increase in the base rates of JobSeeker Payment and related working age payments as a first priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's sensible stuff, but what was Labor's response? To raise JobSeeker by $4 a day! Is that a substantial increase? For those who end up listening to this speech on YouTube, drop me a comment about whether you think this counts as a substantial increase. Four dollars—it's actually insulting to people who have fallen on hard times, absolutely insulting. It's a genuine kick in the guts from this government that many hoped when they were elected would actually do something. Four dollars—that's not even a coffee in many places now. That's not even a loaf of bread from Brumbies these days. It's so offensive. Labor's not going to raise the rate of JobSeeker so people have something to fall back on, so they can find their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about mutual obligations? Anyone who has dealt with Services Australia knows what a rort it is with the hoops people have to jump through just to stay in the system. It's an incredible grift for private service providers and genuine stress, anxiety and misery for people who just need a little bit of help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last financial year, almost two million payments were suspended. Over half were because people could not meet their mutual obligations. We've met so many people in Ryan who've been through this horrendous and punitive process. Often people are kicked off payments because of a technical error, and we hear time and time again, in the electorate office, just how frustrating it is taking the time off work to wait in hours-long queues to fix a mistake they didn't even make. It is a hostile system. It's a punitive system. As I said, it's absolutely designed to be frustrating and demeaning, and Labor apparently won't touch it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where's the Commonwealth Employment Service we used to have in this country? Where's the vision for finding appropriate work for people, not just punishing them? Take away the safety net of an income support payment, and workers are scared. Workers are scared of losing their jobs, they're scared of losing their houses, and it seems the Labor government is very happy for them to feel scared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months back, property mogul Tim Gurner was, rightly, absolutely ridiculed for his comments on the economy. He said he wanted to see 'pain in the economy' and an increase in unemployment. Unemployment is at almost four per cent, and that's only the official figure. We know it could actually be much higher. There is so much pain already. Australians are struggling. At the time of those comments, most people were justifiably outraged, but Gurner was pretty much just stating what the entire corporate and political farce, the corporate and political gang, actually thinks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, said in a recent speech that the Reserve Bank wants to soften labour market conditions. That's technocrat code for increasing unemployment—kicking people out of work so that they'll accept lower wages and harsher work conditions. This is Reserve Bank and Labor government policy while they refuse to intervene. They will happily ignore the price-gouging corporations and blame inflation on workers and wages. They'll hide behind their interest rate hikes and their failing committees, but, at the end of the day, they want workers scared of unemployment. Scared workers are compliant, and compliant workers are easy to exploit. Come on; is this the Australia we want?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  Despite being one of the richest countries in the world, over 3.3 million people in this country are living in poverty. In a wealthy country like ours, no-one should be living in poverty and everyone should have an affordable roof over their head. Instead we are gripped by an inequality crisis that is driving the cost-of-living crisis in this country and that is seeing corporations make record profits while people have to sleep in tents because of Labor's rental crisis, where they're backing unlimited rent rises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, none of that is addressed in this bill, the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill 2023. I'll come back to talk about the bill in a moment. But one thing is crystal clear about economic inclusion that the government just refuses to accept: there's a crisis in this country. Everything is going up except wages. No-one has any confidence that the politicians will do anything to look after people. Labor and Liberal aren't just complicit; they're responsible. They're in charge. They have caused this. Thanks to their housing policies, more people are now living in tents. Thanks to their lack of regulation of the big supermarkets, people are going hungry. Thanks to their failure to stop price gouging in the energy markets, people can't afford to keep the lights on. People can't afford to fill up their car with fuel. We're being smashed with higher prices while Labor and Liberal take millions in corporate donations each year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone knows why we have a cost-of-living crisis: big corporations making massive profits. They have too much power and they get to write the rules. The politicians from Labor and the Liberals can't even name the cause of the crisis. In the last quarter, the Commonwealth bank made $2.5 billion. That must be nice. In the last year, NAB, the bank, made $7.7 billion, and ANZ made $7.4 billion. That must be very nice. They made this off the back of higher interest rates and higher rents, and they're backed by politicians from Liberal and Labor. Shell made $4 billion off higher fuel prices. Qantas made $2.4 billion after the government gave them millions of dollars of your money. In the middle of an energy crisis, Origin made $1.1 billion. Every single one of these corporations donated to the Liberal and Labor parties. All of them have regular meetings with the politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to put people first, not the corporations. The big corporations are doing just fine. It is time to end the special treatment, cap prices and make these corporations pay their fair share of profits. All of that is what will drive economic inclusion in this country. If we want to have a fairer society, in a time when corporations are making massive profits and everyone else is doing it tough, and the government has to form a committee to go and get advice to say, 'Can you tell us what the problem is?'—well, people know what is going on: big corporations are robbing everyone blind. You can see it in your power bills. You can see it when you go to the supermarkets. What they expect politicians to do is rein in the big corporations, make them pay their fair share of tax, stop them gouging prices and use that money to make people's lives better and do things like get dental into Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank governor had the gall to say that it is everyday people getting haircuts and going to the dentist that's driving inflation. Well, here's a tip: if going to the dentist is too expensive, why don't we make the big corporations pay more tax and use that money to get dental into Medicare and give everyone a bit of everyday relief? But, no, Labor won't do that. They'll set up a committee, ask for advice and then just completely ignore it like they did last time. The committee came back to them and said: 'There's a lot of people in this country doing it tough, and we need to lift people out of poverty. And you know what? We could afford it. Make the big corporations pay their fair share of tax, and you could afford it.' Did Labor listen to that? No. Labor left people in poverty. Meanwhile, the corporations make record profit after record profit, and the price of everything goes up and up and up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the housing crisis has never been worse. We have rents going up several times faster than wages. What did Labor do? They came together and got all the premiers and the Prime Minister together, and they said that Labor's position is to back unlimited rent rises. So Labor just signed off on saying that a landlord can put up the rent as much as they like, even if it means you can't afford it, and they're not going to do anything about it. That's Labor's position. Then they set up a committee and said, 'Can you advise us on what the problem is?' We know what the problem is: rents are out of control, supermarket prices are out of control, electricity bills are out of control and the corporations are making record profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stop the profiteering. Stop the price gouging. Use your power as a government to freeze rents, freeze mortgage rates and stop everyday people being asked to suffer and be cannon fodder in the war on inflation. There's a different way to tackle the war on inflation, and that is to make the big corporations pay their fair share of tax, stop them price gouging and use that money to fund services like getting dental into Medicare or wiping student debt or making public school genuinely free. That's how you deliver cost of living and tackle inflation. But, no, Labor is leaving all the heavy lifting up to the RBA. As a result, the RBA say, 'Oh, the problem is that you're going to get a haircut and you're going to the dentist,' and they put up rates even more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pushing people to the brink. People have had enough. People can't afford more mortgage rises and more rent rises and higher costs at the supermarket, but Labor says that that's fine. It is no wonder that at the last election Labor's vote went backwards. It's no wonder we have a situation where less than a third of the country votes for the government, a bit more than a third of the country votes for the opposition and a third is now voting for someone else, because it is only people like the Greens in parliament who are going to take on the big corporations that are driving this cost-of-living crisis, make them pay their fair share of tax, stop the price gouging, freeze mortgage rates, freeze rents and tackle the cost-of-living crisis and the inflation crisis that way. It's no wonder there is a growing disconnect and that people are getting turned off politics. They voted for a change of government in the hope that the government would do something to tackle the situation people found themselves in, but they look at the politicians in power just saying, 'Yes, keep hiking the rents, keep hiking the mortgage rates, put up supermarket prices as much as you want,' and doing absolutely nothing about it. It is no wonder that people are getting disconnected, because they see that, if you give them power, the politicians don't do anything about it; they just keep taking donations from them all.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BANDT:</span>
                    </a>  Labor interjects and says they love that, and it's great, and they ask what the plan is. Well, the plan is: make the big corporations pay their fair share of tax; stop the price gouging; freeze rents; make them pay their fair share of tax; put dental into Medicare; wipe student debt; and make public school genuinely free. You could do it all if you had the guts to stand up to the big corporations instead of taking their donations. That's the plan, Labor. That's the plan. And the fact that you're not doing it—you scratch your head and you wonder why people are abandoning the big parties at a rate of knots—well, that's why. It's because you are just doing what the big corporations say and you're leaving people out to dry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other critical matters when it comes to economic inclusion is that you see the consequences of economic inclusion, you see how far the system is under stress, when it comes to the people who are the most vulnerable and you see how they are being treated. Where a lot of these things intersect—the failure to have rates of income support to lift people out of poverty, the failure to build enough public housing and the failure to regulate rents so that everyone can afford to live in those houses—is where the economic impacts of that play out, particularly when it comes to people, particularly women, who are fleeing family and domestic violence. Six women have been murdered in just one week, five of them by men they knew. Men's violence is an epidemic, and it's time the government policies reflected this urgency to tackle violence against women and their children. First Nations women, women from culturally diverse backgrounds, women in regional areas, older women, LGBTIQ+ people, and women with a disability are even more likely to experience violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Saturday 25 November was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Every year on this day we recommit to ending sexual and physical violence against women around the world. But frontline services are still underfunded, and women and children are being turned away as a result. Enough with the empty promises. Enough with ignoring the impact of financial insecurity and housing stress on women's capacity to leave. Enough with underfunding the services that women reach out to in a crisis. The government has said that it wants to end violence against women within a generation, and that is a very welcome goal. But it's not stumping up the funds to deliver that. The total federal funding commitment over the next five years is $2.23 billion—less than half of the $5 billion the sector needs to ensure that no-one is turned away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have spoken often about the difficult choices in the lead-up to the budget, but right now they're choosing to spend $313 billion on tax cuts for politicians and billionaires while baulking at $1 billion a year for women who are escaping violence. The housing crisis is felt even more acutely by women and children who are experiencing family and domestic violence. Often women are forced to choose between abuse and homelessness, because there's nowhere else to go. Women who are on low wages or income support are especially vulnerable without the resources to escape violent situations. Yet this government persists with the cruelty of keeping income support payments like JobSeeker below the poverty line and has the audacity to cry poor while dishing out hundreds of billions in tax cuts and investment property perks for the rich.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today and every day for the next 16 days the Greens are calling for full funding of frontline DV services. The women's safety sector has repeatedly called for $1 billion a year of investment to meet demand. Labor's last budget provided less than half of that amount for frontline services. Women deserve better than that, and $1 billion each year is a very small price to pay to help end the ongoing epidemic of violence against women and children.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  Well, it's another interesting day for us here in the House of Representatives, where we're debating a bill for an act to legislate a committee that already exists—and the committee that already exists is also already not being listened to by the government that's now legislating it. The Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee was formed in November 2022, and it provided some advice to the government as part of the budget process earlier this year. The central recommendation was that JobSeeker and other support payments be paid at a rate linked to the pension—the key recommendation of this committee was about 90 per cent of the pension payment. Of course, the government didn't accept that recommendation, haven't implemented it and have not indicated in any way that they intend to implement it. I don't call for them to implement that recommendation. I think it's insulting to say to pensioners that there's a link between you and unemployment benefits. Pension payments are completely separate and unrelated to the social safety net of the unemployment benefit system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know about this committee that we're talking about legislating right now is that the one thing they've ever done the government agree with. We're in a farcical situation—another episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Y</span><span style="font-style:italic;">es</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Minister</span>—where a committee that the government isn't listening to as it stands is going to be permanently enshrined in legislation so the government can keep not listening to them year after year into the future permanently if the bill passes. We don't support this bill on the side of the chamber, and I couldn't really ascertain from the Greens leader what their position is on the bill. He certainly hammered the principle of having the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, so I suppose they're not supporting it and therefore it's never going to happen, because, if they're voting against it, it won't pass the Senate. But maybe they are voting for it despite that contribution that was just made. We'll find out when we vote on this bill in this place and in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, we don't support this completely unnecessary additional quango-type bureaucracy being enshrined in legislation. We know we've got Jenny Macklin, the former member for Jagajaga, as the chair of this Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, union officials on it et cetera, because apparently, according to this government, those are the people we need to listen to about economic inclusion. Why do we need to listen to a former member of this parliament when we could listen to current members of this parliament? What is the point of this parliament? If we're not the House of Representatives, what are we? Here's a novel idea: if you want to know about economic inclusion, why don't you divide the country up into 150 sections; call them, maybe, electorates; hold a democratic process to elect representatives from each of those parts of the country; and have them all come together on a regular basis and talk about challenges that the country is facing and solutions to those challenges based on those 151 people, knowing the electorates they represent, bringing those perspectives together and passing legislation to make this country a better place? That sounds a whole lot like the House of Representatives that I'm standing in right now. It sounds like we've already got the expertise and the capability to bring community representation perspectives together, have debates and talk about how we can address all the varied challenges that are facing this country. Instead, this government wants to outsource that to a former member of this chamber, some other handpicked union officials—well remunerated, no doubt, and good luck to them. They're very good, these union officials, at being well remunerated from appointments to Labor government boards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got this situation because of a deal that was done in the Senate with Senator Pocock: the bad idea that the government didn't even listen to when they had the chance earlier in the year, when it reported its one big idea, which was a 90 per cent link to the pension for JobSeeker payments. The government formed this committee, heard what they had to say, said, 'We're not interested in that advice,' and now we've got them saying, 'And we want to continue to not listen to and not implement that advice we're not interested in, in perpetuity, through a legislated protection of that function.' We've now got a situation where the government is implementing not only their own bad ideas but also other people's bad ideas. We've got Senator Pocock's bad idea being implemented by this government as part of some deal that was done in the Senate to get his support for something else. It's completely ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government doesn't understand through its own experience, through representing its own communities, about economic inclusion in our economy, then it should move aside. Step out of the way. You're not fit to be in government if you need to outsource that fundamental connection with community to someone else. And with the people you've chosen, you don't even like what they've got to say because you're not listening to the suggestions they're making for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't support this bill. It's not even the government's own policy or idea; it's part of a deal they've done in the Senate. We've just heard the Greens smash and slam the whole concept, so we're assuming they are going to honour the word of their leader just now on how pointless this is and vote against this—so it therefore won't pass the Senate. We are spending one of the precious few days we've got left before the government goes off to the Christmas break early—and we're only going to be sitting 17 weeks next year—debating a bill to permanently legislate a committee that it's currently not listening to, so it can not listen to them into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day there are a lot of things this parliament could be doing that would improve the lives of Australians. Passing this bill is not one of them, and I urge the House not to support the second reading.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I'd like to thank all members who have participated in what has been a wide-ranging debate on the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill 2023. The bill reflects the Albanese Labor government's commitment to support the most vulnerable in our society, tackle disadvantage and provide more opportunities to boost economic participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our first two budgets we have laid the groundwork for supporting vulnerable people in our society and our community, and that work continues. We want to hear from experts, stakeholders and community as we recognise the value of ensuring that a broad range of views are considered in the design and development of policy. We know that disadvantage is complex and is a systematic problem. We can't resolve this in a single budget process or indeed in a single portfolio; it requires sustained commitment over time and across government. This bill ensures there is an enduring mechanism for the government to benefit from independent expert advice on ways to support Australians in need, broaden opportunity and reduce disadvantage in our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill outlines the functions of the permanent committee, including the scope of its advice and reporting arrangements. It also outlines matters of membership, including appointments, and provides for an independent review of the committee and the act to be undertaken every five years. In the meantime, the interim committee has already provided its first report, including advice on policy setting systems, structures and adequacy effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments, which helped inform the government's consideration ahead of the 2023-24 budget. I acknowledge that the member for North Sydney and the member for Clark have circulated detailed amendments calling for changes to the bill, and we will deal with those amendments in consideration in detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about putting mechanisms in place for independent advice. I understand the opposition will be opposing this. It's not surprising that they don't want to hear independent advice. It wasn't what they were known for best when they were last in government—taking advice from experts or carefully considered policy. Many of the decisions of the former government could be only characterised as keeping themselves in power. Well, our government does things very differently. We make sure that we are listening, that we bring people in to get that independent advice. We are not afraid, like those opposite might be, to seek advice from experts, to have contested ideas and different perspectives brought together. This is what good decision-making looks like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very keen for this bill to be passed. It is an important contribution to the many significant mechanisms our government has in place to ensure that different perspectives are brought to the table. Of course, addressing disadvantage and boosting economic participation has been a significant focus for the government, whether it is through the establishment of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, through our white paper, through the numerous pieces of legislation that we have put in place, through our boosts to rent assistance and income support, or through our extension of the single-mother parenting payment and paid parental leave—and the list goes on and on and on. Our government is very proud of boosting economic inclusion and economic participation. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment seeks to highlight a couple of things. Of course we're going to support the bill, but we really need to make some things clear. There are a number of people in this chamber who will come into the House on every single occasion and speak very passionately about why they believe 26 weeks of paid parental leave is such a worthy cause, both from an economic perspective and from a fairness perspective, and many of them are the same people who opposed the coalition's 26 weeks of paid parental leave, which, again, we took to two elections and on which we received a mandate when we were elected in 2013. They argued against it, presumably because it wasn't their idea. So now we find that 10 years later—in fact, it will be 12 years later—we'll get to 26 weeks of paid parental leave. Those who just a few short years ago did not support paid parental leave of 26 weeks include a minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's huge hypocrisy, and I think Australians recall the very vociferous opposition to 26 weeks of paid parental leave from the Labor Party at that time. Most Australians won't be particularly surprised by the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and their attempts to be wreckers while in opposition. Now they are seeking to atone, I suspect, for that opposition that they—in, I think, an unprincipled way—went forward with while in opposition. We won't adopt a similar unprincipled position. I have always supported 26 weeks of paid parental leave myself, and obviously our party has, so we will support this bill notwithstanding the concerns we have with some particular aspects of the scheme. Most notably, as I outlined in my amendment to the second reading of the bill, in essence there are certain payments—depending on what an employee adopts as their favoured mechanism of receiving paid parental leave—that require small businesses to administer and pay the paid parental leave, as opposed to Services Australia, which would be the customary thing to do. I don't think it's beyond the ability of the government to amend the legislation and to say to small businesses—quite frankly, small businesses that are struggling under a Labor economy, struggling under an economically restrictive environment imposed on them by a Labor government: 'We will make this minor amendment to ensure that this isn't an additional burden placed on you.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that's wholly consistent with the view that we want, to the greatest extent possible, to maintain a relationship between an employee and their employer during a period of leave, however they choose to take that—whether they take that as a single period or whether they take it over a period of time—and, indeed, for partner pay as well. The best way to facilitate that relationship is to make it as easy as possible for small businesses. I think there's a general principle on this side of the chamber that we believe that, where a government imposes a duty on, particularly, a small business, it should do everything it possibly can to ensure that that small business is not required to pick up additional regulatory impost. That's what will happen here. So we again call on the minister to do some of that work. That work should have already been done, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the small business sector, throughout this process, made clear their reservations with respect to this aspect of the bill. We were quite surprised, I must say, that the government didn't seek to amend that, to place the obligation on the government, through Services Australia, to administer those payments, as opposed to transferring that requirement onto small businesses. It's quite remarkable that the government wouldn't have listened through that consultation. It begs the question: why on earth would you consult small businesses for their views on these measures and then entirely ignore what they've said to you? It's a bit like the bill we were just debating. If you ask for that consultation or advice—I think most Australians would agree—it's reasonable for a small business to say, 'You're imposing an additional impost on us.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless they, as small businesses, elect to make those payments directly themselves, our amendment requests the government to ensure that they don't have to do that. We think the amendment spells out, clearly, best practice here. Give small businesses an opportunity to be the pay clerk if they want to, but, if it's a burden that they cannot wear in a reasonable way, then it should become the primary obligation of the government, through Services Australia, to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we're quite surprised that they haven't listened. I've got in front of me the submission from the Motor Trades Association of Australia. The MTAA submission noted: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…the current (and future) impost on small business employers to act as the administrative payment intermediary between the Commonwealth and new parent employees is unwarranted and disproportionately adversely impacts smaller businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told by the MTAA that, for the 246 businesses which completed their survey, it added to the payroll processing time for nearly 91 per cent of respondents, increased the administrative burden on business for about 92 per cent and—this is probably the most concerning aspect in this economic environment—created cashflow problems for nearly a third, or 32.1 per cent, of respondents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, at a time when we have—let's be frank—a Labor economy and a Labor minister and government in a way that ensures that we have more sluggish growth and higher inflation and we are seeing insolvencies and liquidations creeping higher and higher, the government has brought forward a bill that will create cashflow problems for nearly one-third of all members of the Motor Trades Association who participated in this survey. Then, having been given that evidence, they've wilfully ignored it and proceeded without changing their proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a remarkably difficult thing to do. If we had a government that cared about small businesses and the families that are generally the backbone of those small businesses, it would make this change. It is absolutely reasonable for the small businesses to have made that recommendation. The National Electrical and Communications Association made very clear, through their members, that they'd prefer Services Australia to pay PPL directly to all staff members. In its submission to the inquiry, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For many small and family businesses, the costs associated with administering the scheme are magnified as they do not have the existing organisational capability or internal expertise to implement complex processes. Allowing small businesses to 'opt-in' to administering the scheme or have Services Australia administer the payment directly to the employee will reduce the disproportionate regulatory burden on the sector, while allowing businesses to administer the scheme if they prefer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What on earth is controversial about that? Why on earth would the minister ignore that? Do some work. I know it's inconvenient. I know it's difficult sometimes when you get advice that you don't like, when you have dragged your feet a bit and you don't really want to have to change something and all the processes that go along with it, but Australian businesses will suffer as a result. The overwhelmingly good objective of delivering 26 weeks of paid parental leave albeit staggered over a period of time does not of itself absolve the government of its responsibility to implement those changes in a way that makes it as easy as possible for small businesses to cope and, indeed, through their own stated objective, to facilitate a relationship between an employer and an employee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that, when you have the Motor Trades Association, who are one of many of the organisations that represent stereotypical mum-and-dad small businesses, come out and so clearly and reasonably articulate to the government what the limitations are on their proposal and, importantly, don't just come along with a complaint or an axe to grind but actually then suggest what an administrative fix could be, for the government to ignore that is pretty extraordinary. I think it says a lot about this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people have suspicions about Labor governments essentially working through the wish list of their union paymasters and not having much consideration for small businesses, but, even so, moments like this are still pretty surprising, because this is not controversial. Again, having nearly 92 per cent of respondents tell the government that it will increase processing times and be an administrative burden on their business and a third of businesses saying that it will create cashflow problems for them should on its own should have been enough for the minister to do some extra work and get the bill right. It's not a huge burden on Services Australia to administer these payments under the scheme as they administer other payments. It's being imposed by the government—quite rightly; it's good policy—so why on earth would you impose that on a small business that's not capable of administering it? In fact, it runs counter to the stated objective of trying to bring employers and employees in these circumstances closer together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government change this when it gets to the Senate, we'll give them credit for finally listening to the feedback that's been given to them. Why on earth ask for feedback from small businesses then ignore it when they come back with something that's eminently sensible? Is that a discussion that goes on in the minister's office, where the minister gets the advisers around the room and they just say: 'No. It's all in the too-hard basket. Let's just keep ploughing on with what we've got. We can't be bothered. We can't be stuffed changing this. It's just a few small businesses that are going to suffer'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it pretty extraordinary that this didn't change. Our full expectation, following that feedback and how overwhelming it was, was that the government would come back and include that quite minor administrative fix to alleviate those potential problems for small businesses. The fact that they haven't done so, sadly, says a lot about the way in which this government seeks advice and ignores it. I'm not sure if that's pigheadedness, inertia or just being slack. I'm not sure which of them it is, but in any event you have circumstances where Australians suffer. Here we'll have small businesses suffering. Small businesses are overwhelmingly family businesses, people who pay the rent first, staff second, tax third and themselves last. Now further obligations are being imposed on them, under this PPL amendment bill, to be the pay clerk for employees in certain circumstances where, in the ordinary course of events, Services Australia would be administering these payments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inconvenient though it may be at times for the government, we in the coalition will always stand up for small businesses: the people who by and large, other than through some large representative groups, don't have the ability to come and stalk the halls here and knock on ministers' doors and seek an audience with a minister to put their case, like many of the large unions do. These are small business who just rely on their local representatives to do the right thing by them. Sadly, in this instance, their local representatives on the government benches have completely ignored them by refusing to make some very minor changes to this bill that would have been consistent with the feedback they received. For that reason, I've moved the amendment, and I again call on the government to see some common sense at the eleventh hour. We'll give you credit for finally listening if you do. I know it will be a bit of extra work, but—let's be frank—there's not a huge amount on the plate of the government, with a fairly thin legislative agenda. So do some extra work and help our small businesses, as opposed to asking for their advice and completely ignoring them.</span>

It's funny that I have to make this speech after that presentation by the member for Deakin, bizarre speech that it was. It sounded like there was an ambulance circling Parliament House; it just wailed on and on for nearly 18 minutes. It was unbelievable.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that the minister has put forward will implement the second tranche of the Albanese government's paid parental leave reform. It is great Labor policy, something to be proud of, a reform that is vital for families, vital for women and vital for the economy—three things that were ignored by the shadow minister, the member for Deakin. Paid parental leave is a cornerstone of Labor policy, and the Albanese government will always ensure that Aussie families get the support they deserve. The continued investment in and expansion of paid parental leave represents a commitment made and fulfilled by the Albanese government. It is a commitment to families, a commitment to the future of young Australians and a commitment to increasing gender equality, something that is good for productivity. This bill builds on our record of supporting Aussie families and is critical to increasing our productivity and fostering a modern Australia. Investing in paid parental leave benefits our economy, and we know that when it's done right it can advance gender equality.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends the Paid Parental Leave scheme from 20 to 26 weeks, giving more support to parents at a vital stage of life. This bill also increases the reservation period for the dad or partner from two to four weeks and doubles the period where parents can take simultaneous leave from two to four weeks. These additions make it easier for partners to take a larger role in the caring responsibilities and for families to have more flexibility in their caring situation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to modernising our policy and ensuring that the system of paid parental leave is equitable and, most importantly, useful. Starting from 1 July next year, two additional weeks of leave will be added each year, reaching up to 26 weeks in 2026. The increases in total amount of paid leave and the amount that can be taken simultaneously provide critical additional support to mums after childbirth and allow for far more flexibility when it comes to divvying up the caring responsibilities. The increase in the reservation period from two to four weeks allows for partners to take a more active role in child care. Single parents will have access to the full 26 weeks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Albanese government bill not only gives support to dual-parent household; it also helps single parents by allowing them to take that full amount of leave. Single parents have a tough job raising a family and financially supporting them at the same time, so it's vital that we ensure that they have as much help as possible.</span>

                    </a>  I take that 'hear, hear' from the minister at the desk. As the son of a single mother of 10 children—I don't think she would have had paid parental leave!—I can say that as much support as possible is needed in modern Australia. Supporting families in their care responsibilities and helping them to balance care effectively is key to ensuring women's long-term economic equality. The Albanese government is committed to helping give women more flexibility in child care and to making sure that they don't have to choose between having a child and having a career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When fathers take a greater caring role from the start, it benefits mums, dads and their kids, hopefully—my sons, Stan and Leo, just gloss over that fact! This bill sends a clear message that treating parenting as an equal partnership supports gender equality. The Albanese government values men as carers too, and we want to see that reinforced in workplaces and our communities right across Australia. We're committed to helping create a system which supports modern Australian families. This scheme is flexible, fair and drives positive health, social and economic outcomes for both parents and their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave is also vital to ensuring the health and wellbeing of parents. Increasing the amount of leave that can be taken simultaneously from two weeks to four weeks means that parents can support each other through the stages of early parenthood without needing to incur extra financial hardship. With the rising cost of living, paid parental leave enables families to have that little bit of flexibility in distributing the role of caring and helps to ease the financial strain of child care. This is the largest investment in Paid Parental Leave since Labor established it back in 2011, and it will benefit over 180,000 families each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor governments have always been the ones who stick up for families. We've implemented cheaper child care, better paid parental leave and helped more families to buy a home. This is all part of the Albanese government's plan to ensure a better future for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously children and young families are the future of Australia—that's plain and simple. So it's vital that we make sure that children have the best possible start in life. That is a wise investment. Increasing paid parental leave is so important because it enables parents to give their child the care that they need and will mean better outcomes for both children and parents. The Paid Parental Leave scheme makes it easier for both partners to share the childcare responsibilities and, according to the Women’s Economic Equality Taskforce, is one of the best ways to advance women's economic equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government will always look for ways to further gender equality, and these changes will benefit not only women but obviously all Australians. Paid parental leave also creates more flexibility for employers, with parents able to return to work earlier and balance work and care more effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More flexibility for families creates a more flexible and versatile economy, which is a good thing. It benefits all Australians. It makes it easier for women to participate in the workforce, and I'm sure both sides of the chamber would see that being a sound economic policy and a key component of building a modern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt and Anna, a couple in my electorate of Moreton, have told me of the benefit that paid parental leave gives to their family. They said: 'The Paid Parental Leave scheme is of huge benefit to working families. It gave us the ability to take time off at a vital stage of life and gave us the option of flexibility. The scheme is vital for ensuring that women have the option of returning to work if they choose. Children also get the benefit of developing a strong bond with both parents from an early age.' Thank you to Matt and Anna. This is a story that would be echoed by many families across Australia and demonstrates how important it is that we keep supporting parents and children, especially at such an early age. Giving people the option of flexibility and the stability of 26-weeks leave means that having a child does not have to become a complex financial decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one of my constituents stated, 'This is an area I'm passionate about, and I'm glad it's finally receiving attention from the government.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the largest investment in Paid Parental Leave since Labor established it back in 2011 and goes to show how important it is to maintain these strong institutions. The continual advances in Paid Parental Leave and the focus on cheaper child care demonstrates just how committed we are to ensuring that families across Australia have a strong network of support from government. Raising children is a tough job. It's important that children have a strong support system, especially in those early years. Labor governments are committed to making sure that all families have equitable access to government support and that parents have the opportunity to take leave at that vital stage of life for their child, which is the hours best spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion of Paid Parental Leave is a commitment put forward in the October budget, and it's great to see it being enacted in legislation. It was the centrepiece of Labor's first budget, where we invested half-a-billion dollars to expand the scheme to six months by 2026, and now the Albanese government obviously does more than just talk about such change—we make commitments, and we enact them. That's what sensible governments do. You make that promise and you stick to it. The implementing and maintaining of Paid Parental Leave is critical in maintaining a modern Australia. Paid parental leave gives women more flexibility in their caring role and gives children the vital care they need at such a young age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In another life, I was a school teacher, and there's a lot of evidence that shows if you can invest in young kids as much as possible that time and attention and support all pays off in primary school and then in high school, so this bill makes it easier for both partners to be active in child care and encourages a more equitable arrangement for families. This bill honours our commitment to Australian families by delivering a policy that is flexible, fair, drives positive health, and social and economic outcomes. I stress again: it has economic outcomes for both parents and their children. It goes to the heart of what Labor governments are about—giving people the support to grow and looking after families to foster a modern Australia. The bill before the House is good for parents, good for kids, good for employers and good for the economy. I recommend that to the House and totally discount the amendment put forward by the member for Deakin—I do not recommend that at all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I rise to speak to the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023. Paid parental leave is an issue I care very much about, and I've been pushing for this government and the previous government to do much more. It's an issue that affects many people around the country, including my constituents. I'm glad to see that some progress has finally been made in extending the Paid Parental Leave scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economics behind paid parental leave speak for themselves. Equity Economics has estimated that the cumulative impact of proposed changes to expand paid parental leave could increase GDP by 4.1 per cent, or some $166 billion, by 2050. If Australia could lift female participation to that of men, it would increase GDP by 8.7 per cent, or some $353 billion, by 2050. Further modelling by Equity Economics shows that if an average Australian woman had the same rate of workforce participation after having children as that of a woman in Sweden, for example, she would earn an additional $696,000 over her working life and retire with an extra $180,000 in superannuation. Those are pretty stark statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research by the Grattan Institute shows that shared paid parental leave boosts mothers' earnings and boosts our entire national GDP. Grattan modelling suggests that increasing the entitlement to 26 weeks shared between parents would cost the government some $600 million per year but add $900 million to GDP per year as well as boost mothers' lifetime earnings by $30,000. So not only does this make sense, but it is also very good for children. But it is important in this context because so many barriers have gotten in the way of gender equity and equal economic participation for men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So expanding paid parental leave just makes sense, and that's exactly what this bill does. It expands parental leave, albeit in phases. It is very gradual, from 20 to 26 weeks by July 2026. My concern is that we will have another federal election before that. If this is not bipartisan and supported by the opposition, there will be the fear that they will repeal or wind back some of this progress, despite the fact that it is good economics, good for productivity, good for equality, good for women's economic security, good for Australian society and, of course, good for the families and new babies themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, a working family can access up to 20 weeks of government funded paid parental leave. Shared care is encouraged. Two weeks are reserved for each parent, and they must use or lose those two weeks. This leaves 16 weeks for parents to share however they choose. By 1 July 2026, some 2½ years away, the scheme will be 26 weeks long, where four weeks are reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis. That will leave 18 weeks that parents can choose to share however they wish. For instance, a couple may decide to share leave equally and take 13 weeks each. Meanwhile, single parents will have access to the full 26-week entitlement. Coupled parents will also be able to take up to four weeks of paid parental leave at the same time, whereas currently parents can only take up to two weeks together. It's important to note that being able to take up to four weeks enables parents to take parental leave together, and that has positive effects on maternal recovery. It's a clear step in the right direction, but it's clear that more can be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is ongoing frustration with the pace of change. Whilst the government can be commended for finally acting on this, it is still very gradual, and the pace of change is very slow. In September 2022 I presented a petition to the House on behalf of my constituents, Peta and Shane Arthurson, to ask the House to immediately increase paid parental leave from 18 to 26 weeks. That was simply on the basis of the benefit to children of being able to be breastfed for the period of time that is actually recommended. This bill now fulfils what the Arthursons' petition asked for but at a slow pace, rolling the extension out until 2026. No doubt the government will campaign on this at the next election as an election pledge to families, prior to this full instalment of parental leave being available, but it is a long way off and, I would argue, needed much sooner. So I support this bill, but there is more work to be done on the paid parental leave front and for achieving greater equality and economic security for Australian women. We need to get to gender equity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final report of the government's Women's Economic Equality Taskforce was released in late October. While this bill doesn't go as far as that report recommends, it is worth noting what more can be done and is recommended in that report. The final report recommended extending the Paid Parental Leave scheme by phasing the entitlement up to 52 weeks; legislating the payment of superannuation on all forms of paid parental leave; increasing investment in childhood education and abolishing the activity test, which requires both parents to be working to access childcare subsidies; boosting the availability of high-quality flexible work and strengthening the right of employees to flexible work and family-friendly working arrangements; encouraging employers to set gender equality targets and strengthen reporting obligations to include meaningful benchmarks; and introducing a tax offset for people with caring responsibilities who are re-entering the workforce, to curb the motherhood penalty facing women which means they earn less—and I should note that, invariably, it is women who take time out for caring for elderly parents as well, and that further impacts their superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of bold reforms recommended in the report are what we need not just for paid parental leave but for actual economic equality. When women succeed, Australia succeeds. We need to stop seeing such initiatives as costs and rather think of them as investments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I noted at the beginning of this speech, the untapped economic potential that we have that can be unleashed by lifting women's economic participation and making them more economically secure is what we should be focusing on. As stated by the current head of the Productivity Commission, 'If untapped women's workforce participation was a massive iron ore deposit, we would have governments falling over themselves to give subsidies to get it out of the ground.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is yet to fully respond to the report on women's economic equality. I would hope that all reforms will be implemented, and I would encourage the government to lay out the pathway to do so. As the chair of the taskforce, Sam Mostyn, has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have arrived at a moment of consequence where a genuine commitment to respecting women, and valuing and nurturing their economic contribution by removing systemic barriers, is vital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us today takes a step in that direction, but it's only a step. More needs to be done. I urge the government to do more so that we can empower Australian women, make smart investments in our future and try to achieve genuine economic equality in the years ahead.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  Today I advocate before the House the passage of the transformative legislation that is positioned at the core of family welfare, economic progress and gender equity. This bill, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023, forms the second tranche of the Albanese Labor government's paid parental leave reforms. It follows the legacy of Labor's noteworthy contributions to family welfare—contributions which include Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the introduction of paid parental leave in 2011. This bill stands as a testament to our ongoing dedication to shaping a more inclusive, flexible and equitable paid parental leave system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard Labor government's introduction of paid parental leave in 2011 marked a historic milestone in Australian social policy. As Prime Minister, Julia Gillard's commitment to the wellbeing of working families was manifested in the establishment of this scheme. The 18-week payment, fully funded by the government, marked a pivotal moment for Australian families. This visionary reform ensured that parents, particularly mothers, were supported following childbirth. It provided financial support during a crucial life event and advanced workplace and economic equality for women. Former minister for families and member for Jagajaga the Hon. Jenny Macklin MP expressed the incredible significance of the introduction of paid parental leave in 2011. She stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This historic reform is a major win for working families who have been waiting decades for a national Paid Parental Leave scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal member for Holt I have the privilege of regularly engaging with families at various community events. It is heartwarming to witness firsthand the profound love and commitment that parents have for their children. The joyous moments shared at these gatherings underscore the desire of parents to be actively present in their children's lives and play an integral role in their upbringing. It is evident that families cherish the precious time spent together fostering strong bonds and creating lasting memories, especially during those crucial early months after childbirth. The introduction of this paid parental leave aligns with these sentiments, recognising the invaluable role parents play in the early years of a child's life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on the legacy of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's pioneering move, today's bill embodies the ongoing commitment of the Labor Party to continue increasing support for Australian families. Funded through the October 2022 budget, the measures in this legislation stand as a beacon of our unwavering commitment to creating a more inclusive, flexible and gender-equitable paid parental leave system. At the heart of the bill lies the extension of paid parental leave to 26 weeks, a significant leap from the current 20 weeks. This expansion has been methodically planned with an incremental addition of two weeks each year, starting from July 2024 and increasing to a 26-week period by July 2026. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill signifies a profound shift in response to the evolving needs of Australia families. This initiative is not merely a policy change. It is a reflection of our commitment to making families a top priority. Families are at the forefront of the Albanese Labor government's policy agenda. This commitment is embedded in the fabric of our government, recognising that strong, healthy families form the bedrock of a prosperous and cohesive society. Let us delve into the details of this transformative legislation, focusing not just on its national implications but also on the direct benefits it will bring to the families of Holt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are lengthening the payment period. The extension from the current 20-week period to 26 weeks provides a more sustainable foundation for parents to nurture their newborns and infants. The extra weeks of financial support will mean that families can focus on the crucial early stages of their children's development without the undue stress of financial constraints. We are reserving weeks for each parent. The bill advocates for an increase in the number of reserved weeks for each parent from two to four. This 'use it or lose it' provision ensures that both parents actively participate in the caregiving process by encouraging shared parental responsibilities. We are not just promoting family values; we are laying the groundwork for a more equitable society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Acknowledging the significance of family dynamics and the need for flexibility, the bill proposes to double the period during which parents can take paid parental leave at the same time, reaching four weeks in 2025. This reform is not just about flexibility; it is about acknowledging the diverse ways families structure their lives and about providing a necessary support to accommodate those differences. The road map for those changes is crafted with input from the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, whose recommendations have been instrumental in shaping a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Their insights, coupled with the experience and needs of families in Holt, have shaped a policy that is not just top-down but is rooted in the lived realities of Australian households. This legislation acknowledges the importance of supporting families by providing the means for parents to spend more time with their children during these formative stages, allowing them to nurture a foundation of love, care and connection that will endure throughout their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these advancements, the bill addresses a minor technical amendment to ensure fathers who do not meet the work test requirements, due to premature births, can access paid parental leave. This provision, already in place for birth parents, ensures that all parents have equal opportunities to bond with and care for their newborns. The implementation of these changes is slated to commence from July 2024, applicable to births or adoptions from that date onward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill marks the largest expansion of paid parental leave since its inception in 2011, representing a total investment of $1.2 billion over five years. The positive reception of these reforms by family and gender advocates, employers, the Business Council of Australia and the ACTU speaks volumes about the potential positive impact of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that over 180,000 families across Australia will benefit from the extended paid parental leave each year. Within my electorate of Holt, this initiative will be a game changer. The impact of this legislation will be tangible and transformative for my community, given that 82 per cent of households in Holt are families. The lives of families within our community will be directly touched by the extended support and financial security and the equitable framework that this bill proposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, this expansion is a strategic move towards greater gender equality. By encouraging shared care and increasing the reserved period, the bill aims to foster an environment where both parents get actively involved in the upbringing of their children. Investing in paid parental leave is not just about supporting families; it's about boosting the overall health and wellbeing of our society. It is about recognising that families are the backbone of our nation. Ensuring that they have the support they need is fundamental to our prosperity. Under the Albanese Labor government, families are seen not as mere constituents but as vital contributors to the nation's success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the 46,000 families in Holt, this bill is not just about providing financial support during crucial life events; it is about recognising the central role families play in shaping the social fabric of our country. Our commitment to this reform is not merely political; it is deeply rooted in the understanding that an equitable paid parental leave system is crucial for the health and wellbeing of parents and children. We know that investing in paid parental leave is not just a cost but an investment in the future, a future where children can thrive, parents are supported and the entire nation prospers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look towards the future, it is imperative that our Paid Parental Leave scheme aligns with the realities of modern Australian families. It is imperative that our Paid Parental Leave scheme is flexible, fair and committed to driving positive health, social and economic outcomes for both parents and their children. This bill is a declaration of our dedication to the wellbeing of Australian families. It stands as a testament to our belief that supporting families is not just a policy; it is a fundamental duty of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed are carefully balanced, providing increased support to mothers, encouraging active involvement of fathers and offering families the flexibility they need. This bill is not just good for parents; it is good for children, good for employers and good for the economy. It is a declaration that, as a nation, we value and prioritise the crucial role of parents in shaping the future of our society. I urge each member of parliament to stand united in support of this transformative legislation. Together, let's usher in a new era of support, equality and prosperity for the families of this great nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude by applauding the work of the Minister for Social Services, the Hon. Amanda Rishworth MP, for her exceptional work in spearheading the reform of paid parental leave in this country. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I'd like to begin by acknowledging the important steps being taken by the government and the Women's Economic Equality Task Force. One thing that motivated a lot of voters at the last election was a very real sense that we had a government which didn't understand the concerns and priorities of women—and didn't have enough women in the government either—and had no interest in learning, let alone acting. So I gratefully acknowledge the change we have seen over the last 18 months and the progress that is being made against some of those concerns. The bill today, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023, is part of that progress. It is a step towards the equality and equity that so many Australians want to see, and I welcome it. It implements a further expansion of the Paid Parental Leave scheme, expanding the total leave entitlement for partnered parents to 26 weeks over the next three years, up from the current 20 weeks. It also increases the number of reserved weeks—that is, weeks that can only be taken by the second parent—from two to four, and it does the same for concurrent leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansions are important and they are welcome. They will make a real difference in the lives of many new parents. But, honestly, we should not believe for a second that these movements and changes are sufficient. In particular, I do not believe they will change the culture of parenting in Australia, which is that it is predominantly the responsibility of the mother, and that must be the ambition of future reforms and of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you some personal examples. I and many of my friends had children around the same time, and many of us had partners—in the cases where it was a man and woman—with similar careers, similar ambitions and similar career trajectories. I would say that probably in at least 80 per cent of cases the partners were relatively equal in their careers, and that changed when children came along, because with my family and those of my friends, in 80 per cent of cases, it was the women who took a back seat, because they took a front seat in caring for children. There are a number of men, who I'm very proud of, who took an active role, taking on significant care of children, going part time themselves and taking significant parenting leave when the children were born. But these were not the majority. This is a culture that I think we need to change, because that time when the women take on more care of the children has a significant impact on women's economic equality. It certainly did for me and the friends that I have in this space. This is why I think it's so critical that we change the culture. I think that this parenting bill could have gone further, and I urge the government to continue to go further in changing the culture and making parenting a truly shared endeavour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the research on this, beyond the anecdotes from me and my friends. Research from the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that the average number of hours worked by fathers doesn't change significantly after the birth of a child, while the situation for mothers is completely different: the number of hours they work falls by around two-thirds on average. We have a gendered segregation of parenting responsibilities, and this is an enormous issue for the economic participation of women. This is one of the main drivers of the motherhood penalty, the 55 per cent reduction in women's earnings once they become mothers. This is not appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a country that invests heavily in educating our women and promoting an equal and equitable society, but the fact is that, honestly, these efforts are not translating into the outcomes we want to see. Research by the Grattan Institute has shown that, on average, female parents do two hours more of unpaid care per day than male parents, and male parents do two hours more of paid work per day. Parenting habits at the early stages of a child's life, at those critical early days, are critical in determining future parenting strategies and that sharing of caring, and that is why supporting new parents to equally share the parenting is absolutely critical.</span>

I recently emailed Mallee constituents to ask them to share their cost-of-living stories. I have to say, they are heartbreaking. I received hundreds of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 12 interest rate rises under this government, spiralling food and petrol prices and obscene electricity costs are taking their toll. Ken King, of Birchip, tells me he and his partner require regular trips to attend a medical specialist in Bendigo and Melbourne, many hours away, which comes at a great cost given the price of fuel. Ken notes this is on top of inescapable rising grocery prices because in a small town like Birchip there is no cheap alternative. Glenda Booth, in Lake Boga, worries she is being forced into aged care because she cannot afford rising costs of living in her home. Glenda is juggling home and car insurance, groceries, power bills and private health insurance, which she needs to pay for cochlear implants. Ian Jeffrey, from Avoca, is 70 years of age and is being forced to dip into his savings just to pay his bills. Elizabeth told me she doesn't use her heating or cooling, and free camping is the only holiday she can afford. Christmas presents are an unaffordable luxury—how sad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have written to me who are entitled to retire but feel they simply cannot afford to. Families on dual incomes tell me their mortgage of around $300,000 in Mallee has increased by $1,000 a month—money they have to find from somewhere. A young mother of three children tells me she feels she is missing out on being a mum because she has to put in extra hours along with her husband just to meet their family's needs. Some of my constituents have cut down to one to two meals a day, if you can call peanut butter and Vegemite on toast a meal. This is no way for people to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's economic mismanagement is heaping pressure on Australian families. Michele Bullock, the Reserve Bank governor, has confirmed that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors. It is increasingly homegrown, she says. Yet the Treasurer and the Prime Minister blame the rest of the world—and the coalition, I might say—for their failures on inflation and the economy. High inflation, soaring interest rates and rising income taxes means Australia has recorded the biggest fall in disposable household income of any developed country. Labor are hellbent on eyewateringly expensive pet projects, whether it's throwing business under the bus for their union masters or the secretive cost of the Murray-Darling buyback wrecking ball, slapping Australian farmers with a biosecurity bill run up by foreign importers and their competitors—not to mention raping and pillaging prime agricultural land with their reckless rush to renewables and transmission lines.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor needs to rein in government spending on vanity projects that have no material benefit for our communities. Instead of fixing its cost-of-living crisis, Labor remains obsessed with dragging Australia into its ideological inferno—a failed climate and energy plan and throwing incendiary buckets of taxpayer money to large energy companies to feed its climate action volcano. And why is this so? It is to shore up Greens-leaning electorates for Labor. Labor's reckless, debt driven agenda appeases an aggressive agenda. They cook the books to pretend nuclear energy is a pariah, yet it is the energy minister who is making Australia a pariah on the global stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best way to effectively combat the rising cost of living and to lower checkout prices is to reduce, not increase, the cost for farmers and other producing people. This is what Mallee residents and families need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Annual inflation looks to have peaked, with the CPI at 5.4 per cent in the September 2023 quarter, down from a peak of 7.8 per cent in the December quarter last year. Part of the reason for this has been the careful budgets brought down by the Treasurer, who has provided targeted, non-inflationary relief and balanced budgets while paying down debt. The RBA governor has said our budget strategy is very helpful and very positive, and the ABS has shown that our cost-of-living policies have taken half a percentage point off inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're targeting relief for household budgets where we can and we're getting wages moving for everyone. The government is steering the economy towards a better, more sustainable future, but the big-picture policies often feel removed from people's day-to-day lives. That's why I've organised a forum in Hasluck next month to provide some real, tangible advice to Hasluck locals on how to save money on bills, debts and essentials. It will help provide access to the discounts, concessions and services that they're actually entitled to and will put them in touch with some financial and legal counselling. This cost-of-living help hub will be held from 10 am to 1 pm on Saturday 9 December at Swan View Senior High School in Hasluck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hasluck is in many ways a typical peri-urban electorate. One way in which it is distinct, though, is that 53 per cent of our households are currently paying a mortgage and another 18 per cent are renting. That means that at least 71 per cent of families in Hasluck really do feel it when interest rates rise and when the cost of living is high. But it also means that families in Hasluck have stood to benefit the most from the government's targeted assistance. The government's helpful measures include paid parental leave, fee-free TAFE, cheaper child care, housing assistance, a strengthened Medicare and electricity bill relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave will increase by two weeks every year from July 2024 to 2026. Fathers and mothers in Hasluck will be able to better manage what is simultaneously a stressful and joyous time. Some 526 students, including those from families with older children and those returning to training, have taken advantage of fee-free TAFE at North Metropolitan TAFE in Midland, which is in the heart of Hasluck. There'll be a further 22,000 fee-free places at TAFE in Western Australia in 2024. Fee-free TAFE is a game changer, allowing families to access skills and training which they might otherwise have had to forgo and allowing us to create the skills base needed for the jobs of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since July this year the household budgets of over 5,600 families in Hasluck and over a million families across Australia have been benefiting from cheaper child care. This has meant that families have been able to budget better and also choose more days for their children, in many cases allowing parents to take on more employment, if that's what they choose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Housing Australia Future Fund and other programs, this government is acting to solve the housing crisis. Our responsible budgets have had an ameliorating effect on inflation. We've increased rent assistance by 15 per cent. Fully 18 per cent of families in Hasluck are renting, so this measure alone will have significantly assisted thousands of household budgets in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also providing the greatest investment in Medicare and our health system since Medicare was first created by the Hawke government in 1984. We have tripled the bulk-billing incentive for children and concession card holders. We have reduced the maximum cost for PBS prescriptions and enabled doctors to write 60-day scripts for chronic conditions, saving people time and money. In Hasluck, a Medicare urgent care clinic will open soon in Midland, taking pressure off hospital EDs and providing further fee-free assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Hasluck, eligible residents and businesses will notice a reduction in their power bills. The Albanese government and the state Cook Labor government together have provided meaningful relief worth up to $750. The Albanese government is helping Hasluck households. I hope many of the residents of Hasluck do come down to the cost-of-living help hub at Swan View Senior High School on Saturday 9 December from 10 am to 1 pm to talk to local groups, representatives from government and private organisations to find out all the different ways that they can save on their personal household budgets whilst we get on with the business of making cost-of-living relief for Australians across the whole country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  My community is still reeling from the decision announced nearly two weeks ago to rip funding away from the Truro bypass. This is a vital project that would have seen a significant amount of heavy freight redirected out of the suburbs of Adelaide—particularly the suburbs of my electorate of Sturt—and around the back of the Adelaide Hills, which is a much safer and more sensible place for that heavy freight to be distributed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is freight that is not destined for the suburbs of Adelaide. In fact, most people react with surprise if not shock to learn that if you're sending heavy freight from the city of Melbourne to the city of Perth, you drive through suburban Adelaide on Highway 1 because Portrush Road, which runs right through my electorate, is designated as Highway 1. The Princes Highway runs down through the tollgate into the suburbs of Adelaide, up Portrush and Hempstead, across Grand Junction and then north again. No other metropolitan city in this country has their main heavy freight route running through their suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were very excited when the former Liberal governments at a state and federal level identified and committed to investing in the Truro bypass. They put that money in the budgets. The state Labor government have that money in their budget. It's in the budget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr STEVENS:</span>
                  </a>  I recognise how the minister would have tried to sell all these dramatic cuts to infrastructure to the backbench of the Labor Party. I can assist the member for Hasluck by saying that the member for Boothby, her colleague, was at a community meeting with me last Monday. The member for Boothby indicated that she'd had a conversation with the infrastructure minister and the infrastructure minister had said: 'Well, we can fund that project. If that's an important priority, we'll find a way to fund it.' This was a comment made by the member for Boothby at a significant public meeting. I appreciate the member for Hasluck giving me the opportunity to get that on the record in the parliament, and I'm sure the member for Boothby will thank the member for Hasluck for providing that opportunity!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need this decision reversed. We have had the state Labor infrastructure minister say very publicly that they are still committed to this project. It is in the state budget and it was in the federal budget. The decision was made many years ago to invest in this project. It's a little over $200 million. We all understand some of these projects have increased in price, but the state Labor government see it as a priority. The member for Boothby claims it's a priority. It's certainly a priority for me and my community, for the local government sector in my area and throughout that corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an obvious project and an obvious priority, and it has fallen victim to a disgraceful and atrocious decision to rip money out of that project to instead finance other projects that are priorities of this Labor government. My community knows that that priority—getting heavy freight out of my suburbs—is not a priority of this Labor government, and they will have something to say about that when they get the opportunity to send a message to this government at the next federal election. It's not only my seat of Sturt that are furious about this; the people in electorates like Boothby and Adelaide are equally significantly affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have schools along the route. We've got 17 sets of lights where these big B-doubles thunder down through the suburbs. And we're not critical of the trucking industry whatsoever. We're grateful for that heavy freight. Freight is the lifeblood of our economy, replenishing our supermarkets, going to export markets and earning money in our economy. But it's very sensible—and the trucking industry were at this public meeting and they support the fact—that it would be better to have an efficient bypass route going around the back of the Adelaide Hills for that heavy freight, particularly when it never needs to come into Adelaide but for the fact that that is the current route that we governments have told heavy vehicles to use. They would much rather use a more efficient route.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great excitement for us, which has been cruelly ripped away from our community just before Christmas, was investing in that Truro bypass, plugging in the freight from Monarto up to Truro and moving all that heavy freight out of suburban Adelaide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll keep fighting for this, and in the coalition we'll keep fighting to get this decision reversed. It's a very sensible investment. It has a very good rating from Infrastructure Australia. It is seen as a natural, significant priority that also brings enormous freight efficiency and economic benefit. The disgraceful decision of this Labor government to rip that money out needs to be reversed. I will keep fighting in my community to see that happen. We will use people power to send the strongest message imaginable that our community deserves to be invested in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise to knowledge that 25 November marked the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and began 16 days of activism against gender based violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It saddens me that we have had so many women killed by acts of violence in Australia this year and that one in three Australian women have experienced physical violence perpetrated by a man. Globally, an estimated 736 million women have been subjected to physical and/or intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual violence or both at least once in their life. Too many women and children experience gender based violence in Australia. In WA, 63 per cent of all assaults are family violence related.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence against women and girls is a human rights violation, and the immediate and long-term physical, sexual and mental consequences for women and girls can be devastating, including death. Violence negatively affects women's general wellbeing and prevents women from fully participating in society. Recent statistics paint a stark reality—gender based violence against women is pervasive in our country. It transcends socioeconomic, cultural and geographic boundaries. It is not merely a women's issue; it is a societal issue that demands a comprehensive response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the work of the family, domestic and sexual violence sector for delivering vital services for women, children and men. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the Patricia Giles Centre for Non-Violence, situated in my electorate of Pearce. The centre is named after former Australian senator Patricia Giles AM, a lifelong active and passionate advocate for community service and women's rights. For over 30 years, the Patricia Giles Centre for Non-Violence has been providing an expert range of services for women and children escaping and affected by family and domestic violence and abuse in Western Australia. The centre aims to build and empower families and communities to live free from gender based violence, by providing services to help break the cycle of violence, whether it be caused by physical, financial, sexual, social isolation or emotional and psychological abuse or by denying the woman her spiritual and cultural beliefs and values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence against women need not be inevitable. I am proud to be part of a government working in partnership with state and territory governments across Australia to address the underlying factors that drive gender based violence. The Albanese Labor government has invested $2.3 billion in women's safety, including more than $325 million in prevention initiatives specifically, across our first two budgets. This includes funding for initiatives like our consent and respectful relationships education, sexual violence prevention pilots and funding to support the work of Our Watch, the leading national organisation for primary prevention of family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is taking practical steps to support victims of family and domestic violence. We have reduced by 22 days the time it takes victims-survivors to access support under the escaping violence payment. We have secured funding for states and territories to deliver frontline services—funding that was due to cease on 30 June under the previous government. We committed to and are delivering new frontline community sector workers to support victims-survivors of family, domestic and sexual violence, with funding to support the first tranche of workers now flowing to all states and territories. We also legislated 10 paid days of family and domestic violence leave for all employees, including casuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, tackling gender and sexual violence against women is not just a moral imperative; it is a societal obligation. It demands our unwavering commitment both as individuals and as a nation. We can all play a role in violence prevention, whether it be at work, in our religious institutions or community groups or as parents, grandparents or friends. Let us stand together to challenge the norms that perpetuate violence, amplify the voices of survivors and work towards a future where every woman can live free from fear. By confronting the issue head-on we can build a society that champions equality, respect and the inherent dignity of every individual that they so deserve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286535" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I rise today to speak about Remembrance Day. I do understand that it was a couple of weeks ago, but this is my first opportunity to speak about this very important day. For me it's right up there with Anzac Day and Australia Day as days that should be preserved for Australia. I was very fortunate this year to be in my home town of Bowen, which is located slap-bang in the middle of my electorate of Dawson. I was asked to say a few words and lay a wreath on behalf of the federal government and also on behalf of our community. I was joined by veterans; current serving defence personnel; war widows; legatees; nashos; emergency services personnel; police, fire and ambulance personnel; the principal and school leaders from Bowen State High School; and members of the public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were services held the length and breadth of Dawson, and they were extremely well attended. And, because it was on the weekend, they were well attended by our youth as well, which showed our ongoing spirit of remembering and acknowledging our service personnel and our veterans, some who paid the ultimate sacrifice. They paid with their lives so that we can live in the fantastic country that we live. It's also a reminder that these liberties and freedoms that we enjoy each and every day don't just come by accident. They have been hard fought for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to name a couple of people that helped and are always there for us on the day. Roger Hine, who is the president of the Bowen RSL, did a fantastic job as emcee of the proceedings and delivered the all-important ode. Well done to Roger. Terry Hansen is the president of nashos and an outstanding Bowenite. He's been the president of the Nashos for a long period of time—services on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. But he also goes above and beyond that and, with his wife, Elsa, he goes out to Cunningham Villas, which is an aged-care facility that looks after a lot of veterans in our area. They run services out there as well which are really enjoyed by those who live in that facility. Eileen Crouch, who is the president of the CWA, is always on hand to cook a nice cake and provide the ex-diggers with scones and sandwiches. The whole CWA in Bowen do an outstanding job. Stacher Wilson, a war widow, Alf's wife, holds court up in the corner with the legatees and the war widows. While they have their time to commemorate, they also have a good time with their friends when they get together, and they enjoy the day. There's Joy Hose as well, a friend of mine and a war widow—Bob's wife. He was in the Army. Unfortunately, we lost Bob, but he was president of the RSL in Bowen for a long period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remembrance Day is the day when the guns on the Western Front fell silent—on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. Originally it was Armistice Day, and then it moved to being Remembrance Day because Armistice Day was going to be for the last war that we had, but unfortunately, less than a decade later, we had another world war and we've been having conflicts ever since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's support on both sides of this House for growing our Defence Force. I'm certainly keen to grow our Defence Force, but I think how we need to do that is by showing that we value our current veterans and our current defence personnel. We need to make sure that we look after the people with PTSD. There were a lot of people in that room who had nursed someone either back physically or through their mental issues. In order to grow our Defence Force, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we possibly can for the people that have served our country. Remembrance Day is also about a time for us to say thank you for those who have laid down their lives for this country so we can enjoy it as it is. All of us should be beholden to make sure that we take advantage of the great liberties that they fought for. Lest we forget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  We are all very lucky to call Australia home. It is a country that comes with opportunity. It is a place where there is peace and, most importantly, we have respect for each other. Recently we have watched and heard about the horrors happening outside our borders, with international conflicts at the front and centre of our minds. In this challenging time, we must rally around the principles that define our humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of you know, I am a Buddhist, but I want to share a quote from the Bible that my constituent has asked me to speak to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very simply, it asks that we learn to love our neighbours as we love ourselves. We are all human. We must learn to embrace each other and our differences, guided by compassion. We know that by working together we can overcome mistakes which have happened in the past and most importantly learn the necessity of forgiveness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on the atrocities of war before and know that it is a foolish, foolish exercise. I have and always will advocate for peace. Yet so many within our own local communities are directly affected by global unrest—so many people crying for justice for the innocent. I wholeheartedly say this: there is no place in our modern society for antisemitism or Islamophobia, and racism has no home in Australia. As a representative of my electorate of Tangney, I know that we must build on social cohesion and safeguard the safety, security and wellbeing of our communities. In the face of adversity, it is easy to succumb to fear and division. However, history has shown us that unity is our greatest strength. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Australia is a diverse, colourful blend of cultures, backgrounds and beliefs. We are a country that is blessed with multiculturalism. We embrace our differences, and all of us have come to this shore, by air or by sea, at some point in our generational time lines, looking to better ourselves and our loved ones. We must all work together to cultivate an environment that fosters understanding and appreciation for our differences. I will say this again: no-one should ever feel threatened because of who they identify as, be prosecuted for their religious beliefs, or be racially profiled or attacked just because of their looks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this because I'm a proud migrant from Malaysia; I'm a Chinese man; I am a practising Buddhist, a husband, a father and a grandfather, but most importantly I'm someone who has been elected by the good people of Tangney to stand here in this House to speak out the voices of those who are often silenced. I stand here as a proud member of this Albanese government, which I know actively promotes and works towards unity, transcending differences that may otherwise divide us, regardless of our political differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not an isolated island in the sea of global affairs. I know as a government representative that we all have a role to play on this international stage in fostering peace and stability. Our country's diplomatic efforts have been intensified, advocating for dialogue, cooperation and conflict resolution, all in respect of international law. We act to not only safeguard our shores but also contribute to a world where peace is the common currency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, let us all commit to working together with our communities for better social cohesion, safety, security and wellbeing. This is not just a call for action; it is a pledge to safeguard the fabric of our society. Together, let us embrace the values that define our shared humanity. May we stand strong in the face of adversity, guided by the principles which I spoke of when I first got into parliament: peace, love, unity and respect. Together we can pave the way for a brighter, more harmonious future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  The Central West of New South Wales is one of the most vibrant regions of this great country that we proudly call home. While abundant in natural beauty and resources, it's an incredible place to live because of the generations of hardworking residents and strong communities which have had a vision for what they could achieve and dared greatly to make it happen. Region-building projects require the foresight to see beyond what is and picture what could be—region-building projects like the Great Western Highway upgrade, which would have helped bridge the great divide between city and country by strengthening the road system which connects them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Devastatingly, the federal Labor government has proved time and time again that the vision of an Australia where country areas stand on equal footing with city areas is not one they share. The federal government just axed over $2 billion of funding and walked away from the Great Western Highway upgrade between Katoomba and Lithgow. This repugnant decision stinks of city favouritism. It's robbing the regions. It's a shameless and blatant burgling from the bush. It's spitting in the face of country communities which deserve a Great Western Highway that lives up to its name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The upgrade was more than just a road project; it was an opportunity to finally fix the passage over the Great Dividing Range, improving road accessibility from country to city and boosting regional transport, health and tourism outcomes. Everyone in western New South Wales has experienced the long and infuriating traffic jams in and out of Sydney. Infrastructure Australia termed the project 'a key enabler of regional development'—a strong case to retain this funding, one might be led to believe. Even the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government said so herself earlier this year, telling local media that the funding remained on the table and that the project was 'needed'—hollow assurances for the people of central western New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities have been waiting years for a decent road over the mountains, and this latest cut is as disgraceful as it reprehensible for the people west of the Great Dividing Range. The people of our area deserve far better. I have demanded the urgent reversal of this disgraceful cut and also requested an urgent meeting with the minister to explain to me how she will be reversing this outrageous decision. For the past 18 months, the Labor government has looked at our region as though it's a money box from which to pilfer hard-won funding. First, we had the $27.8 million that was sitting in the bank for the Dixons Long Point project snatched away. Then they came for the $12.5 million for the second Bathurst racetrack at Mount Panorama/Wahluu, and now we have news that upgrades to the Great Western Highway at Lithgow have been killed off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Axing this project shows that this government does not understand country communities and how important it is to improve key transport links between the city and the bush. This betrayal is a dagger to the hearts of our communities and will not be forgotten. This city-centric funding cut is despicable, and I again call on the minister to reverse it and also to meet with me as I have requested. This outrageous cut is a shameful episode in the history of regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I was recently invited to present the NSW Volunteer of the Year awards for 2023 at the Hunter volunteers ceremony. I was really delighted to see Carole Delaney, a wonderful local, receive recognition for her tireless volunteer work. Carole has been volunteering at the Tomaree Neighbourhood Centre since 2004. Coming from a background in social work, she has been instrumental in the running of the emergency relief program at the neighbourhood centre, which provides crisis support to the most vulnerable in our community. Carole has assisted thousands of community members who have presented to the centre in crisis, through the provision of financial hardship relief, advocacy and referral. She also regularly shops for the community pantry and prepares hampers for clients in need. Carole has also been an excellent mentor to new staff at the Tomaree Neighbourhood Centre and has really put her heart and soul into providing help for our community. She's also worked at providing training and education on emergency relief and on how to provide the best outcomes for the Port Stephens community. Congratulations, Carole, on your recent award but more importantly on the contribution that you have made and continue to make for our community. It is just such a well-deserved recognition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, I want to speak about Eve Bryson. I'm really proud to talk about this young lady who is from my home town of Kurri Kurri and is doing amazing things in the world of female youth boxing. Eve recently competed at the national youth titles, where she gained valuable experience in the ring. She was also part of the national development training program team, and she's just returned from New Zealand, after competing at the Youth Tri-Nations Tournament, where she came out victorious in both her bouts—two from two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Eve has been training very hard and working at her skills every day, continuing her strength, conditioning and mindset under her coaching team, and that has enabled her to compete and grow her confidence at that level. Eve has also been selected to be part of the 2024 state futures program, which is focused on developing talent and producing future elite Australian representatives. Eve was recently awarded a Local Sporting Champions grant from my office, and I can't wait to see what the future brings for Eve. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very quickly, I want to give a big thanks to Westpac's Angel Billy rescue helicopter. We had a fantastic golf day, and our team was victorious. Thank you to Brendan Boyd, Christine Boyd and Peree Watson.</span>

As vice-patron of the surf club, I strongly support the recommendations contained in the report by the city's administration for the council to approve option 1.1, at an estimated cost of $14.87 million. I respectfully urge all councillors to support the officers' recommendation. I note that $8 million in funding has been committed by the WA state government, with the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club making a $1 million contribution, leaving the City of Joondalup to fund the remaining $5.87 million as part of its forward capital works program. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Founded in 1958, the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club is one of the largest sporting clubs in my electorate, with a membership of more than 2,200 members. In order to meet the needs of the current and forecasted membership base, support the development of junior members and provide the necessary training and community services, it is necessary to construct a modern clubroom facility for our club. The current clubhouse is more than 40 years old and past its use-by date. Public funds invested to provide functional modern facilities for the lifesavers who patrol our popular beaches, keeping our communities safe, represent a sound investment. The surf club redevelopment has been in process for several years; however, it has been frustratingly slow. The project should be expedited, with key milestones agreed upon to achieve timely completion, in line with community expectations.</span>

When it comes to surf lifesaving, as an essential community service, it does not make sense to penny pinch or allow party political agendas to get in the way of what is best for our whole community. I will not go into the details, as the political jockeying has been reported in the newspapers. </span>

The month also includes the celebration of International Men's Day. Movember raises awareness of prostate cancer and now also focuses on mental health, mental wellbeing and suicide prevention amongst men. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a society, we know that changing the face of men's health changes society. Encouraging men to stay healthy in all aspects of their life changes society. Staying socially connected and becoming more open to discussing mental health challenges also changes society. An understanding and promotion of these experiences are the foundation of positive male role models, without which our society at large would be grossly disadvantaged. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day working men, retired men and men seeking the dignity of work tackle issues in our society where job security, economic security and male expression are elements that are becoming more and more precarious. If we're to work on promoting men's health, improving gender relations, gender equality and highlighting positive male role models, we must address these issues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Parliament House recently we were joined by the Australian Men's Shed Association, with the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Shed, to launch Men's Shed Week to celebrate three decades of connection, community and camaraderie. I want to acknowledge our local Men's Shed in Craigieburn for the amazing work they do for men of all ages and social backgrounds in our local communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The beauty of our local Men's Shed, not unlike many in communities across Australia, is the diversity of its members from all backgrounds with ranging life experiences and skills, including social and cultural diversity. The group's activities have led to increased participation of men with mental health challenges and disabilities, including mobile challenges and mobility changes; men who are employed and unemployed; and men who are experiencing social disadvantage, all of whom carry a commitment to one another and to the broader community they live in.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the very hard work of Bruce Tripptree, the president of Hume Men's Shed in Craigieburn. The amazing work he and his team do to generate income for various projects and activities to cover the running costs enables the shed to significantly improve our local men's health. The extraordinary efforts of Bruce and his team in running various programs have led to an increase in membership, all due to their tireless dedication to creating an inclusive environment centred around empowerment and solidarity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many, Men's Shed is a home, and our community sees it as an extension of our own because of that organisation's vibrant and inclusive nature. In celebrating the contribution of men in our local community, I salute their efforts and congratulate all the men in my community who do a wonderful job each and every day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  As we head towards a Christmas much tighter than many of us had hoped for, Australians will be reflecting on some very important questions, questions that become more and more relevant every day the Albanese government continues on its current path: Are you better off today than you were before Labor came to power? Is life easier?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer was recently caught out by ABC's Fact Check after trying to convince Australian workers that they were better off. The fact is that real wages are going backwards, and they're going backwards at a rate faster than any other country in the developed world. This year, we've seen real wages go backwards by 5.1 per cent. At the same time, we've seen many other countries have their real wages go forward: America by 3.2 per cent and the UK by 2.2 per cent. Australians might be getting paid more, but we can afford less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Labor came to government, we've seen child care rise by 9.5 per cent and food rise by 8.2 per cent. Housing is up by 10.4 per cent, insurance is up by 17.3 per cent and electricity is up by 18 per cent. The reason your dollar isn't going as far is that Labor hasn't tamed inflation. Australia's headline inflation rate is now the worst of the 15 largest advanced economies of the world, at 5.4 per cent, and core inflation--which excludes food and energy--is third worst, at 5.2 per cent. Other countries have done a much better job than Australia of getting on top of inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA has now confirmed what we've all known for some time: inflation is being driven by domestic factors, by government decisions, decisions like increasing spending by $188 billion. Because of decisions like that, inflation is likely to be higher for longer. I believe that every day the government continues on its path, the answer to that question, 'Are you better off today than you were before Labor came to power?' will be a stronger and stronger no. We're seeing that in Roy Morgan Research. It shows that 55 per cent of Australians say they are financially worse off than they were a year ago. Less than a third of us think we'll be better off in a year's time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Treasurer was caught out trying to tell Australians they're better off, once again, just like the Voice referendum, it revealed a government out of touch with the Australian people. Before the election, the Prime Minister knew exactly what to say. He promised to cut your power bills by $275. That hasn't happened. Our power bills have gone up. He promised cheaper mortgages. That hasn't happened. Mortgages have gone up. He promised cheaper grocery bills and to drive down the cost of living. That hasn't happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister knew what to say to get into government, but he doesn't know what to do now that he's in government, and Australians are paying the price. Every additional dollar the government puts into the economy is another dollar that the RBA has to take out through interest rates. That is simple economics that households doing their budgets around the country can understand, but the Treasurer's 6,000-word manifesto on remaking capitalism failed to grasp. Once again, this is a government that is out of touch with the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Christmas, while the government tries to convince you what a great job it's done when it points to its wonderful success in giving unions more power in industrial relations, releasing hardened criminals onto our streets, driving off investment in mining and gas and cutting road safety projects in regional areas, ask yourself: are you better off today than you were before Labor came into power?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  On Wednesday 22 November 2023 at 1 pm, one of the worst bushfires in my electorate of Pearce started. Over the past few days, the fire has ravaged the suburbs of Mariginiup, Melaleuca, Jandabup, Wanneroo, Sinagra, Ashby, Tapping and Banksia Grove, with 1,870 hectares burnt, 18 homes lost and five damaged as well as sheds and numerous vehicles lost. Infrastructure, including power poles and water assets, has been damaged and businesses have been impacted, including a local strawberry grower who lost their entire crop. The vast market garden community has also been under threat. My sincere thanks go to those who responded immediately to mitigate the impact of this huge wall of flames.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago, I spoke in the House of Representatives about the importance of being bushfire ready. I would like to acknowledge the Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm and his team for their quick action in mobilising to fight tirelessly in response to the emergency; our local volunteer bushfire brigades within Pearce, whose skill sets and local knowledge have once again proved invaluable; Captain Paul Humphries of the Wanneroo Central Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade; Captain Sally Hawkins of the Wanneroo Volunteer Fire Support Brigade; Captain Brett Emerson of the Quinns Rocks Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade; and Captain Wendy Noone of the Two Rocks Bush Fire Brigade. They all responded and immediately activated their brigades, and they gave their all to keep our community safe. They did such an incredible job saving homes and property in extremely challenging circumstances. I'd also like to acknowledge and thank the new recruits, who have been training diligently throughout the year and who stepped up and fought with courage and determination. A huge shout-out and thankyou go to the brigades that came from right around Western Australia to help support those communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to recognise the volunteers in my local community, who are inspirational. Time and time again, I've seen them step up to help one another, whether it be a neighbour or a stranger. They continuously open their hearts and their homes. I cannot begin to imagine the anguish and stress experienced by residents who have lost their property, and my heart goes out to them. My thanks go to the federal Minister for Emergency Management, the Hon. Murray Watt, and Western Australia state Minister for Emergency Services, the Hon. Stephen Dawson, who responded quickly to ensure support was available. I'd also like to thank the Western Australian state Minister for Community Services and local state member for Wanneroo, the Hon. Sabine Winton, for all the assistance of the Department of Communities in once again supporting community members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bushfires prove how fast they can operate and how far a fire can travel and that living in suburbia does not mean you are immune from fire risk. My heartfelt thanks go to our incredible firies and to the community that has shown strength in times of adversity through their generosity and love for one another. I would also like to thank the Wanneroo Showgrounds in the city of Wanneroo for opening those showgrounds to help those fur babies and feather babies—the loved ones of others—and to make sure that they are safe and that they continue to keep safe in a good environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  This has been a bad year for Labor. Australians are turning against the Prime Minister, his government and his fellow travellers in state parliaments, especially in Western Australia. Whatever you're reading in the national polls, it's worse for Labor in my seat of Canning. In the weeks after the referendum, I've been speaking to locals—mainstream Australians who are friends and neighbours, who run small businesses and who are raising families and paying down mortgages. Talking to Australians is something the Prime Minister does not do. It's something that state Labor MPs—the member for Mandurah, the member for Dawesville and the member for Murray-Wellington—have stopped doing. What the people of Canning are telling me loud and clear is that they know that Labor will not fight for their interests. The Albanese government, the Cook government and Labor state MPs are obsessed with pet projects like the Voice and the failed Aboriginal cultural heritage laws. They've forgotten entirely what matters to Australians and, for the whole of this year, they've been missing in action, focused on themselves and not on the people that they're elected to represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Important projects that would improve or even save lives in my electorate have been cut or sacrificed by Labor. The upgrade of the Peel Health Campus is not even on the drawing board, but three years ago they committed $152 million to fix the hospital. Ambulance ramping is once again on the rise. At the same time, Labor has overseen a cost-of-living crisis. Soaring interest rates and rents are piling the pressure on families. More working families are relying on food banks and emergency shelter. The people of Pinjarra, who are forced to dodge over 690 trucks every day thundering through town, are asking the Prime Minister why he has axed the Pinjarra heavy haulage deviation. He promised it, then he delayed it and then he axed it all together—$200 million cut from the regions. It is a shocking kick in the guts for the people I represent. Again I ask: Where is the Prime Minister? Where is Premier Roger Cook? Where are David Templeman, Lisa Munday and Robyn Clarke? The people of Canning did not ask for the referendum on the Voice. They did not ask for the cultural heritage laws. They did not ask to be belted with Labor's cost-of-living crisis, housing crisis and axing of important infrastructure road projects that could save lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not listen, and it is not fighting for my community. I guarantee the people of Canning this, though: the Liberal Party will be fighting for you, and Peter Dutton is fighting for you. I'll continue to advocate for your interests in this place, and we'll be putting you front and centre over the next 18 months.</span>

It is a video that was put together by Sarah Martin and Peter Cooley from First Hand Solutions, and it's a documentary that tells the story of the revitalisation of the community mullet catch on Bidjigal land in La Perouse. It's something that the people have been doing for thousands of years—fishing to feed themselves and the community. For the La Perouse Aboriginal community, cultural fishing was not only a way to provide food but a key form of connection for the saltwater people. Everyone came together to help catch fish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, for generations, the community's cultural fishing was almost lost. Thanks to the efforts of many locals, including Tim Ella, Gary Ardler, Peter Cooley, Sarah Martin, Robert Cooley and the team of Gamay Rangers, the practice has now been revitalised. It includes young people who can assist with catching the fish and learning about connection to culture and their country. For many adults, the program represents a chance to spend quality time with their children and pass down knowledge about the art of fishing, having patience and, of course, catching and reeling in a big one. You can watch the impressive video on YouTube; just search for <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">atch </span><span style="font-style:italic;">'n' C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ook</span>.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 November I was privileged to join celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Kensington's St George Coptic Orthodox Church. The church has played a vital role not only within the religious sphere but within the broader fabric of the Kensington community. On 3 September 1972 the church was acquired and set up. It has had two visits from popes, from the inaugural liturgy in August 1973 to the consecration by His Holiness Pope Shenouda in 1989. Under the guidance of many, the church has gone from strength to strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It now runs youth groups and language programs. There's a scouts group, aged-care support, a disability program and an exercise and healthy-living program as well. It has also been a focal point for newly arrived migrants, particularly those coming from Egypt and settling in Australia—often coming without proficiency in the English language and without support from people. The church can be that support for many newly arrived migrants and is a great example of the success of Australian multiculturalism. So, to Father Marcos Tawfik and his team at the St George Coptic Orthodox Church, congratulations on 50 years and thank you for your work in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  There is absolutely no doubt that people in my community and communities around the country at the moment are doing it tough, and that's why the Albanese Labor government is working hard to make a difference and to deliver real cost-of-living relief for members of my community and those across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been so pleased to hear in recent weeks and days from members of my community who are saving money because of our cheaper medicines plan. Many patients in my community now receive twice the medication for the cost of a single prescription. From September 2024, this applies to more than 300 medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so patients with a 60-day prescription for a PBS listed medicine may save up to $180 a year per medicine if they are Medicare cardholders who do not have a concession card or $43 per medicine if they are concession cardholders. This is a real difference for people when they walk into the pharmacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the start of this month, our government has increased Medicare bulk-billing incentive payments for concession cardholders and children under 16 years of age for a range of consultation items. I do know how important this change is going to be for my community, where we have struggled with people being able to see a bulk-billing doctor. This will ensure that more people in Jagajaga are able to see a doctor who bulk bills and will address some of those cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, we promised to commit a Medicare urgent care clinic to Jagajaga, and I am pleased to say it is up and running in Heidelberg, helping to take pressure off the ED at the Austin Hospital, and is delivering for locals already. A local woman, Tanisha, has said this about her experience at the clinic:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My 3 year old daughter needed to be seen on a Sunday and we were able to see a doctor and have x-ray all in the one appointment. Thank you for providing such a wonderful service and for your prompt and caring attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government was elected to strengthen Medicare and to ease cost-of-living pressures. We are delivering on that promise by delivering cheaper medicines, tripling the bulk billing incentive and rolling out this network of Medicare urgent care clinics, including this one in Heidelberg, as I said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has also delivered on our election commitment for cheaper child care, meaning 6,600 families in my community have been saving on childcare costs since July this year. Childcare costs are a huge whack of any family's budget, and it is so important that we have made this change. I know these childcare subsidy increases do deliver real cost-of-living relief to local families. They support parents, particularly mums, to work more paid hours if they want to and they're also good for children, who get more access to quality education. This is a win for our community, it's a win for families and it is a win for the broader economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not there yet. We know there is much more to do to ease cost-of-living pressures for Australian families, and that's why I am proud to be part of a government that is working so hard for my community and for communities around this country at this difficult time.</span>

                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I rise to speak about the second youth mental health forum that I have organised in Mitchell on behalf of our community to address many of the ongoing youth mental health issues that we have seen following the pandemic in recent years. I want to thank all those key agencies within my electorate who attended: obviously, our local police area command; the Hills Clinic; different church and faith groups; headspace Castle Hill, which I was proud to advocate for and get for young people in our electorate; Youth Insearch; Hills Community Aid, the premier charity in my electorate; and the Community Migrant Resource Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second meeting focused on many of the things that we are hearing from young people and the challenges in front of them. I again say to the government: there are important things that need to be done in this space. The cuts that the Labor Party made to the PBS psychology sessions, from 20 to 10, has added pressure to local services. It's not a political issue—it's universal feedback from the community—and, given that we have a sustained increase in mental health challenges for young people, it's just simply bad policy regardless of the politics. We need to keep a high level of mental health service during this period. There's been overwhelming feedback about that issue, as well as other issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes the Labor Party runs from discussing Medicare or screams at us that it's privatisation, but the back end of Medicare needs attention. We still know that the provider numbers are out of date and not suitable for mental health challenges. They have to be reformed. It's something any government should take on—the Labor government should take it on with gusto—but we haven't heard anything about it. I'll just provide that feedback to the government again: in the Medicare system, there is a need to modernise and improve the ability for professionals to access the Medicare system for mental health services. We need to do that together as a parliament. On behalf of not only young people in my electorate but also, I think, people around Western Sydney and the country, I say, 'Let's get on with that task, rather than arguing about some of the politics around Medicare.' It simply needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked about vaping and the challenges with vaping. Again, I would say to the government and the health minister that vaping needs another look. It's a challenge for young people, for parents, for teachers and for us, but the government and the minister treating it in the way that they are is not contributing to a solution to this problem for young people. I note the member here who agrees. There are plenty of members on both sides who do agree. I think we put our heads in the sand on this issue. We're ignoring a serious challenge for young people, teachers and parents across Australia, and I'd ask the government to look at that again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a group of heroic individuals who live among us. They run into danger, when we run away. They leave their families to help others, when we cling to our own. They are our first responders. When they are doing everything they can to support the nation in times of need, we need to reciprocate. Ongoing comprehensive national support is crucial to enhancing the resilience and capability of our first responders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to move this motion today to ensure that the leading provider of support for our first responders, Fortem Australia, receives the continued funding it rightly deserves. Fortem is a not-for-profit organisation that, to date, has provided effective care to 15,000 unique first responders. Their service takes a holistic approach specific to the different roles that emergency personnel play and the unique challenges that come with those roles. The former Coalition government recognised the importance of the work and provided $10 million to support the establishment of Fortem's national support program. This funding was scrapped in the October 2022 budget handed down by the Albanese Labor government. Essentially, $8 million was cut overnight. After immense public pressure, the full $10 million in funding was restored, but it was clear that this program, designed to provide vital wellbeing services to our emergency personnel, was not valued by the Labor government. The writing was on the wall, then and now, and they are set to pull the plug for good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean? If continued funding is not announced, Fortem faces the risk of being forced to scale down its operations. This means that, from 1 December, they'll no longer be able to take on new clients. December 1 is the first day of summer, which is the start of the bushfire season and the impending wet season in Townsville. The important work that our first responders do is about to ramp up right when their support services are facing a cut. Our first responders have already had one hell of a spring season, with bushfires and floods sweeping across our nation. Our personnel are depleted, burnt out and, quite frankly, exhausted. This is when they need the support the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Herbert, in Townsville, Fortem established a presence in June this year. In this short period they have engaged with over 300 unique first responders and their families in our community alone. To put this in context, Townsville has nearly equalled the engagement seen in the city of Sydney over the last 11 months. This proves the growing need for services, particularly within rural and regional areas. Townsville is also facing the worst crime crisis it has ever seen. Without the state Labor government changing legislation to unshackle the judiciary system, the burden of keeping the city safe sits solely on the shoulders of our men and women in blue. That is another Labor government fail—at the state level, this time—leaving the first responders without hope in the law. They're in need of wellbeing support now more than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't have needed to move a motion in this place to bring attention to the issue on behalf of Fortem and the people they help. They have been fighting for a decision to be made for months, and the Minister for Emergency Management is now refusing to take their calls. Not only are they not providing Fortem with a straight answer; they are directing them to funding that is not fit for purpose, such as the disaster relief funding. The funding criteria clearly state that this is only suitable for pilot initiatives, not a proven concept such as Fortem. The Minister for Emergency Management would be aware of this, and I can only hope he did not knowingly give them a bum steer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortem has successfully supported over 15,000 unique individuals. That is 15,000 individuals who will be left out in the cold if the continued funding is not granted, and that is 15,000 individuals who will be shelved back into the public health system, a system that is being weakened by the state and federal Labor governments and is not fit to handle the nuances of the first responder world. This decision will result in a vacuum of support for first responders nationwide. I implore the government to back Fortem Australia through the announcement of continued funding by month's end. This is an urgent and fundamental national priority, and I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I love any opportunity to show support for our incredible first responders on our New South Wales South Coast. Across Australia, first responders are some of the highest valued members of our Australian community, and it is true that first responders are the crown jewel in all regional areas. I think it's fair to say that we rely on them more than in the cities. They are usually working under more difficult conditions, with bigger areas to cover and fewer services to rely on. In my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast, however, we feel that even more acutely. For us, first responders are our heroes. They were there for us to rely on in some of our darkest and hardest times. During the 2019-2020 bushfires, it was first responders that our community leant on and that were there for us. Our Rural Fire Service, a largely volunteer service—of course supported by retained firefighters and Fire and Rescue NSW—literally put their lives on the line for us. As bushfires raged all across the South Coast, with hundreds of homes lost and thousands more under threat, in conditions like we had never seen before, these absolutely incredible people did not hesitate to put their own lives on the line to save ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to remember that the bushfires of that terrible black summer didn't rage for days or weeks; they raged for months. The Currowan bushfire, which started in November 2019, burned for 74 days before finally being extinguished in February 2020. That bushfire alone destroyed nearly 500,000 hectares of land. It was our firefighters that helped to save thousands of homes and countless lives over those harrowing 74 days. Devastatingly, many homes were destroyed and lives were tragically lost. I was on the ground every single one of those 74 days, whether it was at fire control—I had two in my electorate—at the staging grounds spread across our coast, in the local RFS stations, in the evacuation centres or just out in the streets with those facing the impact. I was there, and there was barely a day that went by that I didn't see a first responder lending a helping hand and doing what they could where they could in really difficult circumstances. It's important not to forget that this was not just the RFS. There were first responders of every order: New South Wales police, paramedics, SES, marine rescue, St John Ambulance, defence, surf life saving—the list goes on. On the ground were also council workers, electricity providers, tree loppers and wildlife rescuers. I know I can't name everyone who was there. It was a whole-of-community effort, and we are grateful for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of those devastating bushfires, I spoke with so many of our first responders. They told absolutely heartbreaking stories. Our community experienced a shared grief, a shared trauma, that is not easily explained. In those early days as the bushfires raged, I spoke long and loud about the need for mental health support for our heroes, and I have continued talking about that ever since. On the South Coast, the bushfires were just one of many disasters to impact our community. We've had severe storms, we've had countless disaster declared floods—which we are still cleaning up from—and, of course, we have had a worldwide health pandemic. Our first responders face trauma every single day. They deserve our support. The Minister for Emergency Management, Murray Watt, also understands this. As the shadow minister back in 2019, he came to the South Coast many times to see for himself the impact of the bushfires. I know he felt that trauma too. Now, he, as the minister, and the Albanese government as a whole are steadfastly committed to supporting our first responders.</span>

The Black Dog Institute through the National Emergency Worker Support Service and the Australian Psychological Society through the Disaster Response Network are funded by the department of health until 30 June 2025 to provide direct support to first responders. We're also working on the National Disaster Mental Health and Wellbeing Framework and the national mental health plan for emergency services workers to ensure we have a coordinated approach to mental health support for our first responders.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  We live in an imperfect world. Things go wrong. Tragedies happen—car accidents, violent crime, natural disasters, fires and floods. There are moments where we find ourselves in crisis. In our moments of crisis, it is first responders who run toward the danger, when many of us seek refuge and safety away from it. Our police, our firefighters, our ambulance paramedics and our volunteers across those three areas are our first responders; they're the ones who embrace danger to save and preserve life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, one of those times was the Waroona-Yarloop fire, which devastated areas of my electorate in January 2016. What hit home to me, as I spent days speaking to the locals affected and saw the damage for myself, was the indiscriminate nature of the fire and how it paid no regard to containment lines of firebreaks. The historic town of Yarloop was destroyed. Two lives were lost, and many livestock perished in those fires. But, in the midst of the devastation and destruction, some houses remained untouched. This was a testament to the many local volunteers and emergency service workers who saved many houses and lives through their hard work and commitment to the preservation of lives and homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being on the receiving end of an event that requires emergency services characterises one of the worst days of our lives. But, for first responders, the worst day of people's lives is where they work, where they go. Like those emergency responders in the Yarloop fire, day after day they make critical decisions and provide a shield against the helpless situations that people find themselves in. They do so sacrificially, running into harm's way and courageously serving their communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their service is not without cost, though. On top of the daily risks they face, their sacrifices to their community place them under ongoing stress that can turn into mental health conditions. They are not unlike our ADF personnel, who carry the scars of their work. Beyond Blue has found that, compared to other Australians, police and other emergency service workers are twice as likely to experience high rates of psychological distress. Any government solution should empower and not override existing, organic relationships that people have. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortem acknowledges this, and that is why it offers services to families of first responders—so that the family unit itself is supported. In 2019, the former coalition government announced that it would provide nearly $2 million to Fortem. Since 2019, it has supported over 13,000 first responder families. In 2022, the coalition announced a further $10 million for Fortem, and, in November last year, Labor ensured this funding would be delivered. However, just one year later, the Albanese government has left Fortem for dead, refusing to provide funding beyond March of next year. Because of this, Fortem will have to start scaling back its programs from as early as this month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a kick in the guts for our hardworking emergency services personnel, particularly as we head into bushfire season. It's tough on families, who often are the ones who have to absorb the stress, the anxiety and the cost of the work conducted by our emergency service workers. When they get home, they often bring their experiences under the roof with their families. That's why this decision to cut funding to Fortem is so grievous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen in WA the devastating impact bushfire season can have, with 18 homes lost in Wanneroo—which is north of Perth—just last week. At Australia's time of need, the Albanese government turns to cuts to resources and capability. They've cut money from Fortem, and it's unacceptable. I urge the Prime Minister and his government to provide certainty to Fortem beyond March 2024.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  For many in our community, there will be no leisurely summer vacation strolling on the beach or hanging out after a boozy lunch. Our natural-disaster first responders, whether for fires or floods or cyclones, are either on call, in training or in the field. For them, the intensifying pressures of a changing climate are all too familiar. Their work is physically and mentally taxing, but it saves whole communities and keeps others, like mine, shielded from the worst of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country is grateful for the work of our first responders, but, more than feeling gratitude, we are focused on ensuring our nation is better prepared for the disasters coming, until humanity weans itself off fossil fuels and this planet stabilises. So what has been done in a short period time to better prepare us for national disasters? Plenty, it turns out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our earliest actions was amalgamating the National Recovery and Resilience Agency and Emergency Management Australia into one agency, NEMA. NEMA has coordinated the Albanese government's Disaster Ready Fund, which will invest $1 billion in disaster mitigation over the next five years, matching funding from other levels of government on projects like flood levies, cyclone shelters, bushfire detection text and evacuation centres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have begun work on building Australia's first national stockpile of critical emergency shelters by Humanihut. Each hut will sleep up to four people and comes with aircon, power, water and waste services. These will help establish mobile shelter camps, to be delivered by 30 June next year. The first camp will have an eventual capacity of 700 people, or over 1,400 first responders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've supported the leasing and positioning of a national fleet of firefighting aircraft, such that this year we will have over 500 aircraft—more than ever before. We've opened an upgraded national situation room, enabling better collaboration between all levels of government and non-government organisations. We've introduced a new, simplified fire danger rating system, so that we all understand risk and know what action to take. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NEMA has committed more than $3.85 billion in exceptional recovery assistance packages, with costs shared with the states. In the last budget, we committed more than $236 million over 10 years to ensure communities and first responders have reliable access to flood forecasts and warning, with Queensland prioritised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communication is key in times of crisis, especially for first responders, which is why we are investing in improving the National Messaging System and mobile broadband program, which will enable secure voice, video and data comms. Over $1 billion is going towards improving connectivity and resilience in the regions, including hardening the mobile network and ABC broadcasting towers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Organisations with relevant expertise are encouraged to apply to the $50 million Telecommunications Disaster Resilience Innovation Program, which aims to reduce impacts of power outages, which are the leading cause of telecommunications disruptions. Solutions may include off-grid power solutions or enhanced satellite connectivity, like the LEOs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Playing to the strengths in communities matters. This is why farmers, landholders and organisations are getting over $13 million to remove flammable weeds, develop emergency plans to protect and reduce threats to agricultural and environmental assets, and map critical habitat of threatened species. We have funded a veteran-run volunteer organisation called Disaster Relief Australia, which will help take some of the pressure off our ADF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeowners in harm's way have access to a free bushfire star rating app to better prepare their home and reduce insurance premiums. We have implemented 12 of the 15 recommendations of the bushfire royal commission, with the rest underway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once communities are affected, they need responsive government services, which is why we are boosting Services Australia by an additional 300 staff, at a cost of $228 million. These people will be stationed at capital cities, but also in regional New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the above interventions will collectively put downward pressure on the emergence of mental health issues amongst our first responders, but we also understand that we must tackle the root cause. The root cause of these intensifying weather events is indeed climate change, and this is why we have legislated ambitious but achievable targets. We are on track, but it's going to take a whole-of-society effort for us to get there. Like our first responders, we are all obliged to roll up our sleeves and be part of the change we want to see in this world. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community of Lindsay experiences floods, drought and also bushfires. We are pretty much at the front line of every single natural disaster in this country. This means that we have a big community of first responders, who do such a tremendous job serving our community. I would like to acknowledge every RFS volunteer, and I was able to do that just a couple of weeks ago. They put their lives on the line and commit so much to serving our community, and I know that they give up a lot when it comes to spending time with their own families. I'd also like to acknowledge our officers with the Nepean Police Area Command, with stations in both Penrith and St Marys; our firies from Fire and Rescue NSW; our paramedics; and our State Emergency Service personnel, among many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our first responders are often the first at a scene, and they go through this every single day, putting themselves at a high risk of multiple mental ill health conditions, such as depression, anxiety and, most of all, post-traumatic stress disorder. As I go across the country in my role as shadow assistant minister for mental health, I see how much people are struggling, particularly with what the country has been going through in recent times. Beyond Blue's national mental health and wellbeing study of police and emergency service workers shows that this group is more than twice as likely to experience high to very high rates of psychological distress. This is no surprise, given the sites they attend, the quick decisions they must make and the difficult conversations they must have. This combination is tough on its own, but constantly repeating it and not necessarily dealing with or overcoming the previous case is something that weighs heavily on a lot of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Senate's Education and Employment References Committee a few years ago inquired into ways of addressing the mental health experiences of first responders. The subsequent report made multiple recommendations. Recommendation 4 called for a national action plan, and the former coalition government allocated $4.5 million for it to be delivered in the Department of Home Affairs by the now opposition leader. The plan aimed to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental illness amongst emergency services workers. Further, recommendation 7 called for the extension of mental health services for all first responder volunteers. The coalition committed to this with $76 million for firefighters, emergency personnel and individuals impacted by bushfires. Additionally, the Mentally Healthy Workplace Alliance received over $11 million over four years from the 2020 financial year. Phoenix Australia Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health received over $1 million to develop a digital training platform to provide support and resources for health professionals who support individuals and communities affected by disasters. We also had the coalition's National Disaster Mental Health and Wellbeing Framework, which was announced after the Black Summer fires and was part of a recommendation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortem was launched by the then Minister for Home Affairs in 2019. The community organisation focuses on the wellbeing of frontline workers in Australia. It was founded by the co-founders of Soldier On. Fortem provides care to 15,000 first responders and their families, and the coalition before the last election committed $10 million for Fortem to continue its vital work for first responders. After a bit of intervention, the Albanese government in November last year committed to the funding but is yet to commit to continuing this funding beyond March next year. The government must support this important community organisation. The coalition backs Fortem. It's time for this Labor government to wake up and recommit to it.</span>

They stand up and are there to help when an individual or when the whole community needs them most. These people are our first responders. They are there responding to floods and fire, and they are there when there's an accident on our roads or when somebody is having a medical emergency. They are always there when someone is having one of the worst days of their life. Some do it for a living and some do it as a volunteer, but there is one thing that applies to all of them. It is that all of our first responders are heroes and we owe them so much.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate we've had our fair share of challenges lately. We've had floods, which wiped out towns, out-of-control fires, which have forced people to flee from their homes—and who could ever forget the horrible Greta bus crash, which shook all of us in the Hunter and in Australia. These events all meant that everyone in the Hunter had to come together and support each other. While these are all such different kinds of disasters, one thing that all of them have in common is the first responders, the people who are the first on the scene, providing the help and the care that people need, protecting people, protecting property and protecting lives. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a lucky country in so many ways, but one of the things that makes us so lucky is the fact that we have over 370,000 selfless individuals who put their lives on the line day in, day out in order to help their community as first responders. I know that the Hunter has had to deal with disasters over the past few years, but this just means that we have as good a reason as any other part of Australia to give thanks to and feel gratitude for our first responders. We have all seen them in action and we all owe them so much. That is why I have been proud to be able to see our community lift our first responders up every single time we have been faced with one of these disasters. Our community rallies are one. They give our first responders the recognition that they all deserve as the heroes that they are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something we don't always think about—but something that we can't forget—is the toll that can come with being a first responder, because behind those brave faces are everyday people doing extraordinary things to help others. These brave people in our communities see things that most of us will never have to see, and they put themselves in dangerous situations that most of us are lucky to never have to experience. I have no doubt that this can take a toll on anyone's mental health. While we're always grateful for those who are there to help us, we should always be mindful that sometimes those same people need help themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the first responders, I say thank you so much. Thank you for being the people we turn to when we are at the moment of our greatest need. We owe you so much. But I also want to remind you that as a community and as a government, we are here for you. If you need help or support, there are places to go. There is Lifeline, who provides national counselling services, which are available 24 hours a day, seven days week. There is Beyond Blue, who provides national mental health and wellbeing support services, which are also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are many more, such as EAP. Our first responders deserve so much, but they certainly do not deserve to be living with trauma or mental health challenges that could come as a consequence of their actions in risking their lives to help others. If you are a first responder and need help or support, do not hesitate to go out and get it. You have done so much to help others, and there is absolutely no harm or shame in seeking help yourself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Hunter, I would say to all our first responders: thank you. While we are lucky and grateful to have you there to look after us, you have to remember to look after yourself. Keep up the fantastic work. You all do a fantastic job. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you over many more years with what you do, which is selfless work for our community. Thank you so much to all of you. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this very important topic. It's a growing issue that we are facing across the world. I'd like to thank those who'll be speaking on the motion and also Dr Jane Tiller from Monash University, for her passionate efforts to have this issue brought to this parliament's attention and for her research work in advancing this cause nationwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genetic testing provides lifesaving information. It can also provide life-altering information to groups such as insurers and employers et cetera that can be used against individuals and their families, which can impede not only their recovery and the healing process but also their financial wellbeing and even their employment wellbeing. I've seen in my own field of paediatrics an explosion in the ability to diagnose genetic conditions, often to very great benefit. For example, there's a condition called spinal muscular atrophy, which was universally fatal, usually before the age of three, and it's now diagnosable in the neonatal period, and treatment is being offered that is allowing normal development in these children. This is a remarkable improvement. Carrier screening is also being offered to these families. It may enable people to live normal lives when previously they couldn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in spite of the enormous advantages, this information can provide great detriment to people diagnosed with genetic conditions, and the ability to diagnose these conditions is increasing all the time. Insurers can increase premium costs if people are now recognised as having certain genetic conditions, and they're expanding all the time. We're now recognising genetic conditions for sudden death, cardiovascular disease and dementia. We know that these can be used by insurance companies, employers and educators to restrict people's access to employment, benefits and financial success. It's an unfair and an ugly use of genetic testing, and this must be stopped. We should not allow genetic testing results to be used by insurance companies, employers and a whole range of people to discriminate against individuals and their families. No-one can choose their genes, and we've always offered insurance on the basis of community risk, and we've covered people accordingly for things like health insurance et cetera. However, there now is the potential for this information to be used against people's interest, rather than for their benefit. It greatly concerns me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a major concern around the world, and many countries have already legislated to prevent companies using genetic information to discriminate against people. It's important that this parliament acts to protect Australian consumers and people now and into the future. This is why legislative prohibition on insurers using genetic results to discriminate against people is urgently required. It's only through amending legislation to give patients and consumers certainty about the ongoing protection of their genetic information that genetic information can benefit the community. In Canada, legislation completely bans the use of genetic results in any goods or service offering, including insurance. Only if an individual chooses to provide their genetic test results can an insurer or other agencies, such as an employer, act. It's important to stress that it's the individual's choice to release that information. Patient privacy is paramount and must not be shopped around by insurers and risk assessors et cetera. No Australian should be discriminated against due to their genetic test results. I want Australians to have peace of mind about this, and it's important that this parliament acts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Individual health and wellbeing are too important to be sidelined and managed by a group of financiers and insurance agents. Our healthcare system cannot have individuals go without these test results because they're worried about the implications of what might happen to them or their families. And it's important to note that genetic information affects not just the individual but their families, and it's very important that they are protected as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister for health and the Prime Minister for the recent announcement of $66 million to be invested into genomics research, but that should be tempered by an understanding of the risks of those results to people suffering from a number of serious diseases and some chronic conditions. Genomics medicine is revolutionising health care; I've seen that in my own practice, but we must protect people who suffer from these genetic conditions.</span>

It can enable early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disease. From my family's experience, I know that while we all expect that new baby to arrive safely and healthy, sometimes life doesn't follow those plans, and not all families have access to genetic testing before their baby arrives. That's what my family found out. It can take months or, in many cases, years following the birth to obtain a diagnosis for a genetic disorder, particularly if it's incredibly rare. Even when genetic disorders are life-limiting or have a degenerative effect, the earlier you can have an assessment—we're learning every day how important it is to have early intervention and treatment. This can make access to genetic testing, antenatal and postnatal, even more vital.</span>

They help patients understand the risks and benefits of genetic testing and help patients understand what a positive or negative test can mean for them and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final point relates to privacy and the crossroads that Australia is at with respect to the sharing of genetic testing information. As has been pointed out by the member for Macarthur, some Australians feel discouraged by undertaking genetic testing because of potentially adverse implications for life insurance and even employment prospects. I've heard from some people with genetic conditions that their children or other family members are actually deciding to postpone or avoid genetic testing altogether, which is really concerning—notwithstanding the health benefits that testing could bring—until after because of those potential life insurance impacts. This shows how worried people are about the implications of disclosing genetic test results for their careers, for their livelihoods and for insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to enable people to put their health first and only think about the health implications and not the possible financial implications. We need people to embrace genetic testing, which could be life-changing or even life-saving, without being made to disclose the results to potential employers or insurers. In the United Kingdom, there is a moratorium banning the use of genetic testing and underwriting life insurance. However, presently in Australia, the life insurance sector can use genetic test results in underwriting. In 2019, Australia's peak life insurance body implemented only a partial moratorium requiring disclosure of genetic test results above set limits of $500,000 for death or permanent disability and lower limits in other areas. This is not subject to government oversight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the government has released a consultation paper today launching a review of Australia's regulatory framework for the use of genetic testing in life insurance underwriting. A ban would be in line with the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2023 Australian genetics and life insurance moratorium: monitoring the effectiveness and response</span> A-GLIMMER report. I've had the benefit of meeting with Dr Jane Tiller, one of the authors of this report, and Australians impacted by our nation's current lack of a ban on the use of genetic testing and life insurance underwriting. The report shows the lack of certainty for those impacted. I think we are seeing an effect with respect to health implications and people's access to health and medical support without having that safety net. I therefore encourage those with lived experience to participate in this government consultation, which is closing next year on 31 January.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad to hear that the Council of Australian Life Insurers, whose 19 members represent 99 per cent of the life insurance market and all reinsurers, recognise the important role of genetic testing, and I hope to see their full support for moves to ban the use of genetic testing in Australia for life insurance underwriting. This will give Australians greater peace of mind with respect to making these vital decisions. I'd like to close by just mentioning the great work of the member for Macarthur. I think it's fair to say that, through the topics that the member brings to the parliament, his expertise in all areas of medicine, health and ethics has made this parliament and debate richer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I thank the member for Macarthur for moving this important motion. Genetic research is critical in improving the screening, early diagnosis and treatment of Australian patients. Genetics and genomics are reshaping clinical practice and changing the way we prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor a range of heritable conditions, cancer predisposition syndromes and rare cancers. But we know that some people are wary of undergoing genetic testing—they're either postponing or even avoiding it altogether—because of a perceived risk to privacy and the risks to accessing financial products such as life insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genetic testing and its legal implications cover three ministerial portfolios—obviously health, but also the Attorney-General in terms of privacy and Treasury in terms of the impact on the life insurance industry. The Albanese government is committed to the future of genetic research and testing for Australians. This is a health system and scientific frontier focusing on prevention and early intervention, and this is important for the health of Australians. On 18 November 2023, we announced $66 million for genomics research. A total of 25 projects will be funded by the government to conduct genomic research to assist in improving testing and diagnosis for many diseases. Each of these 25 projects will receive up to $3 million through the Medical Research Future Fund's Genomics Health Futures Mission. On 1 November, the Minister for Health and Aged Care announced new listings on the MBS for a range of genetic tests, valued at $148.5 million over the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the government is consulting with states and territories on the development of a nationally cohesive approach to medical genomics, including the establishment of a new national genomics body. The government's consideration of this body will also be informed by an expert advisory group and an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advisory group on health genomics. The Department of Health and Aged Care is monitoring developments in the fields of genetics, genetic testing and participation in medical research, and will continue to support the Treasury and Attorney-General's Department by providing advice on these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the health portfolio, on 28 September 2023 the Australian government released its response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Act </span><span style="font-style:italic;">review</span> report. In its response to the review, the government committed to progressing work to enhance privacy provisions provided to individuals and to ensure Australian businesses have clarity about what information is covered by the Privacy Act and how best to protect this information. The government's response to the Privacy Act review is being led by the Attorney-General's Department. The Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services, the Hon. Stephen Jones MP, is responsible for the regulation of life insurance and is taking the lead on genetic discrimination in life insurance, including external consultation and examination of possible options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to a parliamentary committee report in 2018, the Financial Services Council put a genetics moratorium in place to address disincentives to undertaking a genetic test. This is effectively industry self-regulation for products over a certain value. Monash University's A-GLIMMER report by Dr Jane Tiller measured the impact of the moratorium and was published in June 2023. It called for an amendment to the Disability Discrimination Act to prohibit the use of genetic or genomic test results to discriminate between applicants for risk rated insurance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Assistant Minister Jones has today announced the release of a consultation paper on the use of genetic test results in life insurance underwriting. The consultation paper includes three options: no government intervention; legislating a complete or partial ban—and this would align with the report's recommendation—or legislating financial limits on the use of genetic tests. No-one should be dissuaded from potentially life-saving testing out of fear of discrimination in life insurance products. Australia lags globally on this issue, with some form of prohibition or ban in place in the UK, Canada, Europe, the US and New Zealand. The consultation will close on 31 January 2024, and I encourage those interested in this important issue to put in a submission to the consultation. Thanks again to Dr Jane Tiller, the author of the Monash report, for her ongoing advocacy in this area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  Today we discuss a matter that lies at the intersection of science, health and human rights. In a world where medical breakthroughs continually shape our understanding of disease and health, the field of genetics has, for decades, held great promise but not fully realised its potential, due to problems with equity of access, the absence of an overarching national strategy and the challenges of navigating care, which are all made worse by the tyranny of distance across our vast land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In adult medicine, I saw firsthand how the incorporation of genetic information in tumour typing guided choice of first-line and salvage chemotherapy for a range of tumours, including breast, bowel and haematological malignancies. Patients with blood cancers like leukaemia and lymphoma cycle between clinical trials based on biomarkers in their tumours. I often encountered patients who died not from their leukaemia but from opportunistic infections due to fungal pathogens or dormant viruses triggered by a failing immune system. Surprisingly, however, thanks to targeted immunotherapies, many patients lived years with poor prognostic cancer before the bugs finally caught up with them. Cancer as a chronic disease could become a reality thanks to genomics. The evolving genetic profile of the tumour can be matched to a different treatment regimen, often in a trial context. These patients have access to next-generation sequencing, advanced bioinformatics and cutting-edge treatments, thanks to clinicians and clinical trial teams who are competitive at obtaining funding for research. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How many Australians have access to this level of expertise? In my own electorate, Cabrini Health's Malvern hospital has a state-of-the-art cancer centre and is looking to expand with a $200 million investment in infrastructure. Patients will have their cancers biopsied; staged with CT, MRI or PET; sequenced; and analysed with AI. The patients will undergo surgery if required, be admitted into clinical trials and be provided with treatment either at home or in-house, in the beautiful oncology suite—thanks to the generous support from the Gandel family—with or without radiotherapy provided in the basement by GenesisCare, and the supportive care extends to exercise physiologists undertaking research in the gym downstairs. This is not science fiction; this is already happening: true one-stop care along the disease continuum. How many facilities in Australia can boast this level of care? Somehow, thanks to the smarts and networks of their specialist doctors, these patients are given access to highly specialised medicine. No crowdfunding is required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend Rare Cancers Australia for unpacking, in their <span style="font-style:italic;">Vision 20-30</span> report, what best practice should look like. It describes, in poignant detail, the journeys of several Australians with a parallel future of what should have been. It draws upon multiple domain experts and patient voices to produce something to aspire to. Part of the challenge I see is the fragmentation of our health system, with siloed primary care, hospital care and community care. But <span style="font-style:italic;">Vision 20</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">30</span> shows us ways of overcoming those barriers by putting patients, with their GPs, at the centre, supported by a network of specialist doctors and teams. It does mean stopping the attrition of general practitioners and supporting Medicare with bulk billing. This is why we have introduced a $3.5 billion tripling in the bulk-billing incentive. It absolutely impacts patients who suffer from cancer. We are also trying to arrest the decline in bulk billing and in GPs leaving the profession. We have introduced fee waivers for GP trainees in remote and regional areas and extended funding for longer consultations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the Albanese government is committing $166 million for a first-of-its-kind Australian Cancer Nursing and Navigation Program as part of its support of the recently released landmark Australian Cancer Plan. Cancer nurses will help patients navigate the bewildering complexity of the health system when they are most vulnerable. Patients travelling between specialists, with GPs simply getting the letters—if they're lucky—is neither efficient, affordable nor patient centred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Muddying the waters, of course, is the issue of genetic information and life insurance. Currently, there is no legislation that prohibits the use of genetic information by life insurance companies to deny or increase the cost of cover. This is despite a 2018 parliamentary joint committee report recommending that a ban be implemented. The current limits to consumer protection mean that Australia is not fulfilling the potential of genetic medicine, and this is something that we need to reform. It underscores the importance of the work that is being led currently by Minister Stephen Jones to prevent genetic discrimination entering our lives. An overarching national strategy will help us tie up these loose ends and enable Australians to benefit from the advances of genomics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I thank Dr Freelander for bringing this motion before the parliament and the Australian people. It's good to hear the expertise of the member for Higgins in the speech she just delivered to the House. The government must act to protect patient confidentiality and prevent genetic discrimination. Australia has a distinguished history of innovation in medicine—for example, the electronic pacemaker in 1926, ultrasound in 1961 and the multichannel cochlear implant in the 1970s, which my father's hearing benefited from. This innovative spirit is backed by our nation's global reputation for producing groundbreaking research. This reputation has been hard won over long decades through dedicated scientific inquiry, rigorous research and, above all, adherence to ethical principles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years we've seen increasing research in and accessibility to testing in the field of genetics. This field has the potential to help us take significant steps towards understanding the nature of genetically linked diseases—diseases like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's. In addition, this field has the potential to help us develop personalised prevention and treatment strategies, which would be a game changer for thousands of people across the world. Imagine for a moment, though, a patient who has had genetic testing done, whether it be for research or for personal preventative health measures, then being penalised by insurers for taking this step, through high premiums, lower insurance levels or not being able to access insurance at all. That becomes a deterrent to being tested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Progress in the field of genetic medicine should not come at the cost of breaching the fundamental principles of privacy and confidentiality for individual patients. We must ask ourselves: are we truly committed to improving the health of this nation? If so, are we truly committed to protecting the rights of our citizens to privacy, confidentiality and the protection of their medical information? These are fundamental human rights. Australia's international human rights obligations demand that we do not discriminate on the basis of genetics. Article 6 of the UN's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights requires a prohibition on discrimination based on genetic characteristics. Article 25 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities specifically refers to discrimination in the offer of life insurance. Meanwhile, Australia's Disability Discrimination Act 1992 prohibits discrimination based on genetic status. However, there is an exemption for insurers if an underwriting decision is based on reasonable data. How is that fair? How does that protect the confidentiality and freedom from discrimination of everyday Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is lagging behind our Commonwealth partners in numerous countries around the globe. Both Canada and the UK protect the genetic information of individuals more than we do and have taken significant steps to prohibit the use of genetic test results in life, income-protection, and critical-illness insurance. A review by the Geneva Association showed that 13 of the 20 listed countries protected the disclosure of genetic results to insurers in any circumstance. Australia is not part of that group. Who would have thought, in 2023, that Australia would lag behind the world on the protection of confidential patient information and the prevention of genetic discrimination? This nation needs to, first and foremost, protect the privacy of Australians, eliminate genetic discrimination and give people confidence to be tested so that they can participate in research and remove the barrier to Australia providing targeted health measures in future planning. The first action must be to remove the exemption of insurers in the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Regardless, our Commonwealth, state and territory governments must work towards protecting the confidential genetic information and prohibiting genetic discrimination of the Australian people. I cannot make the case more clearly than I have today on behalf of the people of Australia. Big business may not like this, but I am still here about this nation's people.</span>

When I was a youngling doctor, ordering standard chromosomal testing was about the limit of what we could do. We can now routinely test for genetic changes on blood, cheek swabs, saliva samples, tumours, chorionic villi and amniotic fluid. We can even test for changes in fetal cells derived from a mother's bloodstream. Clinicians can now order whole genome sequencing from clinic with a few mouse clicks. I was fortunate, during my previous career as a paediatric neurologist, to be involved in identification of the genes responsible for 11 neurological conditions and to lead some of the first gene and genetic therapy trials in this country. Those technological advances were unthinkable when the member for Macarthur and I were medical students several centuries ago. But, as always with rapid advances in clinical medicine, it's really important that we examine all aspects of impact—both cost and benefit—in building the case for scalable, sustainable and equitable genetic and genomic health care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant challenges locally with access to genetic testing services in Australia. I recently met with my colleagues Professor Stephen O'Leary, Lilian Downie and Valerie Sung, who are representatives of the Childhood Hearing Australasian Medical Professionals network. They also work at the University of Melbourne, Royal Women's Hospital and the MCRI. They told me about their concerns regarding federally funded genetic testing. The Medical Services Advisory Committee recently approved new item numbers for genetic testing for hearing loss in children and for adults with hearing loss, but they allotted fees significantly lower than those recommended by the experts. Because the rebate offered is below the cost of the test, the few qualified Australian laboratories have been unable to offer this genetic testing. This problem, while vexatious, is not unique; rebates offered for testing of other conditions are often funded below levels that make it possible for labs to offer the test. When these investigators requested review of the MSAC decision, they were told that not only would they not get an answer for the disparity in the funding but they would have to file a whole new application if they wanted it reviewed. Those clinicians have been let down by the system. It lacks accountability, it lacks transparency and it lacks clarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also previously spoken in this House about the issues around life insurance and the fear of genetic discrimination in this country. Earlier this year, I spoke to a motion from my colleague the member for Macnamara regarding that the government act by amending the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 as it applies to genetic results. This morning the government has announced a consultation period regarding options for regulatory interventions into the insurance industry. While recognising the stresses upon our insurance industry, which are manifold—particularly given the increasing impact of climate change—we do need to ensure that concerns around the potential impact on insurability don't dissuade people from undergoing important genetic testing. It can have an impact on not only their medical care but also their family members. We have to guard against adverse selection—where people, knowing that they have a genetic disease, seek cover that they would not otherwise obtain—but we also have to ensure that individuals are not deterred from potentially life-saving genetic testing and from participation in genetic research. I look forward to working with all of my constituents on suggestions regarding these possible regulatory changes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the federal government's Department of Health and Aged Care's capability review identified the need for us to be on the front foot in the revolution in genomics. The government recently announced $66 million for genomics research by the MRFF, but, as is often with the case with the MRFF, we don't have a vision for all aspects of this research and the basis for funding allocations. I do support calls not only for a national genomics strategy but also for an overarching diagnostics advisory group, which will not only improve genetic and genomic diagnosis in this country but also establish a road map for all aspects of our healthcare diagnostics and treatments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important motion. It concerns Services Australia, which is often the most critical government department and is the interface between many Australians and the federal government. It delivered over $200 billion in payments and services to Australia. Therefore, its performance, and the performance of the minister who is overseeing this department, after 18 months is critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I want to note that the release of Services Australia's 2022-23 annual report has unfortunately confirmed that customer satisfaction and other key performance measures to do with this agency have in fact gone backwards. Secondly, Services Australia has become a basket case under the current government, with skyrocketing wait times for calls and claims processing. Thirdly, it's been shown that, after 18 months, the Minister for Government Services has in fact reduced Services Australia's average staffing levels in the 2023-24 budget and decreased funding for technology and transformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we go through the agency's 2022-23 annual report, it does not make for good reading. First of all, the agency has failed to meet key performance targets, particularly around customer satisfaction—that is, where customers are served within 15 minutes. Work processes within timeliness standards and call wait times—all of these measures have gone backwards. Call wait times are a particularly acute area of failure. In 2021-22, over half of the customers who called social security and welfare were answered in 15 minutes. In 2022-23, under the Labor government—under Minister Shorten—only 36 per cent were answered within 15 minutes, and new data obtained by the opposition in Senate estimates now reveals that the wait time has blown out to 53 minutes and 26 seconds on average. That's almost an hour of being on hold for Australians trying to deal with Services Australia. This is simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not Services Australia; this is 'dis-Services Australia' or 'no-Services Australia'. Call wait times, particularly, are getting worse because of this government's ideological crusade against outsourced labour, and, in that regard, we learnt midyear that a major call centre contract with Serco had been axed, with 600 jobs for people answering phones cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Claim-processing time is another key performance measure that has also skyrocketed under Labor. My electorate office continues to receive calls and emails for help from worried constituents trying to deal with Services Australia. We know from data disclosed by Minister Bill Shorten that claims-processing times have been lost. From July last year to August this year, it took on average 98 days for a childcare subsidy related payment to be processed, 61 days for the age pension to be processed and 80 days for the disability support pension to be processed. This is simply not good enough—absolutely not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly, we saw that the minister did call for a review of myGov. It's a plain fact that most Australians prefer to interact with Services Australia via digital means. For every face-to-face transaction in 2022-23, there were 110 online transactions. MyGov is Australia's single largest authenticated digital platform. At the moment, though, it's a cumbersome and difficult platform. The minister did have an audit of myGov and got the results in January, and it wasn't until November that the minister announced that he will make some changes—and I do applaud him for this. He's engaged former New South Wales Liberal minister the Hon. Victor Dominello, who will be taking up the reins at myGov and hopefully transforming myGov in the way that he did in New South Wales. I do commend the minister for pulling across a New South Wales Liberal to assist with this transformation, but digital transformation at Services Australia must be a major priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the longer term, improving digital engagement saves taxpayers money, saves their time and improves overall agency efficiency. But the minister must now have a full review of Services Australia to increase these efficiencies, and I call for that today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  There are a few things I want to say in response to not just the motion but the comments that were just made in the Federation Chamber. The first is around outsourcing and around the contract with Serco. If you deep dive into the experiences of both those who worked for Serco and the people who were directly employed within Centrelink, it is quite alarming. Quite often the people working for Serco received very little training before they were put onto the phones. We have a service centre in my electorate. Our local Centrelink and combined services office, where they do a lot of processing—what we used to call a smart centre—had to work closely with Serco. We also had some Serco workers. They received two days of training on our very complex social security law. How can you possibly support people when they ring Centrelink if you've only had two days of training?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The experience that got reported to us from people working directly for Centrelink was quite often that the Serco people, because they hadn't received the training, were giving out the wrong information, or they couldn't answer the call, so that person was being put back on hold. Technically, it might have appeared that your call was being answered within 15 minutes, but it wasn't being resolved. You were quite often put on hold or referred on, given the wrong information and having to call back. Outsourcing within Centrelink does not work. We need properly trained, directly employed Australians to answer and help support Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to change the culture within Centrelink, and I applaud the minister for going down that path. The idea that Australians accessing their social security and support services like Centrelink and Medicare are called 'customers'—they're not purchasing things. They're Australians. They could be clients. They are people seeking support and accessing what are their rights. This idea of customer culture that we've focused on is the wrong direction for our Centrelink. I want to acknowledge the efforts that the minister is making to change the culture: direct employment, less casualisation, and giving people the jobs they can rely upon into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's also look at the workload that Centrelink have had since we came to office. This is something. It is a knock-on effect of having a progressive Labor government that is reforming our social security to support people. We have had some big changes happen since the last budget, and that has created more work for our Centrelink staff in particular and for our Services Australia staff. More families are now eligible for the family tax benefit, paid parental leave and the childcare subsidy. The agency processed almost 1.1 million claims from January to 16 November 2023. This is the workload that our agency has. The agency has received 7.9 per cent more families claiming in 2023 than it did for the same period last year. This is because our government has moved down a path of supporting more families, so the workload has increased. The change in eligibility for the parenting payment came into effect on 20 September, resulting in 65,000-plus people transitioning from the JobSeeker payment and youth allowance payment onto the parenting payment. All of this extra, progressive reform, which this parliament supported and which we support, has created extra work. These are just some of the many areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I also want to acknowledge, in the moments I have left, is the great work of our Services Australia staff, who, quite honestly, are hanging on in there. In the last decade, we have lost a lot of good people from Services Australia to the state system because their pay and conditions have not kept up. That's a real shame that we've lost talented, experienced people from Services Australia to our state agencies literally because the pay rates aren't the same. Our government is looking at that parity because we want to have the best people working for the public and supporting some of the most vulnerable people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to the people working in my electorate and, in particular, the specialists working in areas like aged care that have gone back to face-to-face appointments to help people navigate what is a very complex system. Our Services Australia staff are amazing. They forgo a lot to work to support our community and they deserve our thanks.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I congratulate the member for Hughes for moving this motion which calls on the government to get Services Australia back on track, because every day we see evidence that Services Australia is in very bad shape and is not serving Australians, serving customers, as it should. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, there was a new revelation that there had been a major technology bungle at Services Australia which resulted in around 11,000 vulnerable Australians having their superannuation incorrectly assessed when they reached the age pension age. The opposition had to work very hard to get the details of this. After I lodged a freedom of information request, the Minister for Government Services initially refused it, and the agency is still saying that there are around 7,100 customer records yet to be remediated. This is just one of many, many instances we have seen of a very serious problem at Services Australia. It's a cultural problem which has been driven from the top down by the minister, the member for Maribyrnong, who'd rather spend his time playing political games, blocking transparency and scrutiny, than focusing on improving customer service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to disagree very strongly with the previous Labor speaker, who rejected the idea that Australians, in engaging with Services Australia, should be treated as customers. The coalition disagrees very strongly with that. There needs to be a customer service mentality at Services Australia, and we are seeing the very opposite from this government. There's an ideological crusade against the use of specialist providers, which led to specialist call centre provider Serco being axed in the middle of this year. Now, I've got no particular brief for Serco, but it is absolutely clear that, when you use specialised providers with particular expertise, you get better outcomes on metrics that are used all across the private sector, such as call waiting times. In the period from 1 July to the end of August this year, it has taken almost an hour on average for an Australian to get through to Centrelink's employment services line. Why? Because of those ideologically driven decisions by this Labor government that puts customer service right down the bottom of the list of priorities, as we just heard from the member for Bendigo, and instead puts the union objectives right up the top of the pile. It's no surprise that the current minister, a former union official, has failed to inculcate a strong customer focused culture at Services Australia because this concept is entirely foreign to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One other thing that is very foreign to him is the fact that customers of Services Australia and of businesses, large and small, around the country are showing a very clear preference to engage through a digital channel. They find it quicker and more convenient. For every one face-to-face engagement with Services Australia in 2022-23, there were 110 digital transactions. That compares to 70 to one in 2015. That's a very clear trend, and that mirrors the trends we're seeing in the way that Australians are engaging with private sector providers—for example, the number of ATMs. In August 2021, ATMs were used 24 million times by Australians. That's down from 71 million in July 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians expect the same digital services efficiencies from their government as they do from the businesses that they are engaging with. That was something that was a real focus of the previous coalition government. We created myGov ID. We created the corresponding trusted digital identity framework. By contrast, under this government, we've learned through Senate estimates that a federal-state digital credential sharing agreement between the Australian and New South Wales governments has now completely broken down. In February, the minister said that this work would be completed by August or September. It's now late November. It's nowhere to be seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is yet another of the current minister's dismal failures. It illustrates the lack of reform, energy and commitment from this government and from this minister when it comes to digital service delivery. Funding for technology and transformation as a line item in the budget is going backwards over the forward estimates, and that failure to enhance digital service delivery is also a failure of customer service. This minister is ignoring the proven capacity of digital technology to improve customer service.</span>

The 2022-23 Services Australia report revealed an agency left crippled by a decade of coalition cuts and neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin my response to this motion by recognising the 30,000 or so staff that work at Services Australia. Near my electorate office in Greenway are the headquarters of Services Australia and the Department of Social Services, and many of those staff are my constituents. In Tuggeranong and Woden I have two great Services Australia centres. The staff are professionals with decades of experience. They are passionate Commonwealth employees. They've dedicated their careers to serving Australians most in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years ago these workers were sidelined and silenced when those opposite came to power. They were forced to watch as sensitive and vital face-to-face work was contracted to outside organisations and valuable skill sets and knowledge were ripped from their agency. Those workers continue to live with the consequences of those cuts. The legacy in those agencies is the continued loss of talent and brain drain and the overworked, underpaid and underappreciated frontline staff with growing caseloads. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade, the former government decimated Services Australia's front line to make way for malicious, profit-making programs like robodebt. People were an afterthought at both ends of that program. This Labor government says 'no more and never again'. The Albanese government has agreed, in full or in principle, to all 56 recommendations of the royal commission into the coalition robodebt scandal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key recommendations of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme outlined that the government should facilitate 'easy and efficient engagement, with options of online, in-person and telephone communication which is sensitive to the particular circumstances of the customer cohort'. This is why the government is making an immediate $228 million funding injection to frontline and service delivery staffing at the agency this financial year. It's only by funding the return of people to government services, to have a people centred approach and get away from the robosystems beloved by the last government, that we can ensure robodebt never happens again. The new staff will be critical to reducing call wait times, speeding up claim payments and giving Australians back some time in their busy lives. Services Australia will be bringing on the staff as quickly as possible, with more than 800 Australians already accepting jobs at the agency. This announcement comes at a time when Services Australia has fewer public servants per capita than at any other time, as a result of the former government gutting staff at the agency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government didn't keep up to pace in supporting Australians who rely on critical government services. They defunded Services Australia, they reduced its staffing numbers and they negotiated underwhelming industrial agreements. They created the very conditions which they are now criticising. We know that when people are waiting a long time for their claims to be processed they turn to the phones to seek answers. This is unfortunately adding to call centre traffic, meaning more people aren't getting through. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I discussed earlier, we must facilitate easy and efficient engagement options of all types. That's why we're also strengthening and enhancing online access via myGov. In the 2023 budget, the government committed to investing a total of $134 million to sustain improvements in this area as well. This government understands that Australians in need of support from their government should be able to seek assistance in an easy, timely and human manner. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  There are some motions where you read through and do a bit of a double-take on some elements of them. I must say that in this place we're used to self-congratulatory motions from those opposite on their time in government. There's no time for any self reflection or introspection after the last election loss; it's all motion after motion saying how amazing it was. Times were never better, apparently! But this one takes the cake. Apparently, Services Australia and service delivery were 'seamless, simple and safe' during their decade in power. It just occurred to me: was it seamless, simple and safe when 3,800 frontline staff were being gutted from Services Australia? Was it seamless, simple and safe when people were being subjected to robodebt letters and all the unnecessary stress and illegality of that? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read one paragraph from the robodebt royal commission to see whether they found that, under the previous government, these kinds of operations were seamless, simple and safe. The royal commission found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals. In essence, people were traumatised on the off-chance they might owe money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we know, so many people who were sent those traumatising letters weren't in a position where they owed money. This is the situation that we saw under the previous government. It took a royal commission that this government instituted to uncover so much of that, and then those opposite come into this place with a self-congratulatory motion to say how wonderful things were. How absolutely ridiculous! In terms of putting some of the services that this government is providing into context and some of the investments that this government is making into Services Australia, I want to make a few additional observations—in addition to observing how ridiculous the motion is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, as previous speakers on this side have indicated, there are many areas where Services Australia's workload has increased substantially, which is a reflection of the fact that there are many people receiving benefits who previously weren't and many areas of the operation of government where people are getting assistance because they're doing it tough in the current environment, where there are cost-of-living pressures being put on the economy through external international pressures. For example, the agency has received over 80,000 more family claims as at 16 November 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. There have also been changes to the eligibility for parenting payment single that came into effect on 20 September, which resulted in over 65,000 customers transitioning from JobSeeker payments and Youth Allowance to parenting payments on 6 October. There are others. For example, from 4 September, a mailout of 1.4 million rent statements occurred advising customers of changed entitlements or action needed following increases to rent assistance—</span>

                  </a>  As I was indicating, the work of Services Australia has increased substantially as a result of a number of the measures that this government has put in place to support those who are most vulnerable when it comes to those cost-of-living pressures that are being experienced and that have been imposed on our economy by international, external forces. I also want to make the point that this government is putting on significant extra staff, investing in Services Australia and reversing some of the staff cuts that we saw under the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to add that Services Australia has done so much in recent times when it comes to providing support for those experiencing hardship as a result of natural disasters. In 2023-24, this government invested a significant amount—over $230 million—to establish a cost-effective emergency capability. I saw this firsthand in my own electorate in the suburb of Maribyrnong and some surrounding suburbs when people were affected by floods in 2022. I saw that people were able to access the Services Australia portal that was put up by that government department and access emergency payments very, very quickly—within just an hour or two of submitting their application. This showed me how important it is for those people in the absolute most dire need that our IT services and that our staff are there. Services Australia also had staff on deck in that suburb to provide people with face-to-face advice. So Services Australia does an amazing job, and this government is investing in it so that it can do even more after 10 years of being gutted. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll start off by saying that we stand on the brink of a new era, where the future is not merely a distant vision but a tangible reality—a future made in Australia. It is a future that will be forged through innovation, driven by resilience and built on the pillars of opportunity and inclusion. This government believes in creating pathways for every Australian to access the jobs of tomorrow. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is ready to support the transformative power of technology and innovation. We aim to foster an environment where 1.2 million tech-related jobs by 2030 become a reality, empowering individuals and propelling our economy forward. We understand the urgency of the skills crisis gripping our nation. Digital skills are essential to jobs across industries now and into the future. That's why this government announced the Digital and Tech Skills Working Group to take forward the compact, for industry, government and unions to work together. The working group outlined an earn-while-you-learn model, to support workers entering the tech industry to take on entry-level tech roles through a blend of employment and formal training, and includes how such models could support diversity in the existing tech-related workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is considering the working group's advice. To support this progress we've introduced free-fee TAFE, bridging the skills gap to inspire and upskill Australians towards crucial sectors such as agriculture, care, construction, technology, space innovation and defence. Yet opposition voices continue to neglect the transformative impact of successful education and training. This government understands that investing in our people is an investment in our nation's future. By collaborating across sectors we're ensuring that the workforce is equipped to thrive in a digitally-driven world. We're not just creating jobs. We're fostering diversity in STEM fields, making sure the voices of women and Indigenous communities are heard loud and clear. These groups have been underrepresented for far too long. </span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, voted against by the opposition, is our cornerstone for manufacturing. It is a foundation upon which industries will flourish, creating secure, well-paid jobs and driving economic growth. This week, with the launch of the Industry Growth Program, we welcome a new chapter for SMEs, providing the means for ideas to materialise, innovations to thrive and businesses to grow. It was this government that closed the deal on the Technology Safeguards Agreement with the US. This agreement is a big deal for the Australian space sector, for the launch sector and for supporting services like transport and logistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a proud South Australian and the member for Adelaide, I've watched as this industry has grown and grown, starting with the thriving hub for space innovation in the heart of my electorate. I take every opportunity to get out there and hear about the sector from experts, with over 90 space organisations in the electorate of Adelaide. We know that, for many young Australians, space is an inspiring gateway to study and to work. That's why it was incredibly exciting that Katherine Bennell-Pegg, an employee of the Australian Space Agency, became the first Australian-born woman to represent our nation in astronaut training with the European Space Agency. Through role models like Katherine, we can encourage more of our young people to pursue STEM related careers. We're not just shaping the future; we're shaping a future made for everyone—an inclusive, innovative and prosperous Australia. The choice is clear. This government stands for progress while the opposition lingers in the shadows of missed opportunities. Let us build, let us innovate and let us propel Australia into a future where possibilities are boundless and opportunities are limitless.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  This motion is very important. The goal of 1.2 million tech related jobs by 2030 is a noble and important one. Unfortunately, making a commitment is the first step, but having and delivering a plan to do that is the most important step. There are some things that this government needs to do to make sure we can deliver these 1.2 million tech related jobs. The first is to appoint a minister for the digital economy. A minister for the digital economy will do two important things: firstly, it will send a signal to the industry, to the market and to investors that the government is serious about this industry and these opportunities; and, secondly—and crucially—it will develop the strategy needed to make sure we have a plan. The former government had a minister for the digital economy and a 2030 strategy that was being implemented to make a difference. I continue to call on the government to appoint a minister for the digital economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other things that could be done that aren't being done. Again, with this government you hear a lot of announcements, but it's low on delivery. Not a dollar has been committed to get the Digital and Tech Skills Compact, which those opposite have talked about, off the ground. There was no line item in either the October 2022 or the May 2023 budget. Talking about how important it is is one thing, but putting the money behind it to get it up and running is crucial, and there is no money from this government for the Digital and Tech Skills Compact in the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Microcredentials are crucial when we are talking about upskilling Australians in the tech sector. In 2021, the former coalition had the Job-ready Graduates Package, which included $4.2 million for the microcredentials marketplace. We don't hear anything from this government about microcredentials, but it is crucial when it comes to tech and innovation. Let's use cyber as an example, but I could use any other industry in the tech sector. The reality is that many of the jobs in cyber that are needed today didn't exist when I graduated 15 years ago or when others graduated 15 to 20 years ago. If we want those people to re-skill, they do not have the ability to spend four years out of the marketplace, because they've got homes, families and financial commitments. Microcredentials allow them to get and continue to build the skills that they need to then work in these tech companies. It is something that is crucial for innovation and for getting these tech related jobs up and running.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite will talk about the National Quantum Strategy, which was announced in May. But, again, there is no new funding for this strategy; there is no action at all. We're seeing the trend, whether it's AI, which I'll get to, or whether it's quantum, where there are a lot of announcements, but there's no money behind them and there's no action, which is frustrating industry. AI is a great example of where there is a lot of talk by this government. The minister in February this year at the AFR Workforce Summit said that they would develop a national strategy on AI. We're about to enter December, and it's crickets from this government around AI. They released a discussion paper. Disappointingly, with that discussion paper, its scope talked about the risks of AI—which we need to mitigate—but did not include looking at the opportunities that AI brings. At a time when productivity is falling through the floor, how can we not look at the opportunities for productivity in the economy and for business through AI? It's December, and we've heard nothing from this government, and industry is frustrated. Industry has had to resort to using the EU legislation and regulations on AI because it knows that they're as tough and as hard as they can get. So they work off that platform and they know that they should, hopefully, be safe into the future. This is the reality. We're asking businesses to invest in jobs, in innovation and in AI, without having any certainty around the requirements from the government. They will talk a lot about the importance of this, but they're not delivering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll quickly finish by talking about the National Reconstruction Fund. I do notice, with the motion from those opposite, that there has been a cut. The $15 billion has been cut to $1.5 billion, so I'm assuming the Treasurer signed off on that, showing a bit more economic responsibility. It is off budget, so I'm surprised he's cut it to $1.5 billion. Again, there's a big announcement by those opposite but nothing's happening. I was talking to someone who should qualify for the National Reconstruction Fund and is looking for capital. He said: 'Nothing's been done. I've got no clarity. It's two to three years before I can even look at the National Reconstruction Fund.' They talk a big game around tech and digital, but they are not delivering anything for the industry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of this motion. The previous speaker was complaining about no money. Honestly—there was $392 million in the Industry Growth Program to support Australian small and medium-sized enterprises to commercialise their ideas and grow their businesses, and there were billions of dollars announced in relation to the National Reconstruction Fund to help Australia capture new, high-value market opportunities, and the member opposite voted against it in parliament! Don't complain about the fact that there's no money there, when you actually voted against the allocation of the money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Adelaide. You only have to walk past his office here in Canberra to see the iconic South Australian Rossi boots proudly displayed in the window. That's a company that was formed in 1910, and I thank the member for Adelaide for what he's done.    Historically, Adelaide was a manufacturing powerhouse, although the former coalition government did its best to kill a lot of that by gutting the car industry, for example, goading it to leave, which is exactly what the car industry did. Who can forget the statements of Joe Hockey, the former Treasurer and member for North Sydney? I was there and so were you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we want to see a future made in Australia. We believe it should be a country that makes things again. The fact is we have all the ingredients here. We've got the people, the capability and the natural resources to compete with the best in the world to produce new products, technology and research. We've hit the ground running, putting in place programs and reforms to diversify our economy, boost our sovereign capability and create a new pipeline of well-paid jobs now and in the future, especially in outer suburban and regional communities like mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, the new $392 million Industry Growth Program, which the Minister for Industry and Science announced this morning, is delivering advice and capital support for small firms to help turn ideas into growing businesses. The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund—that was the amount announced in the parliament and in the bill that we passed—is a co-investment fund that's about adding value to our natural strengths and comparative advantages across seven national priorities, through a mix of loans, guarantees and equity injections. We're committing a huge amount of money across that space. We released Australia's first National Quantum Strategy to support an industry estimated to be worth $2.2 billion, directly employing 8,700 people by 2030. We're working on the National Robotics Strategy, driving an industry that's already contributing $18 billion to our economy. We're looking to support the safe, inclusive uptake of technologies like AI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To unlock the potential of the NRF, we need to tackle current skills shortages and skill up the digital tradies of the future. To that end we're investing heavily in fee-free TAFE. We want Australians to take the opportunity to get the skills, including in the priority areas of technology and digital. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition described our fee-free TAFE places as wasteful spending. A total of 215,000 Australians took it up within six months, and we've committed ourselves, from January next year, to another 300,000 places. We're going to make sure people in the outer suburbs of major cities and places like Ipswich in my electorate have the tools to access the jobs of the future in industry and manufacturing. We know when we add value we create jobs and stronger businesses. That's exactly why programs like the NRF and the Industry Growth Program exist—to support those great local businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Capral, in my electorate, is a world-leading firm and a terrific example of this. It was great to have taken Minister Ed Husic on a tour of their factory at Bundamba a few months ago. Capral produces aluminium for a wide range of products, both for local customers and for export, from window frames to truck beds. The thing is aluminium will also be important in our transition to a net zero future. It's used in frames found in the solar panels being installed across the country. Another example is Graphene Manufacturing Group, based in Richlands—in the Speaker's electorate of Oxley, the neighbouring electorate to mine—an innovative firm at the forefront of our national critical minerals and Australian-made battery industry. This site employs over 40 people and is experimenting to develop batteries that charge 70 times faster and have three times the battery life of lithium batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, medical science is a huge growth industry in my electorate. For example, developers like Springfield City Group in Ipswich have been working with a wide range of partners to develop the Springfield BioPark, an innovative precinct dedicated to advanced manufacturing of high-value medicines like vaccine and blood products. So there's a lot going on. We've taken initiative, and those opposite should get on board.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I am very passionate about a future made in Australia, which is in the terms of the motion before us. But, regrettably, I am in a great state of fear about one of the most exciting future industry opportunities in this country, and that is continuous naval shipbuilding centred in my home city of Adelaide. We've heard very frightening rumours in our media about the Hunter Class Frigate Program being potentially on the chopping block. The High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Stephen Smith—who also undertook the Defence Strategic Review—apparently claimed at an event in London that the program should be scaled back dramatically and possibly even acquired out of Glasgow shipyards instead of Adelaide shipyards. There will be no future made in Australia if this government isn't committed to continuous naval shipbuilding in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity has been there for the defence minister, the Prime Minister and others to rule out ridiculous speculation of purchasing significant naval capital vessels from other shipyards outside Australia. The silence has been absolutely deafening, and it is very concerning that it seems clear the government is considering dramatic changes to the naval shipbuilding program here in Australia, centred in my home city of Adelaide. It would be very easy to rule out any of these wild rumours and claims, but the fact that they're not being ruled out unfortunately seems to confirm that they are under active consideration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Naval shipbuilding is one of the most complex industry sectors. It is absolutely at the forefront of future technology. The skills acquired in the naval shipbuilding sector, and in the defence sector more broadly, are extremely interchangeable with other exciting future industries—space and cyber. Space has been gutted. This government has ripped money out of investing in space, with satellites cancelled et cetera. The space sector is completely reeling because, under the previous government, we established the Australian Space Agency—which, of course, is headquartered in my home city of Adelaide—and we had an enormous program around investing in space and space technology but the new government has ripped all of that away. So 'a future made in Australia', while we're ripping money out of the space sector and putting a huge question mark over continuous shipbuilding in this country, is an oxymoron.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most concerning to me is the AUKUS submarine program. I am a huge supporter of acquiring nuclear propulsion technology for the Navy, but it's vitally important that we're building those submarines and that we have that sovereign capability in Australia. What seems clear now is that the government will not commit to any form of minimum content—local industry content—in submarines, and there are claims and brags coming out of the UK that they expect to build these nuclear submarines all up in Barrow-in-Furness for the Royal Australian Navy. We already know the government has conceded that the first few submarines will probably be purchased from the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, for the future AUKUS submarine as it's developed, we know that this government is spending billions of dollars to upgrade shipyards in the United States and the United Kingdom and putting billions of dollars into these programs to help them build submarines. If it were to transpire that the Australian taxpayer was paying the English to develop a capability to build submarines for us in lieu of our own workforce doing it here in Australia, that would be absolutely scandalous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're here to debate a motion about future industry and a future made in Australia, but I fear that the most significant, complex production in the history of this country—a nuclear submarine—is at risk if this government doesn't make very clear the minimum content and what's going to happen in Australia. It's at risk of possibly drifting through to being produced somewhere else. That would be absolutely scandalous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to invite the government to commit to what they promised at the last election when it comes to continuous shipbuilding in Australia. We should be building frigates out at Osborne, with the Hunter program through BAE, and we should be building offshore patrol vessels at Henderson in Western Australia. There's a question mark over that now, and there are suggestions that we will possibly be acquiring vessels out of Spain, from Navantia. Walking away from those commitments is absolutely disgraceful, and we want to see some guarantees in this debate that those jobs are going to be right here in Australia so that we will have a future made in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  In the last sitting week, the minister for infrastructure announced infrastructure funding cuts of more than $220 million in my seat of Mayo and redirected those funds to Labor seats. Consequently, the most significant infrastructure investment in Mayo in more than two decades has had an axe taken to it by what I feel is a very city-centric government in a very city-centric move. These cuts are going to dramatically affect my community in the areas around Verdun and also Mount Barker. The Verdun interchange was built in 1974. It is nearly 50 years old. It is a one-way interchange and desperately needs an upgrade. Hahndorf is the second most visited town in Australia. It struggles with vehicle traffic being funnelled through the main street and now has been denied a solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister and the government have shown a complete lack of understanding and respect for my regional community and, I would say, regional Australia more broadly. Given the disproportionate amount of major accidents and fatalities that occur on regional roads, our regional roads need investment. To move funding across Australia into metropolitan areas is, I think, atrocious. I will now lead a delegation to Canberra and urge the minister to reconsider these cuts because they are unfair, antiregional and simply dangerous.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I rise to speak on behalf of Edgar Stirling, aged 14, who wrote this speech. Edgar is not a seasoned politician but a student, and he wrote this important speech with regard to mental illness because he knows that, as it is part of his own family and part of his schoolmate's, it is a battle that many people face. He says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Our mental health system needs urgent attention. In Australia, adults access care easier than teenagers, despite 1 in 7 adolescents facing mental illness. The youth are resolute in demanding reform. We must allocate resources, enact meaningful policies, and bring about tangible change in our system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So, what steps are vital to fix these issues across states and territories?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, we must support gradually deteriorating patients who aren't in a critical state. Funds for respite recovery programs will offer them much needed care. Proactive interventions before disaster can prevent future crises.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Improving mental health clinics is also vital. Funding for infrastructure will reduce the wait time for clinic beds, which can currently be days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our schools deserve attention as well. Mental health resources and counsellors should be available in government schools, to provide students with strategies to deal with problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Within our mental health system, inaction is not an option. Let's act now, for the sake of future generations who deserve a safer childhood.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Edgar, I say to you: thank you for your advocacy and thank you for your words. We must continue to improve the mental health of all Australians, especially our young people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  The scenes over recent weeks in the Levant have been heartbreaking. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed, including thousands upon thousands of children. Forty-eight per cent of people living in the Gaza Strip are children. They are not responsible for the actions of Hamas and should not be sieged and indiscriminately bombarded by Israeli government air strikes. Innocent civilians of any age cannot be held responsible for war crimes committed by their governments. The Greens condemn the war crimes of Hamas and of the Israeli government, because nothing can justify the violence that we have seen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People around the world are taking to the streets in the largest antiwar movement in a generation to call for a ceasefire and an end to the invasion and occupation. It is unacceptable that the government refuses to hear these calls. Peace cannot and will not be achieved through endless violence and the destruction of Palestine. History has shown us time and again that that only serves to radicalise. Instead of backing the invasion, Australia should be part of an international push for peace and de-escalation. That means a lasting ceasefire, an end to the invasion of Gaza, the release of hostages and political prisoners, an end to the illegal settlement and expansion in the West Bank and the holding of those who have committed war crimes to account. What we will not do here at home is use these horrific acts to whip up antisemitism, Islamophobia or anti-Palestinian racism. We need a lasting and just peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.</span>

I would like to thank the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Murray Watt, who updated us on the federal funding for fuel load reduction in Mitcham and Adelaide Hills, and also the SA minister for emergency services, Joe Szakacs, who told us that the two new quick-response vehicles funded by the federal government are in the heavy-vehicle purchase plan for Sturt Country Fire Service Group this year. </span>

Holly McCoy and Dale Thompson from CFS talked about bushfire attack levels—how they are calculated and what they mean. Fuel load level, slope, wind speed and temperature can all come together to make an unstoppable fire. Preparation is everything. When we get to catastrophic days, or there's an active fire in your area, it's too late. Fuel load reduction, planting your garden with fire retardant natives and having a bushfire plan are all vital for survival. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  It's been a difficult year for young Australians looking to buy or rent a home, and the threats of further interest rate rises and continued high immigration levels are doing nothing to allay those fears. For those looking to buy a home or to get into the housing market, the situation is dire. Labor's inability to tame inflation as well as other advanced economies have means that the price of everything here has gone up and your ability to save a deposit has gone down. Even when your pay check rises, high inflation means your real wages are going backwards; you're getting paid more, but you can afford less. The RBA has confirmed that inflation is now driven by domestic factors—by government decisions. When Labor increase spending by $188 billion, they fuel inflation, making it harder for you to save a deposit. And if you have a deposit, higher interest rates are making it harder to afford mortgage repayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For renters, the situation is just as bad. Whilst responsibility for the housing supply shortage rests with state and local governments, Labor's approach to immigration is hurting young renters. In the middle of a housing crisis, with vacancy levels in cities like Toowoomba below one per cent and new housing approvals at record lows, Labor increased immigration to an all-time high of 500,000 people in the 12 months leading up to September. Want to know why your rents keep going up? A big part of that is because the government continues to drive demand. Immigration numbers need to be reduced. This policy is hurting young Australians. Whether you're buying or renting, I ask you: are you better off today than you were when Labor came into government? Whether it's driving inflation or driving immigration, Labor have only made the situation worse. I hope that we can begin a very sensible conversation on reducing Australia's immigration levels while this housing crisis continues.</span>

I was pleased to take to the stage to join Santa and Rudolph for a rendition of 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas'. That will be live on Facebook later this week. This event is one of my personal favourites, and I was so pleased to see such a great turnout from the community. Thanks very much to the host, John Kerr, and to performers Jack Watson, Craig Martin, Sharon Rowntree and Sabrina Durante as well as to local school choirs from Coomera Anglican College and St Francis Xavier. Special mention goes to the Lions Club of Runaway Bay and to Danielle Goullet of Australian Events and Entertainment for her 13 years at the helm of this event. What a great way to start the festive season.</span>

The festival was held on the grounds of Amity College, a wonderful and inclusive school in the electorate of Werriwa, catering for students from preschool to year 12. The day was a platform to engage with the arts, food exhibitions and workshops like calligraphy and marbling to engage and showcase the talents and traditions of the diverse communities in our electorate. It's very important that initiatives like this are held to allow collaboration, dialogue and the exchange of ideas. These types of community events are important to keep Australia, and our community in Werriwa, the thriving and inclusive place that it is. Days and interactions like this show the community that, as human beings, we share all the same values: love, family and peace—particularly relevant given the world at present.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to personally congratulate the organising team—Mehmet Saral, Ismail and Recep Aydogan and Executive Principal of Amity College, Mehmet Koca—for the outstanding work that they did. The success of the festival was in no small part due to the hard work and dedication of the organising team. I am sure that next year the festival will go from strength to strength under their tireless leadership, and planning has already begun for next year's event.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last week, I was able to attend the 20th anniversary of the Country Education Foundation's Namoi branch, based at Narrabri. For 20 years they've been providing support, generously donated by local businesses and individuals. Over that time, over 400 country students from that area have been given assistance for their tertiary education. It's a great milestone to be celebrated, and supporting country kids into education is really important.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, I got a chance to attend the official opening of the Lachlan shire tourism precinct. It included: Utes in the Paddock—an array of utes individually decorated around the edge of the site; a wonderful new tourist information centre; and the Australian jockeys memorial, with over 800 names of all the jockeys that have ever passed away in the pursuit of their sport on that memorial.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on Saturday night out at Broken Hill at the business awards, 340 people turned up to celebrate the strength of the business community in Broken Hill. From hairdressers to engineers and from apprentices to CEOs, they were all recognised. It was a great night. Broken Hill is a town with a huge future and has a lot going for it. It was a privilege to be part of it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Recently, I held a forum with the Minister for Small Business, Julie Collins, at WOTSO, a company providing flexible office space. Of their 20 locations Australia-wide, WOTSO said their North Strathfield site was one of their most active, and I think that's testament to the entrepreneurial spirit in my electorate of Reid. Some of the local chambers of commerce came to the forum: Five Dock, Drummoyne and Majors Bay. They all play a pivotal role in supporting the community by supporting local charities and schools and running wonderful events and festivals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of the thousands of businesses in my electorate has a story of hard work and determination. Pron Prohm Thai on Concord Road is just one example. Opened by Dilok Thamrak more than three decades ago, it's one of Sydney's oldest Thai restaurants. Now his son Dereck runs this great local institution. Small businesses are often described as the engine room of the economy, but I think they are more than that. I think they are the lifeblood of our community. I've seen that with Philip and Adrian from Appetite Cafe, who help to make our community more inclusive. They have a pay-it-forward coffee system and provide low-cost catering for community organisations. Andrew Pelizzari runs Motiv8sports, a school holiday program, and has partnered with a local disability organisation to also get them involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I rise to congratulate the people of Narrogin in the Wheatbelt region of O'Connor for restoring their historic railway station. The story of Narrogin's early growth is very much the story of the station. In 1881, faster transport was required from Perth to Albany because the coach journey back then took five days. The solution would be a railway through Narrogin, which was then little more than a few dirt tracks and a wayside inn. The line opened in 1889, cutting the trip to seven hours. Narrogin became the line's maintenance and administration centre, and by 1921 the town had 20 commercial buildings including a flour mill, ice works and butter, bacon and cordial factories—even a doll factory. But, after the passenger service was discontinued in 1961, the station fell into disrepair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, Narrogin shire committed $400,000 of its allocation under the coalition government's Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program towards restoring the station, and the people of Narrogin got to work. At the station's reopening last month, shire president Leigh Ballard announced that the steam locomotive PM706, known as the Narrogin train, would return from the Hotham Valley Railway, which had cared for it for more than 30 years. The refurbished station now houses a visitor centre and an artist in residence, and only Narrogin businesses were used for the project. That's the way it should be for this local heritage hub that will continue to be a core part of the Narrogin story.</span>

Violence against women can happen in so many different settings—from the workplace to online spaces and at home or in public. With nearly one in three women around the world being subjected to this horror, I commend the work of the family, domestic and sexual violence sector. They deliver vital services to our local communities that suffer from this menace.</span>

To Kelda and her team, thank you for what you do for the women and children in our electorate and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud that our Albanese government is committed to addressing this issue through its national plan to end violence against women and children in one generation. Ending violence against women and children is everybody's responsibility and everybody's business. Together we can work to create a world where all women and children can be safe, loved and respected.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I rise to clarify my position regarding fuel excise supplied by the federal government. An article was recently published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Naracoorte Herald</span> on 25 October 2023 titled 'Calls to remove fuel tax'. The article claims that I called for the complete removal of the fuel excise. I wish to clarify that I have never suggested that the fuel excise should be abolished. The fuel excise was introduced in 1901 as a tax on motorists to fund road construction and maintenance. It remains an important and direct way to raise revenue to help pay for land transport infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, I want to see more of the excise raised invested for the very purpose for which it is raised. The Albanese government is choosing not to temporarily reduce the fuel excise for motorists during a cost-of-living crisis. That's their choice but a choice that those opposite have made. However, regardless of the rate of the excise, this revenue collected by the federal government via fuel excise should be invested completely into land transport infrastructure. It's disappointing to learn that only 68 per cent of the tax raised is being used for this purpose by this government. It's out of line with motorists' expectations, particularly when our roads are falling into disrepair. The fuel excise is an important revenue stream, and, while temporary relief during economic downturns is a useful leaver available to government, I have never called for the excise to be scrapped or abolished completely.</span>

Fair Canberra helps over 4,000 members from over 180 nationalities in our community every year.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Multicultural policy, introduced in Australia by the Labor government 50 years ago, coincided with the removal of the last vestiges of the White Australia policy—the Immigration Restriction Act. It heralded a new era in Australia. Australia's diversity is a fundamental aspect of our identity and a source of national strength and pride. Over half of us today either were born overseas or have a parent born overseas. We've come a long way in 50 years, but, by its nature, multiculturalism needs to be adaptable to remain a relevant concept to current populations, where we have multiethnic and multifaith households. The work of Fair Canberra, our migrant and refugee services and organisations like the Hellenic Club are making sure that this is the case and remains relevant today.</span>

With the ever-present need for more GPs, paediatricians and specialists, the level of access to care in the regions is not improving. In fact, in many areas, it's actively getting worse. We need to listen to our professionals on the ground, those working in our medical centres, in hospitals and in aged care, and to those who are educating the young people that our community desperately needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Turkiye, I am proud to say that I have been able to deepen my own understanding of the relationship Australia has with Turkiye. As we celebrate this landmark year with our friends from Turkiye, we look to continually building our already strong relationship, a relationship that is built on a shared history and genuine conversations, a relationship built on the aspiration for our families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many would know, the friendship between Turkiye and Australia began in the decades following the Gallipoli campaign. Gallipoli, of course, was the foundation for Australia's military legacy and, indeed, the foundation for the future Republic of Turkiye. As many will say, this friendship can be attributed to one man, the commander of the Turkish forces in Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who would later become the first president of the Republic of Turkiye. A fierce builder and advocate for his nation during his 15-year rule, many sweeping changes were introduced: political, legal and socioeconomic. Kemal was an extraordinary leader and peacemaker. In 1993, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I look to the world with an open heart full of pure feelings and friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1934, he extended an olive branch to our nation, uttering the famous words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives ... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours ... You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These words are a mark of respect, a mutual respect built between two nations. The respect extends to more than just words.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, I was lucky enough to be involved in the Australian Turkish Friendship Memorial, The Seeds of Friendship, a sculpture representing a pine cone from Turkiye and casuarina from Australia, representing the seeds of friendship sown for our future. We also show our respect to our fellow Turkish brothers and sisters. As a mark of respect, the only country that has been allowed to have a returned services league branch in the RSL in Australia has been Turkiye. This has been through the work of the subbranch president, Ramazan Alintas, a great man and a great friend.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the sunburnt country to the land of four seasons, we offer our friendship and our sincerest congratulations on the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkiye. We also celebrate this occasion with the Australian Turkish community that has made their home in our beautiful country. We recognise the ongoing contribution they have made to our nation, from the first flight in 1968 made up of 168 Turkish migrants to supply our workforce to the vibrant and growing community we know today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing up in Broadmeadows, in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, I was surrounded by a large and welcoming Turkish community. I was welcome in their homes. I learnt certain parts of the language—some I can't repeat—and had the luxury of growing up and enjoying their food and sport. The Australian Turkish community became my friends, teammates, classmates and neighbours, and these are friendships that have stood the test of time and shaped me into the person I am today, when it comes to my friendship with my Turkish community. I grew up seeing the ongoing commitment the Australian Turkish community made to our multicultural society. Turkish migrants often worked for 10 hours a day before completing English at nighttime at school. They did that to provide better opportunities for their families and to connect to the Australian community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our Australian Turkish community, I extend my sincere congratulations and best wishes on this momentous achievement. The relationship between Turkiye and Australia is now on strong foundations, with continued partnerships that have made both countries more prosperous and more secure. One part of the relationship I want to highlight is the incredibly important way in which we support each other during times of devastation. We saw the support provided by Turkiye during the Black Summer of 2019-2020, and Australia committed $11.5 million to Turkiye after the earthquake. Our two countries have built a relationship that will be able to endure the test of time. They are our friends, which is why I rise today to proudly celebrate and acknowledge the centenary of the Republic of Turkiye. Tebrik ederim—congratulations, and thank you very much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I second the motion and commend the member for McEwen for bringing the motion to the chamber. Congratulations to the Republic of Turkiye on the centenary of being a republic. I know that it will be celebrated at the mosques and the schools that are within cooee of my electorate. I know it's very difficult for some to celebrate at the moment, given the backdrop of the tragedies occurring in the Middle East, and I'm sure that the citizens of Turkiye feel this tragedy very deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Republic of Turkiye was founded on 29 October 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, a general-turned-politician who rescued his country from the clutches of European rule after the First World War and restructured the remainder of what was once a transcontinental and multicultural Islamic empire into a lean, new Anatolian republic, intending it to resemble Europe more closely. Turkiye's history is intimately tied to Ataturk, who was described as a secular nationalist leader who prioritised development reforms and separated religion from public life. Ataturk implemented political, social and cultural reforms that changed his country forever, creating new social and political cleavages as Turkish citizens began contesting the meanings of their country's history, their symbols and their identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his 15-year reign as president, Mustafa Ataturk abolished the sultanate. This drove the Ottoman royal family into exile, marking the end of a dynasty that had ruled Anatolia, the Balkans and large parts of the Middle East and North Africa for hundreds of years—quite an achievement. He also replaced the Arabic script with the Latin alphabet and enshrined women's right to vote. Ataturk died on 10 November 1938, leaving a towering legacy as a commander who rescued Anatolia from European occupation after the First World War and fanned a new nation out of the embers of the Ottoman Empire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even today, Ataturk is deeply venerated throughout Turkiye. His poster is seen on the walls of schools, offices and homes. I don't think there are a lot of photos of Australian politicians from between the wars on the walls of too many Australian schools. I'm told that every year, on the anniversary of Ataturk's death, in many places traffic comes to a halt as thousands observe a minute of silence. In the eighties and nineties, when those of my generation started to travel the world, they all thought that they'd discovered Turkiye for the first time. It was cheap to travel to. There were beautiful beaches. It wasn't commercialised and it had a taste of the exotic. The people were incredibly friendly, and there was a very strong association with Australia, obviously via Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pilgrimages to Gallipoli have taken place since the 1920s. However, it was in the 1980s that an increased number of Australian travellers began to gather at Anzac Cove in Turkiye for the official Anzac Day ceremony. Backpackers in their hundreds would camp overnight and wait for the dawn service. This became a rite of passage for many young Australians travelling through Europe—and still is. What drove many of those young Australian travellers was their own personal family stories that connected them to Turkiye, and my generation is possibly the last generation that had a physical connection, through our great-grandfathers or great-uncles, to those that had fought on the beaches and in trenches of Gallipoli. There were real childhood stories of Gallipoli, fanned by Peter Weir's great Australian film <span style="font-style:italic;">Gallipoli</span> or Alan Seymour's moving play <span style="font-style:italic;">The One Day of the Year</span>.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>It was a source of pride to have one's own connection to this beautiful country and its generous people who share a very poignant moment of Australian history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gallipoli remains an important place in the collective memory of many Australians, including within my own family. My wife's great-uncle, Private George Sedgeley Hodges of the 7th Company, Australian Machine Gun Corps, survived Gallipoli but then, like so many, died on the Western Front in 1917. My wife and I made a pilgrimage to the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium to acknowledge his remains, which, as was the case for so many Australians, were never found. Today over 33,000 Australians visit Turkiye each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to express a sincere thankyou to the government and people of Turkiye for their ongoing support for those Anzac commemorations at Gallipoli, where I dare say not every Australian is perfectly well behaved. The commemorations proceeded this year despite the impact of February's earthquakes. We should also recognise that Turkiye is currently hosting almost four million refugees fleeing the conflict on its southern borders. Four million refugees—imagine what the Coalition would do if four million refugees turned up in boats! We should also recognise that Australian and Turkiye worked closely together in Afghanistan on the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission to help build security capacity in the country. Australia opened up our Working Holiday Maker visa program to Turkiye some years ago so young people from Turkiye can come live and work in Australia for a period of time and make a contribution, making our relationship even stronger for the next generation. Happy centenary anniversary to the people of Turkiye!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on youth crime in Queensland far too many times this year. I continue to do so because, unfortunately, this is a scourge that continues to plague our state. You will hear other speakers from across the state follow me today. This is not an issue that's isolated to one area; it is spread right across Queensland. The reason I raise it is that there are things we can do about it here in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not for a second suggesting that the youth crime crisis we're experiencing is not entirely a result of the failure of the Palaszczuk Queensland government. Their repeated effort to go soft on crime in our state every chance they get has hurt Queenslanders. It has hurt people in the seats of Groom and Herbert and right across the state. In January, in Toowoomba, we saw the murder of Robert Brown by a young offender on the streets, and it caused a great outcry in our city. The horrific situation was caught on camera, showing the criminals taking his backpack from his lifeless body after they'd pushed him down onto the street. Weeks later, just metres from my front door, there was a violent assault with a sawn-off rifle, and that was followed by a stabbing on the other side of the block—right in broad daylight—in the centre of our city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals got together and put together what they thought was a sensible solution that I could take to this parliament. I raised it in a private member's bill, the Online Safety Amendment (Breaking Online Notoriety) Bill 2023, and I'm very happy I was supported by the member for Herbert at that time, but this is a solution that has come from locals. They have identified that we in the federal parliament have carriage of the internet—this is something that we can do. I want to thank Joe Noble and Helen Bell for their excellent efforts in raising this with me. What they brought to me was very simple: we could extend the remit of the e-Safety Commissioner to explicitly include criminal activity material in the posts that they, with the big tech companies, are able to take down. Without conflating the issues, I raise this in a year when we were lectured by the government on how important it is to listen to regional voices. This could not be a clearer request from regional voices to be listened to. This is a situation that is affecting families—mums and dads. People are living in fear, and there is something that we can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has had great support, be it from youth advocates or from the police force itself, right across the state. It's been effectively endorsed by the Queensland government—of all people—in bringing about additional police to deal with this. They understand that they have created a problem. They understand that they've built a monster. They understand that without action this will continue to grow. Sadly, they're not taking the action needed, and I'm sure you're going to hear more on that later. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what saddens me is that I brought this private member's bill to this place, and, when it was put before the minister for comment, her response was: 'Nothing to see here. Just raise it with the social media companies. If you've got a problem, raise it with the big tech companies, and they'll take it down.' And they will tell you the great stats of the hundreds of thousands of posts that they have taken down. But I can give you countless examples, just from the Toowoomba region, of posts that are promoting criminal activity on these platforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this important? Why do we need to raise this? It is because these posts are effectively a recruitment tool for the next generation of young kids. That has been found time and time again. This is how young kids are dragged into a life of crime. These posts are not simply depicting the crimes. They have soundtracks. They have great graphics. They are designed explicitly to go right up the algorithm so that people see them as often and as regularly as they can. They present an attractive view of the world of crime, and they are dragging these young kids into it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to see more young kids in detention—no-one does. I want to see fewer young kids committing these horrific crimes. What sorts of crimes am I talking about? I've raised a few. There are plenty, unfortunately, to talk about, because Queensland is on track to have its highest level of crime since 2001. In Toowoomba, there's a terrible case that speaks exactly to this issue. Young criminals tried to kill a man with a tomahawk, having stolen a car in a carjacking, and were then chased through town by police in a very dangerous situation. This was reported only this month. It is one of many cases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the minister to take action here. This is a simple step: simply include criminal activity material within the scope of the eSafety Commissioner. Allow them to take this down. Stop the cycle, stop the recruitment of more young kids into this, and do something about the youth crime crisis in Queensland. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  I rise to speak in response to the motion put forward by the member for Groom. I start by acknowledging upfront how horrific life can be for victims of crime and how, as governments—local, state and federal—we should be doing more to prevent any such crime. Sadly, like night follows day, you will always see the Liberal and National parties ringing the youth crime bell: youth crime, young offenders. I've heard this bleeding jeremiad regularly in Queensland. We know that there's a state election coming up in October next year, so obviously LNP politicians at the local, state and federal levels are rolling out the law-and-order issues. They did it in 2017, they did it in 2020, and here we are again in the prep for the 2024 election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember how tough on crime Campbell Newman was. That was his battle cry. Those opposite might remember him—the son of two Liberal ministers, who then ratted on the Liberal Party. When he was Premier, what did the Newman government do to actually show that he was tough on crime? The LNP cut about 110 senior officers from the Queensland police force and around 300 police admin staff, so frontline officers then had to perform those functions. They cut police training, reduced firearms training and forced police to pay for their own body-worn cameras. They cut $10 million from the youth justice budget and cut funds for youth support services. That was the LNP government. The LNP never let the facts get in the way of their devotion to scaremongering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, the number of 10- to 16-year-old offenders has actually decreased by 35 per cent in the past 10 years. The truth is that about 20 per cent of young offenders commit 55 per cent of the youth crime, so one in five kids are doing half the crime. The Queensland government introduced legislation this year that targets the small number of serious repeat offenders, and the government is investing in more police resources and intervention programs that can break the cycle of offending. We know—sensible people know—that there's no quick fix when it comes to youth justice issues. These are complex issues that are often the consequence of generations of family disfunction, drugs, abuse, poverty, disadvantage. Sensible government invest in the interventions that change the lives of young people, rather than attempt to punish kids forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, for example, that digital material featuring youth crime is causing harm in our communities and shows a flagrant and flippant disregard for the law, the policing agencies and the community. The Albanese government recognises there is an intersection of crime and the misuse and amplification of social media platforms as an emerging issue, not just in Queensland but across Australia—and the world, in fact. This material is usually posted online because those posting want to gain some notoriety; they want to be noticed, and in some cases they want to see how far they can go, often encouraging others to do the same, almost coercing their peers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to address these issues, it's important to reflect on the role of the eSafety Commissioner in disrupting and shutting down social media accounts that breach the Online Safety Act for the protection of our communities. The internet has economic, social and educational benefits, but Australians must feel safe when engaging with others online. The Online Safety Act was introduced in response to advances in technology and threats faced online from harmful behaviour and toxic content. We've all heard of kids that take their harm into their bedroom. There was an impetus for change: modern times of rapid change and social upheaval called for robust new laws. The objects of the Online Safety Act are to improve online safety for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the act empowers the eSafety Commissioner under the Online Content Scheme to require the removal of material that would be refused classification in Australia, including material promoting, inciting or instructing crime or violence. Online service providers must also adhere to a set of basic online safety and mandatory industry codes. The eSafety Commissioner works directly with law enforcement and online platforms to remove offending content. The eSafety Commissioner has advised that online platforms are more responsive to law enforcement requests that content be removed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last budget, esafety was provided with increased funding and will receive an additional $132.1 million over four years and see its base increase from $10.3 million to $42.5 million each year. The minister is also bringing forward the independent statutory review of the Online Safety Act. This will make sure that the online safety framework remains fit for the changing online environment and can deal appropriately with online harms.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I'd like to thank my friend the member for Groom for bringing this motion forward. The electorate of Herbert, Townsville, is nationally renowned for crime and for violent criminal acts that we are seeing constantly, every night, from youth criminals. Tonight, like last night, like tomorrow night, people's houses will be broken into and their property will be stolen. Youth criminals will terrorise the streets, and people will feel like prisoners in their own home. This is simply not good enough. But this is a failure that we have seen from the state Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak on the eSafety Commissioner, I think it is important to highlight what I would like to see happen to these youth criminals. We saw the state Labor government talk about mandatory maximum sentencing. We need to flip that on its head and make it mandatory minimum sentencing. We need to remove detention as a last resort out of the Youth Justice Act and have early intervention at prenatal, not at 13, not at 15, not at 17. We need to target the right age to give these young people the best hope. But also we have to punish bad behaviour. I think the message needs to be very clear: if you commit crime, then you should do time. There is no place for this behaviour in our country, and people should feel safe in their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that's not what's happening in Townsville. Youth criminals are taking to their social media pages. They are filming themselves as they steal someone's car, as they rob someone in the street or as they break into a home with a machete. They post it online, they get all the notoriety they're chasing and they perpetuate further criminal activity to even where they use it as a game. Some time ago, we had a helicopter over the top and planes being diverted because a stolen car was running riot around Townsville, and these youth criminals were filming it. Another time these youth criminals were ramming police cars, ramming ambulances, ramming people on the street and filming it. And they would post things like, 'You don't stop us; we come after you.' This needs to be stopped. We have the ability. I think this has gone on for far too long. Townsville gets compared to places in other nations with their criminal activity. Youth crime has never been targeted by the Queensland state Labor government. The previous member can say that we roll this out every couple of years, but I've been talking about it since I was elected because it is the No. 1 issue in Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dozens of cars get stolen every day, and it's a grim reality for many constituents, like John, a father of two, who had his house broken into and Jeep stolen in the dead of night. Videos of reckless teenagers doing burnouts in multilane traffic were plastered all across social media. John was receiving updates every minute from family and friends who were forwarding him the videos. Can you imagine the emotions of someone who has worked so hard and had a criminal come into his house when his kids are inside, steal his car and then post about it all over social media? Helpless to stop the action, anger towards the criminals, fear for community safety and the concern for the wellbeing of others watching the video—the list goes on. But what happens to these youth criminals? Do they get locked up? Very rarely, if at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that this online activity is affecting the community. How does it affect young people who are vulnerable? Watching these criminals stealing cars, posting about it and not getting in trouble—the revolving door spinning. Why do early intervention when they're not in trouble for bad behaviour? If you have two kids and one child bites the other one, you don't give that one a lollipop. But essentially that's what's happening in Queensland, and that's what's making this revolving door continue to spin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do our bit to break the intergenerational cycle of crime, and the way to do that is to be tough on law and order and tough on people that break these rules and break the laws and to stop it at the next generation. And the eSafety Commissioner has that ability. But a year ago this was raised, and still nothing has been done. Labor need to get off their hands and do something.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Groom for bringing forward this important motion. Not a week goes by when I do not receive correspondence from distressed constituents witnessing break-ins or youths clambering up drainpipes, waking them up at three in the morning or kicking in their doors while children are at home. These accounts are terrifying, and they're coming from the leafy suburbs in my electorate, hardly known as hotbeds of violence. On a street walk one day, I met a couple painting their parapet wall in anticipation of gates being installed due to local crime. On another walk, I encountered an entire street who are on a WhatsApp group due to local crime related to young people loitering in a school up the street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Knife crime takes risk to stratospheric levels. Earlier this year, a couple of teenage boys in my electorate were set upon by a group of youths in an unprovoked attack. One boy incurred life-threatening injuries requiring major thoracic surgery. The mental scars take much longer to heal. Knife crime has surged since 2019, resulting in an increase in hospitalisations, which suggests an increase in the severity of these injuries. A trauma surgeon and former colleague at the Alfred actually described this as some type of madness. My local police commander said it is becoming normalised for kids to walk out of the house and grab their keys, their phone and their knife. I thank my local police in Stonnington, Boroondara and Malvern for their assistance. As frontline responders, they put themselves in harm's way for our safety. It is risky work, which they discharge with professionalism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that the online world is amplifying the notoriety of young offenders. Social media is the accelerant of all society's ills. The algorithms are skewed to shock, captivate and polarise, not to soothe, educate or unite. So what levers does the Commonwealth have? The Online Safety Act already provides the eSafety Commissioner with powers to require the removal of material that would be refused classification in Australia, including material promoting, inciting or instructing crime or violence. The eSafety Commissioner works directly with law enforcement and online platforms to remove offending content. The minister is bringing forward the independent statutory review of the Online Safety Act, with public consultation to commence in early 2024. In the 2023-24 budget, the eSafety platform was provided with an additional $132 million over four years, with an increase in base funding from $10 million to $42.5 million each year. In other words, it was starved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2022 October budget confirmed the government's election commitment of $6 million over three years to roll out the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation's eSmart Digital Licence+ and Media Literacy Lab in all Australian schools. It starts with education amongst our children in schools. Regulation, however, does not fix an unloved upbringing, a violent parent, the discomfort of sleeping in a car, the shame of illiteracy, the barriers arising from undiagnosed mental illness or birth trauma. It does not erase the revolving door of out-of-home care. Young people do not grow up aspiring to take the pathway to jail. Somewhere, they have missed the foothold on the ladder of opportunity. Perhaps there were too many setbacks in their formative years, with their downward spiral now threatening to take innocent people in quiet communities like mine down with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't, however, arrest our way out of youth crime. It demands a multiplicity of measures, starting from the early years: secure housing, access to health care—starting with a bulk-billed GP, supported by tripling of our bulk-billing incentive—and an educational safety net provided by astute educators, who we are trying to attract and retain with scholarships and fee waivers. It requires listening to young people like those in our youth advisory councils and removing cost barriers to skills for our oversubscribed TAFE courses, supported by foundational skill training for those who missed out on reading and writing in school. Evidence shows that, when children and young people are healthy and given opportunities to flourish, be inspired and learn, they are far less likely to offend. Replacing a punitive mindset with a therapeutic one is not easy, but it is necessary.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300120" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I rise today in support of this excellent motion moved by my good friend the member for Groom. There's no doubt that youth crime is at crisis level across Queensland after almost nine years of the state Labor government. Community anger and frustration over this issue is widespread, and this anger is supported by lived experience and statistical evidence. We are seeing groups of concerned citizens rise up across our community, including Voice for Victims, which has held several mass protests in Brisbane and has pushed demands for a stronger law and order response and higher assistance payments to victims. Recent analysis by the Australian Institute of Criminology has revealed that the top five worst cities in Australia, according to crime statistics, are all in Queensland: Logan City, Mount Isa, Rockhampton, Townsville—the member for Herbert was discussing the issues facing his community—and Cairns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is also not immune from this crisis. Local police sources tell me that a vast majority of criminal activity within the Redlands is conducted by a dozen or so youth offenders that they know well. We've seen home invasions, robberies and, worst of all, the death of Katherine Leadbetter—who was 24 weeks pregnant—and her husband Matthew Field, who were walking their dogs in Alexandra Hills on Australia Day 2021 when they were struck by a car driven by a teenager on a drug fuelled rampage. Sadly, we've seen inaction from the state Labor government. In fact, Labor state member for Capalaba, Don Brown, recently said that the youth crime crisis was 'a media beat-up', much to the outrage of the local victims of this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crimes are bad enough, but the problem is made worse by these youth offenders bragging about their exploits on social media platforms and inspiring others to try to outdo each other in the brazenness and the impact of their crimes. These digital trophies need to be targeted by law enforcement to prevent the proliferation of crime across our communities. The Queensland government continues to turn a blind eye to the uses of social media platforms which glorify violent crime and challenge community standards to such an extent. It is easy to say that this is a state government program, but the federal government does have the power to impact on this crisis by utilising the powers of the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition proudly created and funded the Office of the eSafety Commissioner in 2015. The eSafety Commission was a world first; no other country had a comparable program at the time, and many still don't. In 2021, the coalition government passed the Online Safety Act, giving the eSafety Commissioner strong new powers, including a world-first scheme to take down adult cyberabuse. Under the coalition, the total budget of the eSafety Commissioner grew consistently to more than $53 million in 2021-22, with a mixture of base and dedicated program funding. This motion calls on the government to protect victims of crime by empowering the eSafety Commissioner to explicitly handle online content of criminal activity material in a similar way to how it already utilises its powers to deal with cyberbullying and cyberabuse material under the current arrangements. I understand that there's currently a ministerial review of the Online Safety Act, and this issue certainly should be included as part of that review, and we strongly encourage the government to consider that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very much a commonsense approach to dealing with this problem. Of course it's not a silver bullet. This isn't the only way that we're going to be able to tackle the youth crime crisis, which I know is impacting so many communities not just in Queensland but across Australia. But it is a step to provide some additional resources to tackle the social scourge that is now totally out of hand. It's totally out of hand within the Redlands, which I represent, and across all the communities in Queensland, it seems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also commend the member for Groom's private members' bill introduced earlier this year, which if adopted by the government would give effect to the policy intent of this motion. I commend him as well for bringing this motion forward so we can keep the pressure up and keep the debate going on this important reform. Queenslanders are sick of the impact of youth crime on our communities. We are sick of governments burying their heads in the sand while our streets are taken over. We are sick of the fear that these criminals have created within our communities. This is a practical way to impact on that problem, and I commend the motion to the House. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  If the member for Groom did his homework, he'd know certain things like facts and statistics. Queensland crime statistics clearly show that youth crime has actually decreased by 35 per cent in the past 10 years and by 30 per cent over the past five years, and the rate of individual youth offenders in 2021-22 was the lowest on record and has declined over the last 10 years, since 2012-13, when the LNP were in power in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true there's a cohort of serious repeat offenders responsible for a disproportionate number of offences, and they should be prosecuted with the full force of the law. Some of these offenders have shown a blatant disregard for the law by using social media to glorify their nefarious activities online and attract other people, young people in particular, into criminal behaviour. But it's this cohort that the Queensland government's tough youth justice laws, like the new breach of bail offences, are targeting, as well as tackling the complex causes of youth crime and investing in community safety. Since these laws came into effect in March in Queensland, 93 child defendants have been charged with publishing details of offending on social media, with a conviction rate of 100 per cent for matters finalised by the courts. On top of this, the Palaszczuk Labor government's investing more into police resources and intervention programs to break the cycle of offending, with an additional investment of more than $446 million, which is building on the $800 million already invested in youth justice and diverting young people away from crime. This is backed up by $69 million in federal government funding for the National Justice Reinvestment Program, which empowers communities to identify and implement local solutions when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see the motion makes a token attempt to link this issue to the federal government by calling on the Albanese government to 'enhance protections of children and young people online, from digital content that depicts criminal activity'. And it calls on the government to protect victims of crime by empowering the eSafety Commissioner to handle online content depicting criminal activity. While I appreciate the sentiment, the reality is that the Online Safety Act already provides the eSafety Commissioner with powers under the Online Content Scheme to remove material which would be refused classification in Australia, including material promoting, inciting or instructing crime or violence. The eSafety Commissioner already works directly with law enforcement agencies and online platforms to remove the offending content. The government's actually conducting a review of the Online Safety Act, with public consultation to be commenced early next year, so the member for Groom is welcome to make a submission for the review, which frankly would be far more constructive than grandstanding and moving motions like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this exercise just makes the member for Groom look like he's in the wrong parliament. He should have run for Toowoomba South or Toowoomba North and served in George Street in Brisbane. I know that's what LNP members from Queensland think they're doing; they think they're in the wrong parliament! The member for Groom should stick to his job as a federal MP rather than trying to help his Queensland LNP mates with scare campaigns on youth crime. They talk a big game when it comes to law and order but they don't listen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the cuts and chaos under Campbell Newman. Under Campbell Newman, 110 senior officers were cut and 300 police personnel were cut under the last coalition government. They reneged on their promise to provide $20 million for extra police and police training and safe-night-out precincts. They wasted $16.7 million on a failed boot camp experiment to breed faster and fitter criminals. They cut the police monitoring of more than 1,700 sex offenders, and who could forget the spectacular failure of their outlaw bikie laws? Even in opposition in Queensland, the LNP have failed to deliver a comprehensive crime plan. It's now more than a thousand days since they promised one, and, based on their 2020 state election commitment, there'd a thousand fewer police on the beat if they had won the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the member for Groom: how about you seek preselection in Toowoomba North or Toowoomba South? Do your job as a federal MP and make that submission to that online safety inquiry, rather than bring motions like this. We have serious criminal problems across the country and we need to deal with them seriously, rather than waste the federal government and this parliament's time by grandstanding and helping your LNP mates in Queensland. Go and seek preselection into Toowoomba South or Toowoomba North. When it comes to federal parliament, don't lecture us on, basically, state issues around youth crime and community safety. Work with us and work with the Queensland government and have your Queensland LNP opposition mates do their job and develop some policies across that area. Get your facts right. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I thank the member for Groom for moving this incredibly important motion and highlighting the deplorable and unsettling rise in violent youth crime across Queensland, especially in my electorate of Dawson. It is ripping our spirits to threads, making our people live in fear and lock themselves inside or even leave our beautiful region. Frankly, what is beginning to happen to the people in my electorate and the inaction of our current federal and state governments is absolutely disgraceful. For our people to prosper and be able to live their lives to the fullest and enjoy what only North Queensland has to offer, they first have to have the most basic human need of personal safety met, and that just isn't happening.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know that, when we're sitting in our lounge rooms watching TV or leaving the house to go to work, we are safe; that the belongings that we have worked so hard to pay for are safe; that we won't be robbed in broad daylight at knifepoint; that, when we're taking our children for a bike ride to the park, we're not going to get ambushed by 10 young kids brandishing weapons, like what happened in Idalia in my electorate; that a 74-year-old neighbour won't be assaulted in his own home so that a couple of teenagers can go for a joyride until the fuel runs out, like what happened in Annandale in my electorate a few weeks ago; and that our partners, husbands, wives or children won't have to sleep with weapons next to their beds if they go away because they're too fearful for their safety.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening in my electorate right now.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes it worse is we're seeing a dangerous competition emerging among these young offenders, fuelled by the desire for notoriety and misguided notions of popularity. This is no longer about a single moment of adrenaline; this has transformed into a contest, not of skills or achievements, but rather a race to commit the most appalling acts, leaving our people marred with the consequences of these thoughtless actions. If their mate steals a Mazda then they steal a BMW. If their mate steals a BMW then they have to steal a Mercedes. If their mate steals a Mercedes, they want to steal a Porsche. If their mate steals a Porsche, what next? Do they want to steal a life? All of this is being posted online for bragging rights, in a fight to be the biggest and the baddest, traumatising their victims over and over again. We need to protect our children and young people who might be drawn into a life of crime by these glorified videos that they are seeing online. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is vitally important, and the time to act is now. Today I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government to stop sitting on their hands and turning a blind eye to this issue. I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government to enhance protections for our children and young people online, against digital content that depicts criminal activity material, and prevent them from a life of crime. And I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government to protect victims of crime by empowering the eSafety Commissioner to explicitly handle online content of criminal activity material in a similar way to how cyberbullying and cyberabuse material is treated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Australia. And the fact is that it is 2023 and the people in my electorate are so afraid for their safety that they are sleeping with weapons beside the bed. This is truly unacceptable. The fact is that people in my electorate are thinking twice about taking the kids to the park because they can't guarantee they'll make it there and back safely. That's just appalling. Prime Minister, it's time to stamp out this criminal activity being posted online now. Protect these victims and, please, protect our children. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I want to thank the member for Groom for bringing this motion to the chamber today and giving us the opportunity to talk about the action that the Albanese Labor government is taking to ensure that Australian children are protected online. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Communications has instigated a review to the Online Safety Act to ensure that the act stays up to date with the rapidly changing nature of the online environment. E-safety is a government priority, with $132.1 million provided over four years. The $42.5 million in base funding will allow the eSafety Commissioner to keep pace with complaints, improve awareness in the community of their role, and fully implement industry codes and basic online safety expectations. The Albanese Labor government has been strongly in support of eSafety's role. Under the former Liberal government, eSafety's funding would have declined, falling to $10.3 million by 2027-28. Labor will instead continue to put cybersafety first and ensure eSafety is able to continue their crucial work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor made an election commitment to roll out the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation's eSmart Digital Licence+ and Media Literacy Lab to all Australian schools. This will allow children to develop key skills that will allow them to navigate the cyberworld throughout the rest of their lives. In 2024, the eSmart Digital Licence+ will become available in schools, to equip teachers to help children aged between 10 and 14 to develop critical cybersafety skills. This will be closely followed by the eSmart Junior Digital Licence+, which is aimed at helping students between five and nine, in the second half of the year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry codes are a key way forward in addressing serious, harmful content online. The first round of industry codes specifically addresses the most harmful online content—namely, child abuse material and pro-terror content. The second round of industry codes will be for lower-risk types of harmful content, including refused classification material and online pornography. The code development process started in late 2022, and, currently, six out of eight online industry sections have registered codes. All codes will commence six months after their registration in December of this year and March next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2022, the eSafety Commissioner issued the first ever non-periodic reporting notices requiring reports on steps being taken to tackle online sexual exploitation. Summaries of responses received were published, and the commissioner acknowledged that services are currently not doing enough to tackle online child abuse. The second round of notices required five or more social media providers to report on how they were tackling child sexual exploitation, sextortion and the use of algorithmic recommendation systems. The eSafety Commissioner has been taking stronger steps to address noncompliance, including providing a warning to Google and issuing a fine to Twitter for their failure to comply with eSafety's reporting notice. In June this year, eSafety issued a non-periodic reporting notice to Twitter requiring further information on the steps that Twitter owner, X Corp, is taking to implement and enforce its policies against online hate and abuse. The eSafety Commissioner is combatting noncompliance by international social media companies and driving change within the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is deeply committed to funding the work of the eSafety Commissioner and ensuring that it can continue for years to come. This Labor government is committed to ensuring that Australians are safe online. In January, the Minister for Communications and Minister for Social Services convened a national round table on online dating safety. The discussion included leading voices from federal, state and territory governments; law enforcement; academia; the family, sexual and domestic violence sector; diversity and inclusion organisations; as well as senior executives of the most popular dating apps on the market. In September this year, the Minister for Communications wrote to the seven most popular online dating companies in Australia, requesting that they develop a voluntary code of conduct to keep their users safe. Three major companies—Match Group, Bumble and RSVP—have already committed to collaborate on the code. Industry has nine months to develop the code, and its effectiveness will be assessed after nine months of operation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's very clear our government takes this very seriously. Could I say, particularly as a parent with children who don't yet, but probably soon will, access the online world, that this is really important and it's really comforting to know how seriously our government takes this, in spite of scaremongering from those opposite.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I rise to address a critical issue of both national and global importance: the safeguarding of our Great Barrier Reef. It's a remarkable natural wonder, spanning over 2,300 kilometres. This vast and diverse ecosystem, comprising over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, is not only a cherished part of our national heritage but also a global example and symbol of biodiversity. I commend UNESCO's recent decision to not classify the Great Barrier Reef as in danger. This reflects the effective environmental policies implemented by the Albanese government since the coalition circus was sent packing. These policies, crafted and executed under the leadership of our Minister for the Environment and Water, demonstrate our commitment to combating climate change, enhancing water quality and promoting sustainable fishing. These efforts have significantly strengthened the resilience and sustainability of the reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Barrier Reef is more than just a marine park and a tourist destination. It's an irreplaceable ecosystem, an indicator of our planet's health and a source of inspiration for scientists, nature enthusiasts and Indigenous peoples alike—and something that every Far North Queenslander is proud of. I say that as I'm married to one. And I note in passing the death of my magnificent sister-in-law Robyn Boulton last Thursday. I will be going back to Cairns on Friday for her funeral. Regrettably, the previous Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments neglected the reef's plight. They were terms in office marked by inaction and a lack of substantive measures. This neglect led to severe coral bleaching events, a consequence of global warming, while the scientific warnings about the reef's deteriorating health were largely ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's lack of effective action has had significant repercussions. The reef, a biodiversity hotspot, supports thousands of unique species and is integral to the livelihoods of over 64,000 Australians, contributing $6.4 billion annually to our economy, mainly through tourism. However the reef's value extends beyond economics, embodying deep cultural significance for the traditional owners who have stewarded these lands and seas for millennia. The Labor Party has consistently recognised the reef as both an ecological wonder and a bellwether for global environmental issues. Our commitment to its preservation is evident in our history of decisive action and forward-thinking policy. The establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority by the Whitlam government in the early 1970s marked a significant conservation milestone, especially in light of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's efforts at the time. Subsequent Labor governments have upheld this legacy, with the reef's designation as a World Heritage site in 1981 and the expansion of marine protected areas under the Rudd and Gillard administrations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our history is not just one of conservation; it's also one of adaptation and innovation. We've pioneered research and monitoring efforts to understand the impacts of climate change on the reef and have sought to address the root causes of its decline. It is the Labor Party that has continually placed the health of the reef at the forefront of our climate policies, understanding the inextricable link between the two. We've fought for strong action on climate change not only as a moral imperative but as a critical measure for the reef's survival. The current government's commitment to the reef and the challenge of climate change is evident in our actions. We've allocated a record $1.2 billion for comprehensive reef management and conservation, aiming to protect its unique marine life. We've set ambitious goals, including a 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2035 and achieving 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030. These initiatives underline our resolve to address climate change, which is the most significant long-term threat to the reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our efforts extend to improving water quality, with $150 million dedicated to critical projects, and phasing out gillnets in collaboration with the Queensland government, supported by a $160 million package. We've opposed harmful industrial and mining projects and enhanced the role of Indigenous rangers in managing sea country. We also withdrew funding from dam projects that would negatively impact on reef water quality. In May this year, we doubled funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science to bolster reef science, a testament to our evidence based approach. UNESCO's decision acknowledges the positive shift in Australia's environmental policies under Labor's governance. Obviously there's more work to be done. It's a call to intensify our efforts so that we protect the reef for our children and our children's children. It's a vital ecological asset and a great economic driver.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I second the motion. The international community, including UNESCO and the World Heritage Committee, has shone a spotlight on our country's management of the Great Barrier Reef for more than a decade. In 2022, UNESCO and the International Union for Conservation of Nature made 22 recommendations to our governments to help retain the reef's World Heritage status. Those recommendations include improving our climate policies and emissions targets, improving water quality, stopping tree clearing in reef catchments and restoring coastal wetlands. The Australian and Queensland governments must now make good on those recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus today on the three major threats facing the reef identified by that report. The first is the threat of rapidly heating waters caused by climate change. Climate change is the biggest threat to our reef. Since 2016, the reef has suffered from four mass bleaching events. Corals are very sensitive to temperature changes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that, if we allow global warming to reach two degrees, we will lose 99 per cent of our coral reefs. The government's current target of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 is in line with two degrees of warming, with loss of 99 per cent of the world's coral reefs. Therefore, the single most important action this government can take to protect the Great Barrier Reef is to increase its emissions reduction target to 75 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2035 and to halt all new fossil fuel projects—coal mining, fracking and offshore oil and gas exploration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second major threat to the reef comes from water pollution from poor land management practices. Run-off from agricultural land includes nitrogen from excess fertiliser and sediment from overgrazing and land and tree clearing. Pesticides, nitrogen and phosphorus gel contribute to algal blooms and, subsequently, to uncontrolled spread of the crown-of-thorns starfish, which is responsible for more than 40 per cent of the reef's 3.4 per cent per year of coral decline. Sediment can smother both coral and the seagrass beds that marine life, such as threatened dugongs, depend upon. Both starfish and the sediment contribute to poor water quality, and they are major threats to the reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Australia has set targets to reduce sediment and nitrogen running into the reef's waters, we are nowhere near meeting those targets. In September 2023, the World Heritage Committee again expressed serious concern regarding this delay. It has accepted the recommendation from UNESCO to give Australia until February 2024 to show progress on actions to protect the Great Barrier Reef, but we remain on notice. Government investment must be targeted towards those places that need it most. Now is the time for a major shift in the government's water quality programs, to focus on landscape restoration in the biggest pollution hot spots for the reef. Now is the time for a plan for how this government will tackle nitrogen from fertiliser use. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third major threat comes from unsustainable commercial fishing. This is a major threat to the reef and to endangered wildlife. The Australian and Queensland governments have committed $160 million to remove all commercial gillnet licences by 2027, with most being removed this year, to create new net-free zones in areas of critical habitat. They have also undertaken to legislate for and implement independent monitoring of high-risk fishing activities. These commitments will reduce the risks of commercial fishing to iconic threatened species on the reef. They must be delivered within the committed time frames.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country we must soon report back to UNESCO on our progress in better protecting the Great Barrier Reef. That wonderful reef faces the fight of its life, a fight set to get harder with climate change and the forthcoming El Nino event. We must protect this unique national treasure for the sake of the reef itself, for the sake of the $6.4 billion tourism industry and for the sake of the 64,000 jobs that it supports.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I rise to support this important motion and thank the member for Moreton, my fellow Queenslander from the class of 2007, for it and acknowledge his longstanding passion and commitment to the environment and action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September, the World Heritage Committee decided not to list the Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger'. This confirmed the draft decision from UNESCO handed down in August, which cited 'significant progress' being made on climate change, water quality and sustainable fishing, which will all put the reef on a stronger and more sustainable path.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very good outcome and particularly welcome news in regional communities in Queensland, where the Great Barrier Reef supports local jobs and local economies. It injects about $6.4 billion into state and regional economies every year through tourism and other income, and it's estimated to support about 64,000 jobs, most of which are in regional towns along the length of the eastern coast of Queensland, as well as cafes, restaurants, hotels and, of course, a flotilla of reef boats. There wouldn't be a Queenslander who hasn't enjoyed the Great Barrier Reef. I think it's a fantastic place to visit. So it's important not only for the environment but for the economy in my home state of Queensland. It's important for our national economy as well—64,000 jobs is a lot of jobs both in Queensland and nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It confirms that the Albanese Labor government, together with the Palaszczuk Labor government—in my home state of Queensland—is acting on climate change and working hard to protect the reef and that the rest of the world has taken notice. Of course, this decision that was made recently doesn't mean that the reef is in the clear; it won't deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. Every coral reef in the world will be vulnerable if we don't take action on climate change. But it just confirms that the Labor government's policy, at both levels, is making a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition really didn't care about the reef. They refused to take action on climate change, and, again, that changed with the change of government last year. A decision was made clear, and Australia's environmental policies were fundamentally changed under Labor and for better. In fact, around that time we understand sources close to UNESCO told the French newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Monde</span> that on climate change and the environment: 'the approach from the Australian government has completely changed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Between the new government and the old one, it's a bit like night and day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or, as President Macron might say: 'I don't think Australia has a better climate policy now. I know.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, the government has hit the ground running, tackling climate change and the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, investing a record $1.2 billion in the reef and delivering a raft of measures on climate change, water quality and sustainable fishing, which this motion sets out. In fact, just last week the Minister for the Environment and Water was in Cairns announcing an extra $50 million to improve water quality on the reef, bringing our total investment to $200 million. The UNESCO and World Heritage Committee decision makes clear Australia's environmental policies have fundamentally changed under this government and changed for the better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's appalling track record on climate change and the environment showed they really didn't care. The Liberal and National parties put the reef at risk for a decade and did so by their failure on climate change policy, and they continue to demonstrate disregard for it. There are so many people sitting on the opposition benches that don't believe humans have any impact on the environment, let alone any impact on climate change. Well, that's all changed under this government. We actually believe in the science. We don't believe in the mythology that those opposite believe in. Seriously, they should look at science and be governed by expert advice in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure you that farmers in my electorate believe strongly in climate change. They really do, because they see the impact on their properties and their grazing lands and their crops each and every day. The National Farmers Federation and other agricultural groups, tourism groups and the business community have been way ahead of those opposite when it comes to taking action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the difference between the European assessment of us as a government and the European assessment of the last government during two parliamentary delegations in the last two years. European hosts and government officials from countries like Belgium, the EU, France, Sweden and the UK all recognised that under this government Australia is once again serious about taking action on climate change. This government will support Australia's special places and the plants and animals that call it home. We'll always support the Australians who rely on a healthy environment for jobs and, what's more, our policies will make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, because of environmental, cultural and economic importance, the government, in consultation with science, industry, conservation and other experts, will take strong action to protect the reef. The motion talks about recognising the importance of our partners, agencies and stakeholders, and we'll continue to work with the business community and the Palaszczuk government to protect our reef, and that's very important. It's the planet's natural wonder.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  Australians and people from around the world love the Great Barrier Reef. Its natural beauty, its diverse marine wildlife and its protection of our northern east coastline are not to be taken for granted. But the inclusion of the phase out of gillnet fishing in this motion is falsely tying this ill-informed decision to the protection of the reef. We just heard from a member of parliament who lives in Ipswich, and before that we had the member for Moreton, who brought forward this bill. They don't live near the Great Barrier Reef, and it's clear they haven't done much fishing or spoken to any local fishers. You can't net the reef; you can't put a net over the top of the Great Barrier Reef. For one simple reason: it will cut the net to pieces. So, to say that you need to ban gillnet fishing to save the Great Barrier Reef is false, is misleading and makes clear that the government hasn't consulted anyone locally who works on the reef, any fishers that are out there, or anyone that supports this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June this year, the Minister for the Environment and Water made the decision to phase out N2 and N4 fishing licences by 31 December 2023. Since the announcement, I've been strongly advocating to press pause so that proper community consultation can take place. Imagine that—a government consulting the people it's going to affect. We were promised that at the last election, but, once again, it's another broken promise by this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to both the Minister for the Environment and Water and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and put forward several recommendations, including the immediate commencement of community consultation. How is this for playing the blame game? The Labor Minister for the Environment and Water passed the buck off to one of her bureaucrats, who then referred responsibility to the state Labor minister. He didn't bother to respond at all. He refuses to even talk to the community or the media about what's going on. Talk about pointing the finger and letting the community down. The lack of responsibility over what is supposedly a joint initiative is dumbfounding. How can you completely destroy an industry without so much as answering basic questions?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last sitting period, the coalition government moved a motion for a formal inquiry into the adoption of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee policy directives. This was, of course, blocked by the Albanese Labor government and their Greens mates. If you don't want to be questioned over a policy, that is a clear indicator of what sort of policy it is. It's one which they know they don't have any good answers for. So, instead of answering basic questions, what do those opposite do? They put forward this tricky motion that is nothing but a false promotion of their decision to phase out a low-impact fishing technique and destroy the Australian seafood industry. I'll ask again. Where do the fishers go? What do people like Dr Andrew Tobin do? He is the owner of a net license, retail shop and seafood truck. He delivers fish and wild-caught seafood across north-west Queensland. With this phase-out, he is set to lose it all. Out of everything that he's set to lose, what will he get compensation for? His licence, and his license only. Never mind the seafood truck, the retail shop or the impact on the sales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said it before, and I will say it again: this phase-out is cutting off the hand that feeds the industry, resulting in the loss of jobs and the closure of businesses that rely on this source of seafood product. Our fishing industry is already heavily regulated, with all commercial fishers keeping well-documented logbooks with up-to-the-minute information. All vessels are equipped with satellites for the purpose of monitoring their movement and communication. But both ministers don't understand their portfolios when they think fishing with a net on the reef is even possible, like I said at the start. This is the complete and utter nonsense coming out of this Labor federal government, as well as the Labor state government in Queensland. The sheer incompetence to think that a net can go over the reef just shows they have spent no time out there, and to see the blame game and the pointing of the fingers is disgraceful. I call on both state and federal ministers to get out there and speak with locals on the ground. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I rise today to speak on this motion. While I stand here amidst a chorus of self-congratulations by those opposite, I must lend a voice to reason and reality. The government has presented a litany of supposed achievements concerning the Great Barrier Reef, yet it seems that their memory is conveniently very, very selective, forgetting that many of these accomplishments did not magically materialise within the last election cycle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was under the guidance and stewardship of the previous government that we have record investment in the Great Barrier Reef. It was us who initiated the Reef 2050 Plan and established the role of the Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, a position I was very honoured to hold and to discharge dutifully. We catalysed partnership with tourism operators to gather data and undertake restoration efforts on the reef, an innovative approach that leveraged downtime and supported the industry during the unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the reef envoy, I released compelling six-monthly reports that advocated strongly for increased support in the reef within key agencies like GBRMPA and AIMS. Sadly, this is a practice that seems to have dramatically waned under the current government's Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, Senator Green, who's had only one single—and frankly lacklustre—report in her name since she was appointed into the role nearly 18 months ago. Government likes to tout its achievements with great flair, but we must ask: where is the continuation of critical work that we began—the work to combat the leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent flows from the coastal cities on the eastern seaboard, the ground work that was laid for essential steps to improve water quality? We're ready to go, but they've seemingly been dropped from this government's agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another credible hallmark of the previous government was the establishment of the Indigenous Rangers Program. It's been an incredibly successful program, and it has expanded widely. We provided funding for the first purpose-built vessel to the Yirrganydji rangers—another testament to our commitment to Indigenous led conservation. Despite the government's claims of enhancing their environmental efforts, what they really mean to say is that they are proactively decimating the local fishing industry. If they weren't so wet behind the years, they would know that this only serves to hurt local people, local businesses and, of course, the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has some of the best managed fisheries and some of the greatest protected places in the world, and the government's short-sighted attack on gillnet fishing will only open up a path for illegal and less sustainable options to flood the market. They would rather sideline a sustainable local fishing industry in favour of imports from economies which, at best, have very dubious environmental and sustainability practices. It's a decision that demonstrates a stark lack of understanding and an unwillingness to engage with industry stakeholders, like the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, as well as affected local generational fishers. It clearly illustrates that this government's preference is to choose perception over reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not allow this narrative to be distorted. The current government are attempting to build on foundations laid by their predecessors, on initiatives that we pioneered, yet they seem all too eager to claim these successes as their own. In truth, the trajectory of improvement in the stewardship of the Great Barrier Reef began well before their term, and any suggestion to the contrary is simply, to put it bluntly, an attempt to rewrite history. While I acknowledge the steps that have been taken, I cannot condone the grandstanding that suggests that these are new paths forged by the current government. The reef's guardianship is not a political game; it is a profound responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must continue this mission with honesty, humility and respect for those who have toiled before us. Governments of the present and future have an important responsibility to secure the future health of the Great Barrier Reef. We must appreciate the many thousands of people who work and live on the Great Barrier Reef and who will help us to achieve this goal, and it's through their work and their expertise that we are fortunate enough to have the best managed reefs in the world. We must work together so that all Australians will continue to enjoy this marvellous wonder now and into the future. We are so lucky to have this in our own backyard. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The genesis of this motion calling for greater scrutiny of industrial-scale, land-intensive intermittent electricity generation projects lies in the distress and despair that are leaving lives in tatters in my seat of Wide Bay. Not too much is more sacred than the family home, and in regional Australia that family home also includes a block of land. It's part of our vernacular: the great Australian dream. That dream involves a block of land for business, to garden, to farm, to keep as native bush or to do whatever you like with because it's your land. Unreliable energy and associated transmission lines are taking our great Australian dream for many of my people and turning it into a nightmare. What people have worked their entire lives or for generations for is under threat by Labor governments intent on making electricity bills more expensive and energy unreliable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One constituent bought her rural block for the trees, but the transmission lines, when finished, will leave her no mature trees on her block whatsoever. Another spent $9,000 planning their dream family home, and the transmission lines would run right through her living room if she built that home; it's completely unviable. People fight for years, writing submissions and enduring meaningless bureaucratic consultation sessions thousands of hours away from their family and work after being channelled into stopping massive transmission lines and industrial-scale energy projects from destroying their homes and communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, climate change minister Chris Bowen announced subsidies for another 32 gigawatts of unreliable energy, equivalent to half the national energy market. He has yet to release the cost, how much land will be required for the projects or how many properties will be acquired to connect them to the grid. For example, a single solar farm in my electorate at Munna Creek requires 460 hectares. The Lower Wonga Solar Farm will require up to 600 hectares. Forest Wind, between Maryborough and Gympie, spreads 226 wind turbines over 226 hectares. Borumba Pumped Hydro will inundate up to 1,500 hectares. At this rate, Wide Bay will be inundated and carpeted in solar panels to achieve Labor's policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Simon Bartlett, the former COO of Powerlink, says the $14.2 billion Borumba scheme will need to be switched off during an El Nino weather event. This Thursday will be another dark day, when Powerlink reveals which properties will go under the proposed Borumba transmission lines to Woolooga, which will involve ripping up between 54 and 83 kilometres of forest. A farmer can't cut down a tree, but foreign developers can flatten thousands of hectares to build wind factories, solar plants and hydro-impoundments, with their transmission lines cutting scars across Wide Bay. Labor's policy is fundamentally flawed and will ultimately be unnecessary, and the landowners are rightfully distressed. So-called renewables supply about 30 per cent of our electricity as it is. To meet the Albanese government's targets, these renewables must supply 82 per cent of the electricity by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Land-intensive, intermittent power generation projects will cause irreversible damage to homes, communities and prime agricultural land while destroying the environment and natural wildlife habitats. The same people who are so strongly advocating this 80 per cent target and espouse the social virtues of countries like Canada and Norway are conspicuously silent when those countries' embrace of nuclear power comes up. For families facing diving property values and places they can't farm or build their homes on anymore, the stress, anguish and mental health toll is rising.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">CHARLTON</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  The member for Wide Bay has raised a range of issues associated with the rollout of renewable energy across Australia—a rollout which is critical for our nation's ability to meet the challenge of the future to address climate change through an energy transition. He talked about land use, intermittency and habitat impacts, but the question here isn't whether the energy transition is hard or not. We all know the energy transition will be one of the greatest economic challenges we face. The question is: what is the alternative to that energy transition? The thing that we know is that the alternative, of not doing anything, will be a disaster. It will condemn future generations to unpredictable and devastating weather that will significantly infringe on our way of life. To get up in this place and complain about the impacts of renewable energy without proposing an alternative shows the essential core of the Liberal and National Party, which is nothing more than rank climate scepticism.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had this for decades—decades of making the perfect the enemy of the good, decades of complaints about the renewable energy transition which ultimately end up in inaction. We had it from Tony Abbott, who in 2009 called the science of climate change 'absolute crap'. In 2017 he referred to renewables like solar and wind as 'intermittent and unreliable power', and now his most recent venture has been to join a climate-sceptic think tank in the UK. Even Malcolm Turnbull was unable to deliver climate change action through his leadership of the Liberal Party. In 2009 he said of the Liberal Party: 'They simply do not believe in human-caused global warming.' He tried as Prime Minister to steer his party towards a more serious position on renewables and could not.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion here today is exactly the problem. It's exactly why we have had 10 years of denial and delay and it's exactly why Australia is now so far behind in the race towards the energy transition and the industries of the future. People who fundamentally don't believe in climate change fall over at the first hurdle of difficulty. Whether it be solving how we manage the energy transition while maximising land use or whether it be finding solutions to the problem of intermittency or to preserving habitats, the opposition fall over at the first hurdle for the simple reason that they do not believe in climate change and do not accept its impacts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the member for Cook, when he was Prime Minister, stood in front of the world at COP26 and declared that the government was acting on climate change 'the Australian way'. The so-called Australian way has, for the last decade, seen four gigawatts of dispatchable power leave the grid and only one gigawatt replace it. That's not the Australian way; that's capitulation. That's a decade of inaction and incompetence by a government that never took climate change and renewable energy seriously.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to look any further than the member for Hume—the former Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction—who advocated against emissions reduction. This is what the member for Hume had to say in 2019. He wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The energy sector, in particular, now has a choice. Should CEOs capitulate to the demands from the green left to prematurely close down coal and gas generators, without regard for customers? Or should they focus more on those quiet Australians in the suburbs and regions, the small businesses they run and the industries they work for?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hume didn't do anything about our energy transition. He oversaw energy capacity leaving Australia's grid. That's fundamentally because he represents a party that doesn't believe in climate change and will therefore always fall over at the first hurdle.</span>

                  </span>The Leader of the Opposition—this is the man who joked about rising sea levels in the Pacific—now wants to be taken seriously on climate change, and his solution, instead of renewables, is nuclear energy. Well, I'm really looking forward to him travelling the nation and explaining that to communities—not about the habitat destruction or land use issues raised by the member for Wide Bay; I'm really looking forward to him explaining that he's going to save that land but put a nuclear reactor in the backyard. That's a conversation we're willing to have. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  The transition to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power has profound implications not only for our environment but also for the very fabric of our communities. We must confront the stark reality that this government's ambitious push towards achieving 82 per cent renewables by 2030 has ignited a recklessness that adversely impacts farmers and regional communities in every corner of our vast nation. The urgency to achieve this renewable energy target has unfortunately led to a hasty approach that neglects the intricate tapestry of our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers, the backbone of our nation, bear the brunt of significant land clearing and invasive construction associated with these renewable energy initiatives. Prime agricultural land, essential for our food security, is sacrificed in the name of progress. The interruption to agriculture businesses, the devaluation of land and the uncertainty that shrouds their future demand a more considered and collaborative approach to ensure the co-existence of sustainable energy initiatives in the vital agriculture sector. Moreover, the rush towards renewables has cast a shadow over regional communities, creating divisions and causing mental anguish among residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not disregard the human toll associated with Labor's commitment to transition to renewable energy at all costs. Our regional communities deserve a future that is not marred by social discord but is characterised by unity, resilience and shared prosperity. These renewable energy initiatives are pitting neighbour against neighbour. Those fortunate enough to receive financial compensation for hosting projects on their land reap the rewards. Meanwhile, those residing in close proximity contend with the devaluation of their land, disruptions to their agriculture operations and the challenging toll on their mental health. Farmers and other landowners find themselves in a precarious position as they grapple with the intricacies of negotiating complex commercial agreements required for renewable energy projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner has heralded a number of issues surrounding renewable energy contracts which would leave the host property to deal with the decommissioning of wind turbines at the end of their operational life. I refer to page 37 of the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner's annual report, where it states: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… some published decommissioning plans have calculated costs … up to $600,000 … If a turbine has a structural failure and is unstable, it could cost millions of dollars to safely remove the turbine from site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To put these costs into perspective, the total fees earned for hosting a turbine for 25 years could be in the range of $250,000—$750,000 …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hence, there exists the possibility that the expense associated with decommissioning a turbine might be equivalent to or even surpass the overall income earned by the landholder throughout the 25-year operational span.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding to the complexity is the fact that these large-scale renewable energy projects involve significant land clearing and invasive construction. The destruction of these natural habitats for renewable energy poses a severe threat to our native wildlife, as many species rely on these for their survival. Lying 175 kilometres north-west of Rockhampton is the Lotus Creek Wind Farm. In June 2020, the former minister for the environment rejected the $100-million Lotus Creek Wind Farm project as it would clear old-growth forests, which are imperative for the protection of vulnerable and threatened species such as the koala and greater glider. Conservationist and filmmaker Stephen Murkowski has said the Lotus Creek project area is worthy of becoming Queensland's great koala national park. This stunning old-growth landscape supports critically endangered wildlife, and we're carving it up for green energy. This must be stopped now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, Labor has given the green light on the Lotus Creek Wind Farm, which will see 55 wind turbines have a direct impact on almost 3,045 hectares of koala habitat. Addressing this multifaceted issue goes beyond the immediate concerns of individual landowners and communities. It speaks to the broader need for fairness and equity. As such, I call on the government to enforce a temporary suspension on large-scale renewable energy projects until amendments are made to the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act requiring the automatic referral of these projects for assessment under the act. I will continue to advocate for an inquiry into the community-wide economic, social and environmental repercussions stemming from these large-scale, irresponsible renewable energy projects.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  This is a hopeless motion that I rise to speak against. There are only two good things about this motion: one, it gives me another chance to outline the very real, necessary and beneficial steps that this government is taking to meet the climate crisis; and two, it portrays the incapacity of the coalition to understand, accept or act on the challenge before us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many portfolio areas in which the coalition is not fit to govern, and I say that climate change is first among them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion uses words like 'industrial scale', 'reckless' and 'untenable'. Industrial scale: there are a lot of things that are industrial scale, especially industries, and that includes renewable industries. This is good. Reckless: well, things are only reckless if they're not necessary. If you agree that they're necessary, then they can't be reckless; they're necessary. And then untenable: the only thing untenable in this debate is the coalition's position, or lack thereof, on climate change and energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also mentions the EPBC process, and I hope that the member for Wide Bay will be a great supporter of the new EPBC Act, a real champion of the new federal EPA. If he is such a believer in environmental protection, we have to ask him: why did his party not take action on the Samuel review and strengthen the act while in government? I expect the member to be backing in the government's changes next year. Let's see what he does. In any event, the act will apply to the right projects to progress change for our climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has the government done thus far to meet the climate change challenge? We've enshrined Australia's emissions targets and legislation with the Climate Change Act of 2022. We've established a purposeful safeguard mechanism to ensure emissions reductions by our largest carbon emitters. We've rolled out six offshore wind zones across Australia to support the transition to 82 per cent renewable power by 2030. We've made record investments in renewables—solar, wind, green hydrogen and storage, transmission through Rewiring the Nation, capacity, and research. We've launched Australia's first Electric Vehicle Strategy and are reviewing our fuel efficiency standards. And we're installing 400 community batteries around Australia to enable households to share in the generation of solar energy. And, yes, there is a lot more, but, of course, I only have five minutes to speak. But I want to give a shoutout to the expansion of capacity investment scheme. This is going to make an absolutely huge difference, and industry are welcoming the announcement by Minister Bowen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion mentions nuclear power. Well, of course it does! But the member for Wide Bay should realise this is a mere pretence. Nuclear is much more expensive and dirty, and the small reactor technology isn't proven. Our top scientists recommend against it. The Liberal Party pretend to be interested in nuclear power for Australia even though they know it doesn't stack up because they want to curry favour with the nuclear industry. The nuclear industry pretend that they don't know it will never happen, perhaps trying to curry favour with investors—and I'll come back to the investors. These meetings that they're having must be wonderful, with everyone in the room pretending they're talking about something real and everyone knowing they aren't. They're a waste of everyone's time when we don't have time to waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December last year the member for Fairfax launched his website Time To Talk Nuclear, and he said he paid for it, but then we learnt that the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney based consulting company whose clients include the US company NuScale Power. Perhaps they both paid for it. It's fishy. But, hey, there's more. Two weeks ago NuScale Power announced it was abandoning its plans to build a small nuclear reactor in Idaho due to—you guessed it!—rising costs. And just last year week we learnt that NuScale Power had been hit with—wait for it—an investor lawsuit over the deal. It's a house of cards. And it's a measure of the coalition's inability to truly grapple with climate change or with energy policy that they chose the member for Wide Bay and the member for Fairfax, with his single-minded, evidence-averse penchant for nuclear, to be the spokespeople in this particular area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor sits in the only position that is tenable. We accept the science and we seek to act in a way that delivers the most benefit to reducing emissions while protecting the economy, looking after community concerns and, most importantly, protecting the environment, which is what this is all about. We seek to achieve the difficult and possible. The Greens criticise us from their comfortable position of never having to govern or make any serious or difficult decisions, and then we have the coalition—and I'm going to put this back on the member for Fairfax, who simply— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have spoken many times on this topic, and now it's starting to become a big issue in many rural communities across Australia. People are becoming painfully aware of the enormous footprint that these renewable energy projects and associated transmission lines will have on the general countryside. Add to that the environmental damage, the social implications, the economic cost, the lack of consultation and the realisation that government policy supporting these proposals has been deliberately designed that way so that these communities cannot stop these projects, regardless of the consequences that these small communities will have to endure.</span>

There are literally dozens of these projects in various stages of the approval process across Central Queensland.

I would like to concentrate on these two aspects in my contribution today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Minister Bowen gave a speech that declared that Australia would have 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, that 22,000 solar panels would need to be built every day between then and 2030, that 40 wind turbines would need to be constructed every month from then to 2030 and that 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines would have to be built to connect all of this infrastructure to the grid. I am yet to read anywhere or hear from any of the so-called experts in the know that this is remotely possible. The practical reality of delivering the government's obsession with renewables has been lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly every day that I sit in parliament the government gives us their rhetoric on how renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy—it happened today in question time—yet people's power bills continue to rise to unaffordable levels. The government made an election commitment to reduce people's power bills by $275, and they have delivered nothing except an increase in power prices. Furthermore, the climate change and energy minister is proposing to increase, fivefold, taxpayer funding of these renewable energy projects. The estimated cost is $1.5 trillion by 2030, in the hope of achieving this unachievable goal of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030. What this will achieve is higher energy prices for the consumer and more subsidies to foreign owned companies who own these projects and produce the components required to build these projects. As far as the climate or the weather is concerned, it will achieve absolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has very large resources of coal, gas and uranium. They are among the cleanest and most economically viable in the world, and we should have the cheapest power in the world, yet this mindless argument of renewable energy is crippling Australian business and industry and is driving that production offshore to places like China, where no such climate or energy policies like Australia's exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living is probably the single biggest issue that concerns most Australians. Families are struggling to pay their electricity bills, secure their mortgages, pay their insurance, buy their groceries, fuel their motor vehicles, educate their children and so on. These cost-of-living pressures are directly related to energy policy, the safeguard mechanism policy and the whole 'net zero carbon by 2050' debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What amazes me is that many people have not yet joined the dots. For example, the safeguard mechanism imposed on industries like the cement industry has forced the price of concrete up. Companies are passing on their costs to the consumer. A house becomes more expensive to build, and therefore an existing house becomes more expensive to buy, making it harder for somebody to save up for a deposit for a house. Wind turbines require several hundred tonnes of concrete to make the footings, making them more expensive to build and therefore requiring more subsidy from the government to achieve their build targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: the unrealistic renewable energy targets, the safeguard mechanism and the 'net zero carbon by 2050' debate are all interrelated and will ultimately deliver economic pain for the Australian consumer and deliver no environmental outcomes for the planet.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  Yet again, we're getting up in this place to debate another cynical attempt by those opposite to undermine Australia's transition to renewable energy. Every week, they come in here with a new attempt to try to delay and derail the nation's switch to renewable energy. Recently, we had the member for Hughes bring a motion blaming potential energy blackouts on renewable energy and then we had the member for Grey, in another motion, scandalously implying that renewable energy is a security risk to Australia. And this is even before we get into the long list of motions on nuclear energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear energy: the coalition were in power for 10 years but are only talking about it now that they're in opposition. This is because those opposite have a deep rooted opposition to renewable energy, and this is yet another attempt to undermine what Australians voted for. It's disheartening to witness a continual effort by the opposition to cast doubt on the very solutions that will lead us to a sustainable and more prosperous future. It's disheartening because, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence and global consensus on the need for sustainable practices, the opposition continues to prioritise short-term political gain over the long-term wellbeing of our planet, our country and its citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of a sudden, in opposition to more renewable energy, the Leader of the Opposition cares about whales. Instead of working with communities to overcome challenges, they will come in here and peddle conspiracy theories over backing proven technologies to combat climate change. Instead of embracing the opportunities that renewable energy represents—job creation, technological advancement and, of course, reduced emissions—the opposition seems determined to deploy tactics designed to hinder progress. And, at a time when the world is transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, the opposition's stance is to cling on to outdated technology that no longer serves the interests of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an era where the global community is grappling with the profound challenges posed by climate change, where we are all struggling with rising fossil fuel energy costs and pressure on household budgets, it's disconcerting to see the Liberals day in, day out oppose renewable energy. Not only are those opposite trying to undermine the important steps by this government; they are actively trying to stop regional communities from receiving the benefits that clean energy can bring to them. Renewable energy projects not only represent a monumental shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy but also create invaluable opportunities for increased work in regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable energy is good for the environment and it's good for jobs. And the more jobs we have, the more prosperous our nation is. Renewable energy zones and their associated infrastructure represent an opportunity to supercharge jobs in our regions. Done right, with the appropriate amount of community consultation, these investments will create well-paid jobs. For the opposition to spread conspiracy theories and cast doubt about these transformative projects is not only irresponsible but undermines the true potential that renewable energy projects hold to enhance the environmental sustainability and economic prosperity of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not only paving the way for more secure, reliable, sustainable energy for our country but prioritising the communities at the heart of these policies, because this government wants the communities where these renewable energy projects are to have a clear stake in the benefits of this nation building investment. Already, our efforts have delivered an impressive commitment to genuine engagement. Changes made to bolster consultation have resulted in meetings with nearly 500 stakeholders and, of course, submissions from right around the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to engage with communities is in stark contrast to the fearmongering tactics employed by those opposite, who seem more interested in running scare campaigns about renewable energy than engaging constructively with the community. The government is actively partnering with states, territories and the transmission network service providers to enhance planning, community engagement and community outcomes for these new renewable energy projects, as we should. The switch to renewable energy is crucial for our nation, is crucial for the environment and is crucial for our economy. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for this motion and I join with the member in acknowledging the impacts the development of renewable energy infrastructure can have on communities, on the environment, on agricultural production and on local businesses. I hear the legitimate concerns that people in my electorate of Indi and across Australia are raising regarding these issues. Regional communities are playing host to almost all the infrastructure needed to deliver Australia's clean energy transition. These communities deserve to be listened to, and their voices need to be part of the decision-making process when it comes to rolling out new solar PV, wind, battery and transmission infrastructure. Importantly, if projects are to be built, these communities should be receiving long-term benefits in return for hosting infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken with landholders and communities across my electorate—from Ruffy, Barnawartha, Dederang, Winton, Bobinawarrah and Meadow Creek. What I've heard from these communities is that, in almost all cases, community engagement and benefit sharing to date has been disappointing at best and non-existent at worst. We need to do better. I hear concerns relating to potential fire risks from batteries or solar PV, I hear concerns around the ability of neighbours to access and afford adequate insurance, and I hear concerns about the logic of using land of high agricultural or environmental value for energy projects. We cannot ignore the mental anguish, stress and community division that emerges when there is uncertainty about proposed renewable energy infrastructure developments. Communities need and deserve answers to their questions, and we should be clear: not every question and not every concern is an objection to renewable energy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a rapid expansion of renewable energy projects if we are to meet the government's targets of a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050. We need to do our fair share to avoid the worst impacts of global heating. Almost all concerned community members I speak to acknowledge and support this expansion—they just want the transition to be done right. If done right, the energy transition can act as an accelerator of economic development and prosperity for regional Australia. If done right, it could be our next gold rush. If done wrong, we risk project delays, we risk our decarbonisation goals and we ignore the genuine concerns of regional communities. We need constructive solutions to deliver positive outcomes for all Australians, and I'm working hard to do just this, by listening to my constituents and working with communities and experts at all levels of government to shift Australia onto the path of a renewable energy transition done right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we're not seeing such constructive action from the coalition. Instead, all we are seeing are attempts to use the legitimate concerns of farmers and landholders in rural Australia as a political tool to stoke division, and that is shameful. With this motion, the member for Wide Bay raises genuine concerns. But this is not a motion put forward in good faith. Oh no, this is an attempt by the coalition to stall necessary progress, to sell nuclear pipedreams and, as a result, to leave Australians without the solutions and to leave Australians divided. I reject these political games played at the cost of all Australians, and I reject them as a regional Australian. We must not divide regional Australia. Instead, I engage in good faith, using what is in the best interests of my constituents and Australia as my guiding compass. I am a strong and practical voice for farmers and regional Australians and I work effectively with communities to advance constructive solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with the many community energy groups across Indi and the country, I developed the local power plan and introduced the Australian Local Power Agency Bill to parliament. More recently, Senator Pocock and I worked with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy to initiate a review into community engagement and benefit sharing around renewable energy infrastructure projects. I ensured that one of the review's round tables took place in Wangaratta and that landholders and community groups were there. I made a detailed submission to the review, with 15 recommendations, including clearly identifying no-go zones not suitable for renewable energy infrastructure development—including land that has very high agricultural or environmental value—ensuring projects do not adversely impact the availability or the affordability of insurance for neighbouring landholders, strong community engagement guidelines requiring developers to conduct honest engagement and requiring all large-scale new developments to offer at least 20 per cent equity to regional communities. I await eagerly the outcome of this review. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for his motion, although I join the member for Indi in questioning his motives in putting this motion forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion leads with transmission lines, and I will talk about those in a moment, but buried near the end of this motion, it calls on the government to conduct a feasibility study into a future sustainable energy source. Guess what that source might be? It's nuclear! What a surprise. I think perhaps the member for Wide Bay has been channelling the other O'Brien in the building, the member for Fairfax, because we know that the member for Fairfax has an unhealthy obsession with nuclear, despite all the experts telling us that it is not the solution for Australia, that in fact the method being proposed by the coalition doesn't even exist in technology. Yet it is the obsession that we hear over and over again from the member for Fairfax and now, it seems, from the member for Wide Bay. It also, of course, conveniently forgets all the forms of renewable energy in which the experts tell us Australia can be a leader, Australia can be a renewable energy superpower. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of all of this is the need to deal with climate change. Australians and this government know we need to be taking action right now to limit the impact of climate change on our world. Australians know we need to be serious about climate action, and that's why 18 months ago they elected our government, to be serious about the challenges that climate change is creating in our communities, to get real and to take real action. Our government has been doing exactly that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that transmission lines are significant infrastructure. They are also absolutely essential to Australia's energy grid and building our energy grid toward zero emissions. It is important that we listen to community concerns. It is also important that we guide the transition towards our renewable energy future. We are supercharging Australia's take-up of renewable energy, because it's good for the climate, it's good for jobs and it's good for households. Emissions reduction and locking in Australia's energy security are vital to communities across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, our government announced another huge step forward in this regard with the expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme. This scheme will secure a reliable energy grid for our country, powered by cleaner, cheaper renewable energy. It makes sure that new energy projects are coming online before the old generators leave, supercharging the available power in the grid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closest thing those opposite have to a plan is pausing the renewable storage investment we desperately need to chase nuclear fantasies and stoking division in local communities. Unlike the coalition, our government understands Australia's huge potential as a renewable superpower and we're working hard to deliver on that promise. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has always been someone who hasn't been afraid to deploy fear to try to get what he wants. But you have to laugh a little, because in the latest frolic into offshore wind, the Leader of the Opposition has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When you look at the whales, and the mother and the calf that we saw out there, the dolphins—all of that is at risk because there's no environmental consideration…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition, now the protector of the whale calf and defender of the environment! It's about as unbelievable as the time he told us he was going to smile more and show us his happy-go-lucky side. Australians can see right through this. Every environment group has said this is not a genuine concern. People know that the opposition is playing politics with really important issues here. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition decided to try and position himself as the great protector of whales and their calves, he did forget a key point. As the Australian Conservation Foundation pointed out, the evidence shows that whales swim around ocean infrastructure. They're quite clever, those whales; they're quite smart, in fact, smarter than those opposite, it seems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will keep working with other governments at state and territory levels, with business, with industry and, most importantly, with local communities as we continue on the path to an ambitious scaling up of renewable energy. What we won't be doing is causing mischief and spreading misinformation, as those opposite and their friends have been doing with transmission lines and with offshore wind. This is irresponsible behaviour. What we won't be doing is selling the ridiculous idea of nuclear energy as Australia's solution to climate change, because every expert tells us it isn't. I'm proud to be part of a responsible government that's doing serious and important work to address a defining challenge of our time, climate change, and to embrace a renewable future that is good for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  As I stand to speak to this motion, I can't help but be bemused by the use of words like 'reckless' and 'economically, socially and environmentally untenable' to describe renewable energy proposals. How can the member for Wide Bay move such a motion in good conscience, knowing we are facing the extraordinary challenge of weaning our society and our economy from our fossil fuel addiction to ensure future generations not only have an environment to live in but one they can survive?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by addressing the fact that this motion conveniently shares just one part of the story. While the motion criticises renewable energy projects for what it claims to be 'significant land clearing and invasive construction', it is silent on the destruction already wrought on our environment by fossil fuel projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently 36,000 kilometres of rail line in Australia, and 80 per cent of the freight carried on those lines is coal or iron ore. In Queensland, coal alone is 12 per cent of freight, while in New South Wales it's 13 per cent. If we assume coal and other fossil fuel make up around 40 per cent of our freight rail, the pro rata footprint is around 14½ thousand kilometres of rail infrastructure. If you add to this the over 1,600 kilometres of pipelines for oil and a further 23,000 kilometres for gas, and then include the existing transmission lines for the Australian fossil fuel based electricity system, at around 40,000 kilometres, we end up with a fossil fuel supply chain footprint in Australia that extends over 80,000 kilometres. By comparison, AEMO estimates that we need 10,000 kilometres of transmission lines to facilitate our energy transition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking this one step further, gas and oil pipelines typically have a 30-metre wide right-of-way corridor, and railways are similar. If you take the 80,000-kilometre footprint and multiply it by the required corridor allowances, 2.4 million square kilometres is currently set aside to accommodate fossil fuel energy generation. By contrast, the highest voltage transmission lines have a 60-metre wide corridor, meaning the new renewable energy infrastructure will have less than half the footprint—just 600,000 kilometres—of the current fossil fuel assets. I ask the member for Wide Bay: as you prepared this motion, did you consider the environmental impacts of the energy system that already exists, or was it just far too convenient to completely overlook them? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me continue by explaining that Australia currently has around 200 known coal deposits and 100 coal mines. The five largest of these produce 87 million tonnes of coal per year. But coal only burns with about 30 per cent efficiency in the conversion to electricity, so from this yield we get about 190,000 gigawatts of electricity per year. Google Earth shows that these mines and associated facilities cover about 292 square kilometres. If that same land was dedicated to commercial solar, it's estimated it would produce 112,000 gigawatts—more than half of what these coalmines do. But the big difference is that the land could be used for a dual purpose, with agrovoltaics making each square kilometre of land significantly more productive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree that we must ensure generation and transmission project standards for renewables meet world's best environmental stewardship practice; however, I suspect our reasons for advocating for this are different. For me, I believe it's important because I want to ensure that, as we transition, we do so in a way which is good not just for humanity but for biodiversity in the wider sense. By contrast I suspect this motion was crafted in this way to ensure existing fossil fuel proponents use it as a tool to delay a cleaner energy future. A cynic would say that this is because those currently involved in the fossil fuel system are determined to extract every dollar out of the Australian market, while polluting our waterways and airways and jeopardising a stable, liveable climate moving forward, and that those who support this sector and have long benefited from donations from it have a vested interest in enabling them to do just that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that said, I don't believe it's unreasonable to consider nuclear power. Australia does, after all, provide a third of the world's uranium. However, I think it is highly unlikely that the Australian public will embrace it, as the challenges of dealing with the waste it produces have not been addressed. It is likely to be far more expensive, and the technology that is suggested in this motion is not only not ready for deployment; it may never be. Ultimately, it would also not be ready to deploy within a climate-necessary time frame. Even if we do pursue nuclear energy, it would require transmission infrastructure, and if we are to accept the premise of this motion—that transmission infrastructure is being rejected—why would it be different for a nuclear project? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the member for Wide Bay really cared about the cost of energy for Australian households, he would be advocating for an overhaul of Australia's Byzantine market rules for our electricity system. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important motion tonight moved by the Deputy Speaker, the member for Newcastle. As her motion acknowledges, there is so much work we still need to do to end violence against women and children in this country. Our government has been very clear that we are committed to ending violence against women and children within a generation. It's not work we can get done overnight, but it is work that we are putting every available lever and tool towards. It is so important that, as we note this motion and as we note this time, we actually look at the facts of what is happening in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of last week, 53 women in Australia have been killed by acts of violence. That's 53 women who have lost their lives and 53 families, parents, children, other family and friends who now go on without that loved one. One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence perpetrated by a man since the age of 15. We know that violence affects women from every age group, from every cultural background and from every corner of this country—women with different jobs, levels of education and income. So it is essential that we get on and we do the work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, our government has not wasted a moment in taking immediate and practical steps to prevent violence against women. We have invested a record $2.3 billion in this area to implement the ten-year National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children, as well as other women's safety initiatives. We have legislated ten days of paid family and domestic violence leave for all employees, including casuals. This is a well overdue reform that organisations and advocates have been calling on for some time. It's a reform that recognises that violence effects women, as I said earlier, across all levels of education and income and across all types of work. That is why it is so important that these ten days of leave are universal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the national plan, our government has also developed an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander action plan that reflects the need for targeted action for First Nations women and children, who are disproportionately impacted by family and domestic violence. We know that concrete action is needed. We know that this work is best led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, who understand what is happening in their communities and who can best advocate for ways through this really, really difficult problem. The first step to reducing the rates of violence is to fully understand the scope of the problem, and we have invested $15 million for First Nations led research that's collecting data and evidence to ensure funding is delivered where it's needed most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also funded a three-year trial to explore the best ways to counteract the harmful impacts of social media messaging that targets young men and boys and instead ensure that young men learn how to have healthy, respectful relationships. This will be delivered both face to face, including through sessions at sporting clubs and other organisations, and through online engagement. I know that this is such a concern for many people, particularly people with both young girls and young boys, who see this playing out in their own households and their own lives. Other changes our government has made include reducing the time it takes for victims-survivors to access the escaping violence payment—the payment that allows them to feel like they can leave a dangerous situation—and securing funding for states and territories to deliver frontline services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Saturday marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the start of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. The day before, on Friday, local organisations from my community participated in Respect Victoria's Walk against Family Violence, joining with people across the state to stand together against violence, including my local state colleague Vicki Ward MP, the Victorian Minister for Prevention of Family Violence. I recognise the year-round work, at all times of the day, from so many support services—all those who work in the family, domestic and sexual violence sector, including the services and workers in my community. Just across the road from my electorate office in Heidelberg is the Orange Door. It's one of those services doing vital work to support victims-survivors and their families and doing critical work on the prevention of violence as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence against women and children is a national tragedy. There can be absolutely no complacency in our approach to this problem. Our government is using all the levers available to it to tackle this problem. It will take time, but we are getting on with trying to tackle this entrenched problem in our community to say that enough is enough. We will not stand for women and children being harmed at the rates we currently see.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Newcastle for bringing forward this very important motion and for allowing me the opportunity to speak on it. This past Saturday, 25 November, was International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, commencing 16 days of activism against gender based violence. It is a poignant annual reminder that we need to do better as a society and better as a government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent reports of the deaths of five Australian women at the hands of their partners--men who reportedly loved them--in just 10 days were devastating and alarming. More than one woman is killed every week, and these stories are, sadly, unfamiliar. In my own electorate, we have some of the most concerning family violence statistics in the state. We as parliamentarians have to ask ourselves what further steps we as government can take to do better to prevent these tragedies from re-occurring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the work that is being done by the current ministers, because it should be bipartisan, and recognise the good work that the ministers and shadow ministers have been doing and are doing for the prevention of family violence. I thank them for their continued commitment and for their heartfelt statements in this place to date. Hearing the similar goals, policies and planning benchmarks provided by each as we work towards eradicating this scourge from Australian society concisely reaffirms the bipartisan approach that is already in place, in this place, and must continue to drive meaningful change. I appreciate that the current government has the same noble intentions as the one that preceded it and the strong desire to move the dial further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past 18 months as the shadow assistant minister for the prevention of violence, I've travelled to Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland and, of course, my state in New South Wales. I've spoken to organisations who are currently at the coalface when it comes to prevention and response to family and domestic violence. During that time, I have consistently heard the analogy that these agencies feel like they are the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, spending infinite time and resources on the clean-up and not being allowed to focus on providing that fence to protect potential victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these agencies have seen great success in their grassroots men's behavioural and community group education programs, and they need the right supports to be able to expand them. I recently sat with Kempsey Families Inc, which provides holistic services across family units and continually strives to adapt programs to best cater to the whole unit. To be able to expand these programs efficiently, they need a separate space for men and women so that each participant feels safe and catered to. This is a sensible and considered approach to properly addressing prevention, intervention, response and recovery. I have concerns the government, both on this side and the current government, continue to focus the majority of the available budget on the back end of the domestic violence cycle while putting less than 18 per cent into the total dedicated budget towards prevention programs. It is where we stand as a government today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Response is extremely important. I'm not saying in any way that our domestic and family violence response agencies are not stretched, and they deserve every cent they get, but we need to address the problem. Let's not beat around the bush: the facts are that eight out of 10 men are the offenders. We need to put in place the funding and the programs for men's behavioural change and men's support networks to change that generational thinking, because a male victim child today quite potentially becomes a male offender tomorrow. Let's focus on prevention. Let's fund prevention and let's do it today.</span>

                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  On Saturday, community members from across my electorate of Corangamite reflected on one of the most insidious challenges facing our nation today: violence against women. It was International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the first day of the 16 days of activism to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls around the world. The theme of this year's campaign is 'UNITE! Invest to prevent violence against women and girls'. The campaign calls for global action to increase awareness, promote advocacy and create opportunities for discussion on challenges and solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government recognises that violence against women remains one of the most entrenched human rights violations in the world. Globally, an estimated 736 million women have been subjected to physical and/or sexual intimate-partner or non-partner violence, or both, at least once in their life. We know that, here in Australia, too many women and children experience gender based violence every day. The statistics are never easy to hear. One in three women have experienced intimate partner violence since the age of 15. This month alone, more than 40 women have been killed by acts of violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can no longer ignore the brutal reality of domestic violence. That's why I stand today in support of this motion, moved by the member for Newcastle, and I thank the member for moving it. Violence against women and children is horrific, tragic and insidious, and we need to act with urgency. That's why the Albanese government has legislated a suite of groundbreaking reforms and made significant investments to address this issue. It's why we're committed to ending violence against women and children—violence that is often hidden in plain sight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first reforms introduced by our government was 10 days of paid family violence leave for all employees, including casuals, because no one should be left to choose between their safety and their financial security. We've also taken immediate and practical steps to support victims of family and domestic violence, including a record $2.3 billion investment. We've fixed the escaping violence payment, reducing the time it takes victims-survivors to access support by 22 days. The difference this will make for some victims-survivors will be immeasurable. We have also extended funding for states and territories to deliver frontline services. We're delivering new frontline and community-sector workers to support victims-survivors of family violence, with funding to support the first group of workers now flowing to states and territories, and we have established a set of actions under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are significant reforms and investments, but our government acknowledges that we still have a long way to go. Statistics from Victoria Police show that, just last year, there were approximately 4,800 cases of domestic violence in local government areas across my electorate alone. It's shocking and it's unacceptable. These women come from all walks of life—different ages, cultures, professions and backgrounds—but they share a heartbreaking story: their lives and their children's lives have been tragically cut short or brutally upended at the hands of a current or former partner. These women are aunties, sisters, daughters, friends and colleagues. They are women we have loved and women we have lost too soon. This must change, and the perception of family violence must change. We need to shatter the perception that family violence happens elsewhere, not in our own backyards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, and to mark this significant week for women across our nation, I'd like to share the words of the victims-survivors contained in the opening statement of our government's national plan:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Abuse and violence is a problem for victims, but it is not the victims' problem. Genuine change begins with a willingness to listen. We must stop protecting perpetrators with our silence, and through inaction. We must be willing to sit in discomfort. It is time to be brave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is time to act.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion brought by the member for Newcastle. Today, like many others in this place and in the other, I'm wearing orange in support of the 16 days of activism against gender based violence. As part of the coalition, I welcome the member for Newcastle's motion to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. In my home city of Sydney in New South Wales, only a couple of weeks ago a young woman aged only 21, Lilie James, was violently murdered, allegedly at the hands of a former male partner. This murder committed at a school shocked Sydney and shocked Australia. However, Lilie was one of 55 women this year who have been murdered at the hands, allegedly in Lilie's case, of a male partner. Improving the safety of women and children must be above politics, and we on our side will continue to work with the government towards the elimination of violence against women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across this nation every day, family and domestic violence harms Australian women and children. Many of these incidents go unreported. Unfortunately, although we are in 2023, we are not seeing an improvement in the reduction of reported incidents or deaths from this violence. It is simply not good enough, and we must do better. In fact, some of the statistics are showing that the number of domestic homicides is getting worse. It is a national crisis and a national disgrace. I do applaud the Albanese Labor government for pledging over a year ago to end gender based violence in a generation. This is laudable; it is a worthy commitment. The National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children and the recently released First Action Plan must translate the words and the allocated funding into tangible and effective action that saves lives. Part of these actions must focus on improving community education around this scourge. It needs to dismantle the common view that family violence only occurs with aggressive behaviours and that family violence only occurs in certain demographics. This is not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In reality, family violence presents in many forms, including emotional, financial, spiritual, cultural and coercive control. Coercive control takes the form of threats, intimidation, humiliation and other abuse that erodes a person's autonomy and ability to flourish. In that regard, I particularly acknowledge the work of the former New South Wales coalition government led by the Hon. Mark Speakman and the Hon. Natalie Ward. Twelve months ago, the New South Wales government passed legislation making coercive control a standalone criminal offence in New South Wales. This was the first law of its kind in Australia, if not in the world. Coercive control is a form of domestic abuse that involves patterns of behaviour that have the cumulative effect of denying victims-survivors their autonomy and their independence. We need the whole community to understand the forms that this violence can take and to be alert to its indicators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also have a more pointed commitment to early intervention programs and prevention strategies. These strategies must particularly include a focus on education and support programs for Australian boys and men. As the mother of boys I feel that this education must begin at its earliest, in those formative preschool years, so that boys understand respect for women and that violence against women is never, ever acceptable. Another area that could be improved is the rehabilitation of family violence offenders before they're released from custody. This, again, is something that must be addressed while we are in this place. To conclude, the tackling of family violence must be above politics in this place. It is above politics. I have been so heartened to see the number of us today who are wearing orange in support of this important day and to hear all the speeches from across the floor in support of the elimination of violence against women.</span>
