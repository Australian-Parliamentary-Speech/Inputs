                <span class="HPS-Small">That the rules for remote participation in Senate proceedings recommended by the Procedure Committee in its first report of 2020 have effect during the sittings of the Senate from 24 August to 3 September 2020.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This sitting fortnight will be the first time that senators will be able to participate in proceedings remotely. This is obviously in the context of the ongoing effect around Australia of the coronavirus pandemic and a desire to ensure that our workplace in the Senate is as COVID-safe as possible while facilitating participation by all senators as appropriate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rules that have been agreed to by the Procedure Committee have been developed on the principle that the proceedings of the Senate are to be managed in the Senate by those senators present in the Senate chamber. Importantly, senators participating remotely can participate in any matter that is before the chair but are limited to being able to only move amendments and request for amendments to legislation in Committee of the Whole. The general principle for remote participation is that those colleagues who are participating remotely will be able to participate in relation to any issue that is before the chair but can't themselves bring matters before the chair, with the exception of amendments to legislation in Committee of the Whole.</span>

First, I thank the Procedure Committee for their work in collaboratively preparing the rules for participation in these proceedings. I would emphasise that the rules reflect the principle of the primacy of parliament and that proceedings have to be managed in the chamber; hence the parameters for remote participation. I would also emphasise that these are interim arrangements and that we would be keen to ensure that the Procedure Committee review the operation of the order after the fortnight. Mr President, I thank you for your assistance on this and, in particular, I thank the Deputy President for shepherding this work through.</span>

The Greens have always said that the parliament can and should proceed, as long as the health advice says that it's safe to do so. That's why we did not support the suspension of parliament, effectively for six months, back in March. It is our view that there remained other ways to manage parliament sitting and that a suspension was not justified.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been calling on the government to allow for remote participation in parliament for some time, and we are disappointed that it has taken this long to get to the place that we are now. It is clear that, like other workplaces across Australia, the federal parliament can and should continue to operate. I will, of course, acknowledge that we have all been very active and working very hard remotely and in our offices and participating in endless Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex and Skype meetings—and other virtual meetings; whatever virtual medium there is, we have been using it. But the parliament has not been sitting. Other workplaces have been adapting since the beginning of the year, yet the parliament has taken this long to get to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not have missed the two important weeks of parliament at the beginning of the month simply because we didn't have this process in place. However, we are very pleased that it is now in place—and, as you can see, some of our Greens senators are up there on the screen; I can't see from here who the other person is. Senators should be able to carry out their duties remotely. Things such as moving motions are an important part of representing our constituencies. So the Greens, as noted in the procedure committee report that was tabled on Friday, are disappointed that senators are excluded from participating in some of the processes that operate in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do understand that meeting in parliament and section 20 of the Constitution is very important, but we are disappointed that some of the processes that are available when you're here in the Senate are not available to those participating remotely. We do appreciate that senators can participate in the Committee of the Whole. That is very important, but we're disappointed that they can't participate in some of the other processes that are available in the Senate, and during the review process that Senator Wong mentioned we would like to ensure that we look at how we can open the process up to enable participation in some of the wider processes that are available to the senators in the chamber.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  With that, I'd like to formally welcome our colleagues who are attending remotely for the first time. Now that the Senate has adopted the rules for remote attendance, rather than go through a series of procedures I simply ask that those attending remotely strictly follow the advice of the chair. Senators will be very familiar with this system, having used it extensively for dozens of committee hearings since April. I'd like to thank officials from the Department of Parliamentary Services for their extensive work over this period, with officials of the Department of the Senate, to ensure that those committee hearings and now this remote attendance can function so smoothly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, there are several issues I need to address to the Senate now that we have allowed remote participation and commenced this sitting. First, the COVID-safe measures adopted earlier this year regarding chamber operations remain in place. Other measures have been instituted regarding building operations, including recommendations about mask use in certain areas, and I urge senators to familiarise themselves with the statements made by the Speaker and I last Monday and last Friday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, regarding the sittings scheduled for earlier this month, on 18 July I made a statement advising that the sittings scheduled for the weeks of 4 and 11 August would not take place. This followed my receipt of a request to that effect made by Senate leaders representing more than three-quarters of senators. That request reflected the health situation then unfolding in Victoria and advice from the Acting Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer. I wrote to all senators on 20 July confirming my statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first time scheduled sittings have been set aside in this way. After seeking advice, I took the view that the principles that had been applied by my predecessors in taking action to delay the commencement of sittings were also relevant here. There are numerous precedents for presidents altering the commencement of sittings in light of extraordinary circumstances or, as occurred on 12 June this year, for reasons connected to the conduct of Senate business. These have occurred with the concurrence of senators, demonstrating the principle that the Senate controls its own meetings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key factor in my decision on this occasion was that the request was effectively made on behalf of more than three-quarters of senators so that, if the scheduled sitting had gone ahead, it would not be possible to establish or maintain a quorum. This particular point is critical as, despite different arrangements in the other place occasionally attracting disproportionate attention, it remains the case that the government cannot unilaterally cancel a sitting of the Senate. In my view, this high threshold of such action being taken only when a quorum would not be possible protects the autonomy of the Senate to determine its own meetings. I table the statement and the health advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in my statement of 6 August, when announcements were made specifically impacting senators and members from Victoria, I flagged that, when we next met, I would raise the issue of the effective controls on the movement of senators undertaking parliamentary business in the Senate. Let me say at the outset: this should not be seen in any way as a criticism of health officials with whom I, and many others, have worked over this period. I would like to express my personal and professional thanks to them for the assistance they have provided to senators and officials during this challenging time. A very difficult situation, dealing with the unique work of senators, has been made more manageable by their professionalism and understanding. I would particularly like to thank the officials in the ACT and Commonwealth health departments with whom a number of us have worked very closely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these controls on movement raise, and occasionally challenge, an important principle, and I feel a responsibility to bring this directly to the Senate. It does not necessarily need to be addressed immediately, but to let it pass without mention risks a precedent being established through simple inertia or acceptance. The restrictions on movements currently in place under various state and territory health orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic are now clearly impacting the ability of senators to undertake parliamentary work and even, in some cases, attend parliamentary proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, there was an order in place in South Australia that affected South Australian senators by imposing requirements for quarantine upon their return from the sitting of parliament. This directly impacted the ability of parliamentarians and office holders to undertake their work—in some cases, directly related to parliamentary proceedings. This was imposed by officials of the government of South Australia—that is, the executive. As part of our ongoing work to resolve this, legal advice was sought, but the issue was resolved after productive informal discussions without the need for the Speaker and myself to formally intervene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent announcement that, as a condition of attending parliament, Victorian parliamentarians and, in some cases, their families will be required to undergo a period of quarantine and testing represented a new imposition—notably, one I am not aware has any precedent at the Commonwealth level. Again, this was an imposition of the executive—in this case, at both the Commonwealth and ACT levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have now seen officials of the executives of two states, Queensland and Tasmania, effectively impose new quarantine requirements upon senators returning from a sitting of parliament through the removal of exemptions or classifications previously in place. The Western Australian government has also removed a broad based exemption applying to members of the Commonwealth parliament, although placing less onerous restrictions on returning parliamentarians than Queensland or Tasmania imposed. These quarantine requirements do not prevent travel to attend a subsequent sitting of parliament, but they do restrict various other activities parliamentarians may undertake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also table the letter I received from the    Queensland Chief Health Officer which I circulated to senators last week and copies of the letters sent by the Tasmanian State Controller to senators for Tasmania, and the Western Australian State of Emergency Coordinator to senators for Western Australia, both of which had been forwarded to me. These letters outline the changed arrangements for senators from those states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not normal times. We have both imposed and accepted controls placed on citizens that are unique in our own lifetimes. So many of our fellow Australians have had to find new ways to work. But, even in my home town of Melbourne, under stage 4 lockdown at the moment, it is accepted that some people must travel to work. There is an element of the work of parliament and parliamentarians that is unique and cannot entirely be replicated remotely. While some elements of this can now be addressed through remote attendance and participation, at this stage, that is a limited facility in that a vote cannot be exercised, and, surely, exercising a vote is a key and fundamental element of participating as a member of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The right of those elected to attend and participate in parliament is an ancient one. For good reason the ability of others, including the executive, to restrict this has always been limited. The powers and immunities that enable and secure the work of the two Commonwealth houses belong to the houses themselves by constitutional design—a design which ensures that the Senate, in particular, can undertake its functions with an appropriate degree of independence. The ability to scrutinise the executive and participate in legislative activity is unarguably even more critical in times of crisis due to the extraordinary powers being delegated, granted and exercised by officials and the executive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the current pandemic, an important principle is at stake: notably, the ability of the executive or its officers, no matter the jurisdiction, to control attendance at parliament or constrain the work of members of parliament when it's directly related to parliamentary proceedings. A further complicating factor is the claimed ability, in some cases, to use discretion to determine which senators or members are allowed to attend parliament or have burdens placed upon them. In the case of the ACT, permits were granted to ministers to attend events prior to the sitting of parliament, but the attendance of senators and members to a session of parliament on the same basis was denied and claimed to be prohibited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of Tasmania, the correspondence from the State Controller outlines consideration of exemption from the quarantine requirements on a case-by-case basis. This claimed discretion is particularly problematic on the grounds of differential treatment of members of the executive in the first instance and lack of transparency around the equality of treatment of senators in the second instance. The explanation that the medical risk posed by the entry of a single minister is lower and therefore allowable as opposed to a group attending an actual session of parliament is a circular one with a dangerous consequence in that it establishes a preference for members of the executive attending events not directly related to parliamentary proceedings but then effectively claims the power to control or prohibit parliamentarians' attendance at actual parliamentary proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unilateral action by executives—whether Commonwealth, state or territory—that impede the performance of Commonwealth parliamentary functions are problematic from a constitutional perspective. This remains the case even where, as is the case with border restrictions and quarantine requirements imposed at a state and territory level, that action is founded on or in aid of genuine public health advice and goals. However, these problems may be largely avoided where the requisite action, in this case a response to the public health advice, is developed cooperatively by the institutions concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach taken during this public health crisis will doubtless set precedents that will be looked to in the future. We all know and, indeed, support the public health messages that outline the need for caution, as this pandemic will likely be with us for some time, but the national parliament is a critical part of government, which we are relying on through various agencies and experts to manage our response and care for the health and interests of our fellow Australians. In my view, simple acquiescence to these new assertions of control by officials of the executive of the Commonwealth, state or territories—including, somewhat extraordinarily, the territory established as the seat of government that we are constitutionally required to assemble in—poses a risk in that we cannot envisage how it may be used, or potentially even misused, at a future time in circumstances we cannot imagine. I doubt any of us imagined the current circumstances only a year ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Principles not defended in difficult times are in effect mere customs or conveniences. As I said earlier, this issue does not need to be addressed immediately, but, in my view as your President, I must bring this issue to your attention so as not to inadvertently allow a precedent to be established by default. I lay the matter before the Senate for its consideration at a time of its choosing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  by leave—I rise to speak briefly in relation to your statement. I start at the outset by indicating that we appreciate that you have taken your responsibilities in this office as encompassing some guardianship of this institution, and we respect and value that. We endorse, in particular, the point you make:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ability to scrutinise the executive and participate in legislative activity is unarguably even more critical in times of crisis due to the extraordinary powers being delegated, granted and exercised by officials and the executive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, parliamentary democracy needs a parliament. It's not an optional extra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ceding untrammelled power to the executive is not who we are, and it's also risky. So I place on record our disappointment and concern as to some of how we have got here and, in particular, the way in which Mr Morrison sidelined a working group which was working towards resolving how it would be that this parliament could meet safely. As you might recall, the presiding officers, government and opposition managers of business and chief medical officers were meeting to ensure this was done collaboratively, and, regrettably, the Prime Minister unilaterally commissioned advice and sidelined the working group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament and the executive are separate institutions, and we each have a separate and unique responsibility within our system of government. The executive ought not and cannot interfere with the parliament. Given this, and in light of your statement, the opposition invites the presiding officers to consider for the purposes of future sittings the merit of obtaining independent medical advice to enable the parliament to do its job, and we again reiterate that the Procedure Committee process, by which aspects of the parliament for remote attendance has been agreed, demonstrates the capacity of this parliament to act collaboratively in response to that advice. As I said, Mr President, we thank you for your statement and again acknowledge your guardianship of this institution at these times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Thank you, senators. If no-one else is seeking the call, we will move on.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I rise to speak to the Australian Greens Fair Work Amendment (COVID-19) Bill 2020 that I introduced in the Senate during the last sitting. This bill will protect all workers during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are living through unprecedented times—I don't know how many people have said that or how many times, but it is true: COVID-19 is drastically changing our way of life. This is a global health crisis with no-one left untouched by its impacts. This is a difficult time for all of us, there's no doubt. This is a strange time. This is not a normal time. This is a crisis that touches every aspect of our lives: our wellbeing, our economy, our society and our day-to-day lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why what we do, how we make sure that we do everything possible so we can keep our parliament going, is absolutely important. People out there, Australians, are relying on their leaders to make sure that no-one is left behind. As our country responded to public health in this evolving situation, the unemployment rate hit 7.5 per cent in July—and that particular survey was completed before the stage 4 lockdown in Victoria. In its mini budget update, the government predicted the rate could hit nine per cent by the end of the year. What is clear is that too many people are being left behind during this crisis, and, whilst JobKeeper provides some support, many people in precarious work, casual employment or on a temporary working visa have been denied access to JobKeeper, and many do not have paid leave to rely on. This makes them some of the most vulnerable workers in Australia. We are on a cliff, and we need the government to make sure that no-one falls off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This virus is going to be with us for a while. There is much uncertainty around when we will be able to relax restrictions or end shutdowns and reopen businesses. Amongst all this, we must make sure that we act to protect workers. This is our responsibility as elected members, and this is exactly what this bill that is in front of us will do. This bill will provide 14 days of paid COVID-19 leave to all workers, including permanent, part-time, casual and gig economy workers. This leave will be available in full for each 12-month period from the start of their employment, and the leave will not accrue year to year. Paid COVID-19 leave will be available for workers in any of the following scenarios: the employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19; the employee is unable to attend work because the employee's workplace has been shut down because of COVID-19; the employee is subject to self-isolation or quarantine measures in accordance with Commonwealth, state or territory policy relating to COVID-19; or the employee is caring for another person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or is subject to self-isolation or quarantine measures in accordance with Commonwealth, state or territory policy relating to COVID-19. Paid COVID-19 leave is extended to gig economy workers and contractors via a COVID-19 leave order. Workers, unions and corporations can apply for a COVID-19 leave order. In circumstances where the Fair Work Commission is issuing a COVID-19 leave order, the Fair Work Commission must make a determination within two days of the application being made, and the Fair Work Commission must make the order unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. For employees other than casual workers, payment will be made at the best rate of pay for the employee's ordinary hours of work in the period. For other workers, such as casuals and those in the gig economy, payment will be calculated at the daily rate of pay equal to the average of the daily rates of pay paid to the employee over the previous 12-month period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the above, I will be moving an amendment to this bill so that paid COVID-19 leave is funded by the government by amending the Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits) Act 2020. Employees would be able to receive payments from the federal government for COVID-19 leave payments to their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just us saying this. The ACTU and Business Council, on 3 August, urged the government to implement a national paid pandemic leave scheme funded by the federal government and, where necessary, state governments. Their letter to the Attorney-General states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regrettably, recent events in Victoria have demonstrated that there are insufficient measures in place to enable workers who should not be attending their workplaces to stay home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They go on to say, 'Paid pandemic leave is now an essential public health measure.' With unions, businesses and public health experts all backing paid pandemic leave, it's time for the government to show that they are ready to treat workers' health and public health with the utmost seriousness that it deserves and vote for this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a vital piece of legislation that will protect workers, and it will protect our community. Every worker should be able to self-isolate when required without losing their income or their job. But, right now, over 3.3 million Australians cannot access paid sick leave. This bill is about fairness. The public health crisis has only further highlighted the precarious nature of casual employment and the plight of those who work in casual employment and the gig economy. They work largely without benefits such as paid leave, sick leave and other entitlements that are simply fundamental, basic, to work rights. People should not be forced to choose between caring for their health and coming to work.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent events in Victoria have shown the public health and economic crisis posed by precarity. Over 1,100 Victorian aged-care workers have contracted coronavirus. One in four Melbourne nursing homes have had a coronavirus outbreak. Outbreaks in aged-care homes have resulted in complete staff shutdowns at aged-care facilities in Victoria, resulting in the national cabinet last week announcing an aged-care preparedness plan with incentives for interstate workers to travel interstate to work in facilities experiencing staff shortages. It is telling that aged-care workers were the first to be given paid pandemic leave during the second lockdown in Victoria. This highlights their exposure to the virus and the need to protect workers across Australia, no matter which sector they work in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian and federal governments' responses in guaranteeing paid pandemic leave to workers in Victoria during the lockdown was an admission that granting workers access to this type of leave is vital to tackle the crisis. The federal government now needs to commit to giving all workers—permanent, part time, casual or in the gig economy—timely access to this essential support to avoid more outbreaks in the future and to take care of the people who live here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will say that the purpose of this bill has been fulfilled by their pandemic leave disaster payment. This is not enough. This payment is only available to states and territories who have declared a state of disaster. Every worker, no matter where they live and work, should have access to paid pandemic leave. This will protect their health and their income. The government needs to support Australia's most vulnerable workers and provide a safety net to ensure that everyone has access to at least 14 days of paid pandemic leave, regardless of whether a state of disaster has been declared. We should be acting to prevent disasters now before we see a repeat of the terrible events in Melbourne. The idea that we would wait until a disaster to support workers in crisis is really perverse. Workers are needing to self-isolate during testing and while they're infected, now. The virus doesn't care whether a government has declared a state of disaster or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these difficult times—or really ever—it simply isn't fair that so many Australians are missing out on vital paid leave, left to fend for themselves in this once-in-a-century crisis. We must pass this bill today and look after all workers. This government must step in and support workers and their rights to fair conditions. When wages have been stagnant and the cost of living is rising—literally, going through the roof—it is absurd that this government denies support to workers who are facing weeks, if not months, of under- or unemployment brought on by a global pandemic that few could have predicted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill not only protects workers; it also protects the wellbeing of our community and our economy and advances public health. It's simple: when a worker has no access to paid leave, they are more likely to continue to work when they are unwell or experiencing symptoms of the virus. We must not push workers to the brink, many of whom have been and will continue to be on the front line and in some of the most precarious working conditions. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly agreed with this logic back in May, stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there are a number of workplaces around Australia where there are disincentives for people to stay at home when they are sick.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That can be financial or it can be a workplace culture. I just want to make this very clear: people coming to work when they are sick puts others at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that we're not forcing workers into a situation where, by self-isolating, they cannot afford to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. The widespread downturn and shutdown of Australian businesses has caused millions of casual and gig economy workers to be pushed towards the poverty line. We must not stand by and let this continue to happen. The Prime Minister is abandoning casual workers, gig economy workers, university workers and childcare workers. This bill is the government's chance to redeem themselves somewhat—to stand up for working Australians and to protect some of the most vulnerable during this very difficult time. We must emerge from these exceptionally hard times as a society which has shown, without doubt, that we care for each other, that we care for fairness, that we care for equality. The government must lead, support and reassure workers and their employers. Too many have been left behind, and these pressures felt by people with reduced or no access to leave to go to work when the public health advice is to stay home will only continue. We need the government to step in and guarantee 14 days of paid COVID-19 leave to every worker, regardless of their visa status or whether they are a member of the permanent part-time, casual or gig economy workforce.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will save lives. I call upon the government, upon Labor and upon crossbenchers to urgently make this bill law, for the sake of workers and for the sake of our communities. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  The government does not support this one-size-fits-all bill amending the Fair Work Act. As proposed, it won't be effective, it won't be scalable and it won't be quick, and so the government will be opposing the Greens' bill, the Fair Work Amendment (COVID-19) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to start off my contribution to this debate by talking a bit about how businesses and how Queenslanders have been working and coping with COVID-19 over these past few months. One of the things that I've found as I've travelled around Queensland—and I've been everywhere from out to Eromanga in the south-west corner, up to Windorah, and up to the Far North quite a few times—driving around my home state, is that when I speak to and listen to Queenslanders, they are very much relieved that Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister and that the national cabinet, under his leadership, has worked together and has worked to save lives and protect livelihoods. In particular, businesses, and those who work in the businesses, are so appreciative of what the government has done through the JobKeeper program. The positive impact that JobKeeper has had on protecting businesses and saving livelihoods in Queensland should not be underestimated. It is making sure that, when we get through coronavirus and when there is a vaccine and when Australia is safe, there will be businesses standing up and there will be millions of people working in those businesses. I don't know who can take credit for the JobKeeper program. I don't know whether Mr Morrison or Mr Frydenberg can take credit for it or whether it was a collective effort of the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet, but I'm grateful for what it has done to protect the economy of Australia and I know many businesses and employees in Queensland are grateful for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we mustn't forget that the money that is being used to fund these programs is money that is being spent on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. It is money that has been earned by those working, whether as pay-as-you-go taxpayers or those working in businesses. Their blood, sweat and tears goes towards these taxes, and any government, whether at a territory, state or Commonwealth level, needs to make sure that the money we expend on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia is spent appropriately and soberly. We should not forget that the money that is being spent at the moment to save the Australian economy is not money that is sitting in a vault of the Reserve Bank. It's not sitting hidden in the Treasurer's office. It is money that we are borrowing. It is money that we are borrowing to ensure that we have a today, but it is money that will have to be repaid by the taxpayers of tomorrow, of next year and of decades time. That's why, to someone who sits on the Right of politics, it is sometimes concerning when you really listen to what the Left say. They're very, very good at spending other people's money. They're very, very good at wanting to spend money—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McGRATH:</span>
                    </a>  without recourse to what the achievement of those taxpayers has been in working to save that money—and I will take those interjections. This government has made sure that the money that we have spent—and it is an eye-watering amount—is money that has been spent to ensure that there will be businesses and employees standing up once we get through this pandemic. However, I do fear that those on the Left might sometimes think that this is a perfect opportunity in which to just spend and spend and spend and borrow and borrow and borrow. The line sometimes does have to be drawn because we do have to stand up for the taxpayers of Australia. We do have to stand up for those who are going to come after us and who will have to pay off this quite large debt. We've got to look at what has been the strategic objective of the Prime Minister and the national cabinet since the coronavirus pandemic began. It is all about saving lives and protecting livelihoods and ensuring that, when we deal with coronavirus, we suppress it as much as possible, so we can ensure that the economy keeps going until a vaccine is found and Australians are vaccinated against the coronavirus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all aware that this pandemic is taking a heavy toll on Australia, on individuals, on families and on communities. We are all aware of the impact, especially in my home state of Queensland, where we have a Labor government that has not just one eye on the upcoming state election in 68 days time, but two eyes on it. Everything that our Premier does is in the context of how she's positioning herself for this upcoming state election, and that is disappointing, especially how she is using the politics of border wars to divide people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a situation in Queensland where those who live in border communities are facing immense stress. I speak as someone who lives broadly in a border community. I live on the Southern Downs. We have seen situations in Queensland where a mum has given birth in northern New South Wales but has been unable to visit her newborn baby who had to be transported to hospital in Queensland. We've seen a situation in Queensland where children were unable to go and see their dying father. My mum texted me over the weekend that one of her friends was unable to go to her own brother's funeral. This is the situation we're facing in Queensland, where we have a government who are quite happy to use coronavirus as an alibi to cover up their failed record on the economy and their failed record in Queensland. We have a state government who had, before coronavirus came along, the highest levels of business bankruptcies and the lowest levels of business confidence. The only thing that has been saving Queensland has been the actions taken by this federal government in relation to the JobKeeper payments and the other payments that have been put out by the government and also through the JobSeeker supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is somewhat ironic that there are parts of Queensland calling out for workers to come and work on farms, to go and pick the fruit. It is something that I've picked up in my travels around Queensland—that there are jobs going in Queensland, but they are in regional Queensland. I would encourage people to move to regional Queensland. I live there. My office is in a different region. I love all of Queensland. But, for some reason, sometimes people don't want to shift. I'd say to them: There is work there. Go west. Go north. It may not be work that you like, but it is work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are supporting people through JobKeeper and JobSeeker, and the government's pandemic leave disaster payment is another such support measure. We have put it in place to support those who don't have paid leave entitlements remaining yet have been directed to isolate for 14 days when they otherwise would have been working. We've put this program in place quickly. It was announced on 3 August. Services Australia started accepting claims on 5 August, and payments started flowing a day later, on 6 August. Already almost 7,000 claims from residents and nonresidents have been received and over $8 million has been paid to those in need. We are doing everything we possibly can to support those who have been told to self-isolate or quarantine. Workers with no paid leave entitlements, such as casuals and contractors, may for financial reasons decide to continue working. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have also done is allow people to access their super early. What has been interesting have been the howls of outrage from those on the Left that it is outrageous that this Liberal-National government has allowed workers to access super early. And there have been howls of outrage from Paul Keating, that failed Prime Minister of this country, that Prime Minister who deliberately pushed this country into recession, that Prime Minister who tells the workers of Australia: 'You can't access your own money. I, Paul Keating, know better than you.' This is the arrogance of the Left when it comes to dealing with other people's money. The super contributions that have been put into these super accounts belong to the workers. If people wish to access that, to assist themselves throughout this pandemic, throughout this crisis that is facing Australia, I say they should be allowed to do that. They should be allowed to access their own money to help themselves through this crisis. But oh no—those on the Left don't want that to happen. Those on the Left want the funds to stay in these huge super funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is a fun fact: my understanding is that about $30 billion has been withdrawn from super funds over the last few months, capped out at $10,000 per financial year. That's about the same amount as administration fees that are charged by these super funds! We've got these multibillion-dollar super funds in a trillion-dollar industry. They are in the pockets of big unions, in the pockets of Labor and big business, but it's Labor and the unions who do not want the workers to have access to their own funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is doing everything possible, supporting those who wish to employ people and those who wish to continue employing people and supporting through the JobSeeker supplement those who have found themselves, sadly, without work. But this bill and the amendment as proposed by the Greens will not assist the situation, will not help people as the Greens do think. So the government will not be supporting the amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is welcome to see that employers' ability to bear additional costs during an unprecedented pandemic is acknowledged by the amendment, so they get a tick for that. However, the amendment as proposed by the Greens creates a new obligation on employers and employees. The additional burden of administering payments and seeking reimbursement is not what businesses and individuals need at the moment, particularly those in Victoria but also any around the country that are struggling. It will exacerbate cash flow issues for many businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what it comes down to: on this side of the chamber and in my own party in Queensland we have so many people who come from the business world or who speak to the business world on such a regular basis that we understand the issues that are facing businesses in Australia. As importantly, we understand the issues that are facing workers in Australia and we understand what we need to do to make sure that Australia gets through this pandemic. That's why the government's priority since day one has been about saving lives. It's been about protecting livelihoods. It's been about embarking on a strategy of suppressing coronavirus so that our hospitals can cope with any clusters that may erupt. It is all about making sure that Australia is fighting fit for when we get through this, whether it's at the end of this year or into the New Year, having fought and beaten coronavirus.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I rise to speak in respect of the Fair Work Amendment (COVID-19) Bill 2020 and make the point that Australia needs a universal paid pandemic leave scheme to protect workers, public health and the national economy, and we need it quickly. Labor and the unions have been calling for paid pandemic leave since the start of this health and economic crisis nearly six months ago. It was evident to Labor and the unions from the very beginning that, with one in every three workers in the country not having access to paid sick leave, there could be and is a big problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is the public health risk of people having to choose between forgoing their income and not being able to pay their bills, and turning up to work sick. We know that an estimated 3.7 million Australians don't have any access to paid sick leave or the other protections of permanent employment. These include casuals, contractors, freelancers, sole traders and gig economy workers. Many permanent workers have exhausted their sick leave entitlements already. The obvious risk Labor foresaw from the beginning of this crisis was that, without pandemic leave, many would continue to turn up to work when they were sick or should have been isolating, thereby potentially spreading the virus to their work colleagues and the broader community. But, just as they did with our early calls for a wage subsidy, the government rejected our calls for universal paid pandemic leave for workers, such as casuals, unable to access such arrangements. Despite being warned, the government stubbornly refused even to anticipate the problem, let alone act on the problem, even when it was clear that Labor and the unions had predicted what indeed has happened.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still a very real risk of the second wave extending beyond Victoria, although the good news today, of course, is that the numbers continue to fall in that state and are getting close to 100. Given that what was originally feared has become reality, the government needs to act now and introduce a universal paid pandemic leave scheme to ensure that every Australian worker who needs to stay home knows that they will not be financially penalised for doing so. Not addressing this issue will only lead to the continuation of the community spread of the virus and its devastating impact on our community. Universal paid pandemic leave will help stop the spread of the virus and reduce the chances of a full second wave. If Mr Morrison had listened six months ago, the second wave experienced by Victoria might have been far less severe. Paid pandemic leave is meant to prevent an outbreak. We need a national scheme now to prevent a repeat of the Victorian outbreak in other states. Workers cannot be forced to choose between paying their bills and protecting their colleagues, customers and patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That being said, while Labor support the bill we cannot support the amendments. We take this position on the basis of previous advice that, should this bill pass this house amended in this way, the other house would likely rule it out of order. Labor want the government to introduce universal paid pandemic leave now. We also believe the government should contribute to the cost of such a scheme. We believe payments should be wage-like—that is, paid by the employer as they normally would pay any other kind of leave. Unless we get a universal scheme, we will have more community transmission, leading to more outbreaks and an economy-smashing lockdown. We cannot afford not to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Acting Deputy President, the bill before you isn't perfect—nothing that the Greens ever do is. It isn't necessarily the way Labor would do it. Fourteen days does not properly provide for the circumstances in which a worker may have to isolate several times. Given the economic circumstances in which businesses find themselves, we believe the Commonwealth should contribute to the cost of the paid pandemic leave, but, as we say all too frequently these days, we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (COVID-19) Bill 2020, brought before this chamber by the Greens. As I do, I acknowledge the contribution of the previous speakers and the passion that they have for this issue. Like those of many in this place, through the course of this challenge my office has assisted countless numbers of individuals and organisations who have been hit with the full force of the economic shock from this pandemic—those who, through no fault of their own, found themselves in a tough position; individuals who were suddenly without work and business owners who had tough decisions to make about their future and that of their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place I remarked that I wanted to ensure that all Western Australians had equitable access to our democracy through the course of this challenge, and that is what I've endeavoured to do. I've taken this opportunity to travel around my home state, to find out how this pandemic has impacted people on the ground. Only the week before last, my team and I hopped in the car and embarked on a 6,500 kilometre listening tour from Perth to Western Australia's far north. I've spoken with business owners, not-for-profits, charitable organisations, chambers of commerce and countless individuals, including those in the gig-sharing economies, in some of the most diverse and remote parts of WA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some tough stories from some of the people hit by the full force of this economic shock. There are also some really inspiring stories of ingenuity, reinvention and adaptation. But the message which consistently underpinned each conversation was that the Commonwealth government backed them when they needed it most. JobKeeper was and continues to be a game-changer for so many. It makes sure employees are able to maintain that connection with their employer, something that is an incredibly important factor for those in regional and remote WA, where, if you lose someone, it really is a challenge to rehire for that position. For those not able to get the JobKeeper payment, JobSeeker has been there for them. It's available. This means that people can continue to provide for their families, pay their bills, and prepare to re-enter the workforce, as conditions allow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know many of my colleagues in this place have taken the opportunity to do the same in their own home states. They have listened to the stories and those stories will have helped them inform their position on this issue. I know Senator McGrath did a very similar trip. He spent a lot of time travelling around Queensland speaking to people about these very issues and hearing firsthand accounts of the impact of the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. As a government we continue to provide the required support to Australians as they need it. To reflect the economic challenges, both the JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments will be extended as has been announced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, there is a range of other support measures, such as allowing people to access their own money through their super fund, and the pandemic leave disaster payment for those in Victoria who are unable to earn an income if they must quarantine or self-isolate. The programs the Commonwealth government have put in place are designed to be simple. They are able to be implemented. They are scalable and they are delivered through existing mechanisms. Services Australia is able to have that relationship with so many Australians through their existing systems. This was incredibly important. If we started this process by trying to create our own unique, bespoke implementation, we would probably still be in the process of designing it and there would no doubt be flaws involved. But we used existing systems to ensure that the support got to people where they needed it at the right time. The Australian Taxation Office already has mechanisms in place to deliver payments to businesses. The pandemic leave disaster payment follows a well-established process already in place for the worst natural disasters our nation has faced, like the bushfires and floods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not meet any of these principles. It seeks to work outside of what is achievable and what is workable. As such, the government does not support this bill. Amending the Fair Work Australia Act as proposed will not be effective. We know all too well that the impacts of coronavirus vary widely across borders, regions, sectors, businesses and individuals. That means we need a targeted approach. That is why the pandemic leave disaster payment has been put in place. This payment is available to support all Victorian workers, including casual workers, who are required to self-isolate and quarantine and cannot take personal leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These $1,500 payments could not be any easier to access. They're available through Services Australia by simply picking up the phone and dialling 1802266. Payments can be claimed on multiple occasions as needed. In addition to this, the Prime Minister has written to each of the states and territories offering similar commitments where a jurisdiction declares a state of disaster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens bill, by contrast, doesn't adopt the measured approach commensurate with the need within each jurisdiction. No matter whether an employer operates in Western Australia or in Victoria, the bill will impose significant additional costs on those who are already dealing with the most significant economic impact in generations. The proposal to ask the Fair Work Commission to make COVID-19 leave orders on application will create tremendous complexity and ambiguity for everyone involved as they have to navigate the new application process and understand when an order might apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some businesses and individuals are more exposed to the risk of coronavirus than others and are affected on more occasions than others. The government's payment is available on multiple occasions if a worker needs to self-isolate under a health order or gets sick. But the bill provides only 14 days of leave, which may mean that, in fact, some workers could even miss out. The best the Greens can do—while slamming those of us on this side and while claiming to have a monopoly on compassion—is to come into this place with a bill that might actually provide less support for those who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's contrast this with what the government has already done and made available to other jurisdictions as they need it. Workers with no paid leave entitlements, such as casuals and contractors, may for financial reasons decide to continue working. The federal government's pandemic leave disaster payment provides a lump sum payment to limit the financial hardship for eligible individuals who are directed to self-isolate or quarantine. We put this program in place quickly, in rapid time—record time, possibly. It was announced on 3 August. Services Australia started accepting claims on 5 August, and payments started to flow the following day, on 6 August. Already more than 6,800 claims from residents and nonresidents have been received. Over $8 million has already been paid to those who need it. This is what's possible when you use an established process and the systems that are already in place. If we'd tried to do this through new systems, we'd still be designing them and still be testing them, and, importantly, the impact would not be where it's needed. The support would not be going to where it's needed. We'd still have IT people in back rooms designing a system and robustly testing it, and it would just take forever. We had to use existing systems to make it work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens cannot be trusted with the simplest of ideas. They cannot be trusted with managing a pandemic. They cannot be trusted with informing an economic response. They cannot even be trusted with supporting those who are actually most in need and hit by the worst effects of this economic shock. The government will not be supporting this bill, because we believe that the appropriate measures have been put in place, and they encourage individuals who are in that position of need, who are desperate or who need support that they've got a system that is there to support them and that's responsive, is timely and is right where it's needed. I encourage the chamber to vote against this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250026" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  I'd like to make a short statement about my position on this proposed legislation from the Greens, the Fair Work Amendment (COVID-19) Bill 2020. We can't ask people to take leave if it means that they're going to lose everything. A global pandemic is forcing people to not turn up to shifts. People who want to work aren't able to do it, out of a commitment to public safety. We're asking them to go broke so the rest of us don't get sick. If you've been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and you are required to self-isolate, you're losing money by not turning up for your shifts. If you've got leave saved up, that's what it is there for. What if you don't have any leave? You're on your own. You have to hope you have some savings put away for a rainy day, because I can tell you now that it is pouring and it's not going to stop for two straight weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Amendment (COVID-19) Bill 2020 starts from the same place I do. It is all about helping people who are going broke to keep strangers safe from harm. If you're asked to self-isolate, it's not for your own benefit; it's to keep people safe—people you may never meet but whose lives depend on what you are doing and what decisions you are making. Those who are doing the right thing are going broke for our benefit and to keep us safe. If there's something we can do to help them out, then I want to be able to help them. My problem is that, in order to help them, this bill throws a blank cheque at everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its current form this bill pays too much to the wrong people. We have no idea how much more it's going to cost our grandchildren to repay in the future. There are better ways to stop people from going to work sick. This bill will force the government to cover the cost of a person's wages when they have time off work because of COVID. People who earn more would get more. People with a steady job, annual leave and sick days would actually get more. The Commonwealth would end up paying thousands and thousands of dollars to already well-off people just so they don't have to dip into their leave or sick days when they take time off because of COVID. That doesn't make any sense to me. Why should we pay the wages of a wealthy banker just so they can use their annual leave on a few days at their beach house? Why should we chip in so that a management consultant can still afford to chuck a sickie now and then? Why should we be paying for that? I reckon those people can look after themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PM keeps saying that we're all in this together. The lucky people in Australia who have a steady job right now can afford to do their bit. They're going to have to do some heavy lifting—we all are—because we're going to have to cover the others. They have the choice to do the right thing. They should give up a little on their end when it's good for the community and their country. Sometimes you just have to do that. I know it sucks, but guess what? That's life and that's just how it is right now under the circumstances we're all living in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that scares me about this bill in its current form is that the Greens don't know how much it will cost. They're asking me to sign a blank cheque. I can't do that in good conscience. I will never, ever do that. We could run up some big numbers pretty quickly. In Australia about 12 million people have a job at the moment. It would cost the Commonwealth over $16 billion if half of them took two weeks off at the average wage. There are a lot of people out there who could use that kind of support from the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on JobSeeker are facing a cut to their payments next month. People on JobKeeper will get that too. We're running into the Christmas period. I don't want that to happen. It is not right. Victoria right now is in the middle of the second wave and is still in lockdown. We don't know how long that's going to continue. Why would we cut hundreds of dollars out of JobSeeker when right now some states are in a worse position than they have ever been in? Why would we cut JobKeeper when small businesses are on their knees? Things have changed since the government announced those cuts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a soul in this parliament that thinks we're all going to be hunky-dory four weeks from now. If you do, you are delusional and you probably shouldn't be sitting in parliament. Those support payments have to be extended till after Christmas. We can't be cutting people off from $1,500 a fortnight when everybody is saying that we're yet to break the back of the economic depression we are in. That's where my priorities are right now. That's where we should be spending our money. We shouldn't be paying billions of dollars just to take away the inconvenience of COVID restrictions for people who have a job and earn good money. They're going to have to start doing the heavy lifting. Someone warn them. This is the problem. I don't think we've thought this through enough and I don't think we've weighed the trade-offs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am on board with the idea that casual workers without leave entitlements or a high income need more help. I agree that there should be government support in place for people who could lose their job or have to skip rent payments because they need to self-isolate. That's why I suggested to the Greens that we cap the payments at a sensible level. If you want something done in this place, you've got to compromise. The way I see it, we should set the cap at $1,500 a fortnight—that's the same amount as the current rate of JobKeeper—and maybe we can negotiate with the government at the same time to keep jobseeker and JobKeeper at the rates they are now until after Christmas. Wouldn't that be a better way to do politics in this place? That way, it's a win-win for everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A rate of $1,500 has been broadly accepted as enough to get people through when their income has taken a hit because of this virus. The beauty of it is that people on lower incomes would still get their whole wage. We know they're the ones that will have the most trouble staying home if they're sick because they can't afford to go without a penny. That's where we're at. They would get the help that they need to stop that from happening. People earning more than that could top up their payments with their annual leave, sick leave or savings. Like I said, we're all having to do the heavy lifting—tough, suck it up; these are unprecedented times. It's a much fairer model. It's better targeted to people who need the most help. It also happens to be very similar to the model brought in by the Victorian government at the height of the second wave. It's working there, and it should be expanded to other states before any new outbreaks get out of hand. We need to get one step ahead. We need to start telling people what's coming down if the second or third waves hit, and you should be up to that by now as a coalition. You've now had the second wave in Victoria. There are no excuses anymore for having things in place when outbreaks happen in other states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give money out to the Australians who need it most. I want to stop people from having to choose between going to work sick or paying their rent. I know how hard that choice would be. Unfortunately, this bill in its current form gives more to people who need less help, and it isn't fair or sensible. So I propose a compromise. The Greens don't want to set the rate of COVID leave at any amount. They think it should be whatever you were earning before what you get now. I think it should be set at the rate of JobKeeper for everybody—except those on jobseeker, for obvious reasons. One of the biggest problems is that it's all getting cut off way too soon, and we need to balance fixing that against fixing this. So I've proposed to the Greens an amendment that I think strikes a reasonable balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens don't want it set at JobKeeper, but I don't want it set at an infinite amount where people like Clive Palmer and Twiggy Forrest can be forced to self-isolate—and you think Western Australia is having problems right now—and be given 15 million bucks for the fortnight. Come on! This bill is not being done very well. So let's say that it should be capped at something reasonable, and let's say that that cap should be set by the only ones in this debate able to say what the cost of each level of the cap should be. My proposal is that the government be required to set a cap on the amount a person can receive for COVID paid leave. My amendment doesn't say what the cap should be, it just says, 'You've got to draw the line somewhere, so let's draw a line.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm proposing is fairer, goes further, is more affordable and should be supported by the Senate. If it's more reasonable and supported then maybe you could look at extending jobseeker and JobKeeper at the current arrangement until after Christmas. That would be a win-win for everybody. This is not something that we saw going on when you set that amount two or three months ago when you decided you were going to change it. Things have not got better, and things will not get better tomorrow. We need to think forward, and we need to think on our feet a little bit quicker than what we've been doing.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Ensuring Fair Representation of the Northern Territory) Bill 2020 is a significant private senator's bill for the people of the Northern Territory. I stand here enormously proud to represent the people of the Northern Territory here in the Senate. I stand just as proudly with my fellow Territorians—Luke Gosling, the member for Solomon, and also Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari. I thank very much the CLP senator for the Northern Territory, Sam McMahon, for standing with us in putting this private senator's bill to the Senate for debate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution allows for five members of the House of Representatives for each original state but leaves it to parliament to determine the number of seats in the territories. In some ways, I wish that we didn't have to have this particular bill, but the Australian Electoral Commissioner has declared that the Northern Territory will lose one of its two seats at the next federal election. This news has been met with great despair in the Northern Territory. We have only four voices in a parliament of over 220 parliamentarians. The Northern Territory is growing. The Parliament of Australia says, 'Let's develop the north.' And, when we talk about developing the north and its economy and infrastructure, we must also talk about developing the north in terms of the voices of the people of the north. Removing a voice diminishes all of our voices. I am urging senators to get behind this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 provides for a minimum of one member each for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. A single seat in the House of Representatives would mean one member of parliament representing more than 250,000 Territorians in an electorate of over 1.4 million square kilometres—an electorate which is 30 per cent First Nations people and which has a population undercounted in the census.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I introduce this bill in the Senate along with my Labor colleague—our shadow special minister of state, Don Farrell. It has been co-sponsored by fellow NT Senator, Dr McMahon, and all the Nationals senators. We understand the importance of fair representation for regional, rural and remote Australians and we understand that the Northern Territory has 72 remote Indigenous communities, 500 homelands and 40 Indigenous languages. In fact, there are more than 40. They're the strong ones. There are actually over a hundred Aboriginal languages in the Territory. The case for the two seats in the Northern Territory is about fairness for remote and regional Australians. It recognises the huge geographical area of the Northern Territory, which is six times the size of Victoria and almost double the size of New South Wales. It recognises that, with two seats, the population in each is still not far below the national average and is significantly more than the five seats in Tasmania. This is by no means intended to disrespect my colleagues in all of the other states, but it's important in terms of justice and fairness in terms of democracy. That's what this bill is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which gave us an opportunity to hear from those Territorians who will be affected by this change. The inquiry is considering more than 50 submissions on the issue and has heard from more than 20 witnesses. The overwhelming majority of these support maintaining our two seats in the Northern Territory. They included submissions and evidence from the Chamber of Commerce Northern Territory; the four land councils of the Northern Territory—Central Land Council, Northern Land Council, Anindilyakwa Land Council and the Tiwi Land Council; Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory; Australian Nurses and Midwifery Federation of the Northern Territory; the Chinese Literary Association of Christmas Island; the CPSU; the Multicultural Council of the NT; the Australian Greens; the Leader of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, Lia Finocchiaro; and many more. Greg Ireland, the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, who gave evidence, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… bringing in a floor of two members is what we're seeking. We'd actually love it to be law. But that would at least allow a stronger voice inside parliament to assist with those challenges that we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marion Scrymgour, the CEO of the Northern Land Council, said that returning to a solitary seat would heighten the effective disenfranchisement amongst Aboriginal Territorians. Sarah Cook, from the Isolated Children's Parents' Association, said that a single electorate would 'undoubtedly' limit the representation of remote communities and remote families in federal parliament. Sarah said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lingiari is a massive landmass. There are many, many layers of need and disadvantage. We are already competing for air in those factors. We really think it's unreasonable to further limit us by reducing it to just a single person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sarah Cook gave evidence over the phone from her car in Katherine and told the committee she was about to drive home—10 hours sitting on an open highway.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget the most important Indian Ocean territories that come under the Northern Territory: Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. From Christmas Island, Chris Su wrote that travelling across a single Northern Territory division 'would take more than two weeks and no less than four international airports' and two ferries. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation—based in Maningrida, Arnhem Land, one of the most remote corners of the current electorate of Lingiari—put in a powerful submission. I'd like to read quite a bit from their submission. They say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to share with the Senate the voices of individuals who have spoken to me about this issue and who have signed the Labor petition on this matter. I've spent the past month travelling across vast areas of the Northern Territory. I have been speaking to people from Yirrkala and Baniyala in north-east Arnhem Land and to people from Timber Creek and Yarralin, towards the Western Australian border. I have been speaking to people in Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek. In particular, I have been speaking to people in Kalkarindji, the home of the Gurindji, the site of the 1966 Wave Hill walk-off, which at the weekend marked its 54th anniversary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of you may have seen an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>newspaper last week, a plea from the grandchildren of Vincent Lingiari to the Prime Minister. In a letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison the grandchildren of Vincent Lingiari, Debra Vincent, Sonny Smiler, Rosie Smiler, Jocelyn Victor and Lisa Smiler, called on the Prime Minister to support this bill in the Senate, and in particular when it reaches the House of Representatives, which we seriously hope that it does. They wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2000, we gave permission for the Australian Electoral Commission to use our grandfather's name for the electorate of Lingiari.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important for the Senate to recognise the significance of that letter to the Prime Minister in particular, and the importance, from a cultural perspective, of First Nations people giving permission for a name like Vincent Lingiari to be used in the parliament for a seat in the House of Representatives. The families had no idea what this decision meant in terms of the Australian Electoral Commission. No-one had spoken to them. No-one had explained why the name of Vincent Lingiari may not be going forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my travels I do explain to Territorians what we're fighting for—for fair representation in the Northern Territory, for a voice for remote and regional Territorians, for democracy—and they are absolutely quick to get behind me. I say to the people of the Northern Territory: let's stay strong on this. We deserve to grow in every aspect of that word—grow in the economy, grow in our infrastructure, grow in our population and, most importantly, grow in our democratic rights here in the Australian parliament. </span>

We will continue with that petition. I will table that petition to the Senate later in the year. Petitioners include Erin Lucas from Lajamanu: 'One representative to service the whole of the Northern Territory is unreasonable, unrealistic and, put simply, unfair.' This is what John Boffa from East Side, Alice Springs, and our Chief Medical Officer Public Health at the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress says: 'The population counts are not accurate, and marginalised people need to know their politicians if they are going to be motivated to vote. We must retain two seats.' This is what Raquel Nicholls-Skene in Brinkin says on the petition: 'The Northern Territory has the most disadvantaged people in Australia and being further stripped of representation will only contribute further to their disadvantage. As a territory not a state we already currently miss full participation in our governance—that is, not even a full vote in a referendum.' </span>

It's crucial to the Northern Territory to retain these two seats.' Gregory Thomson from Stuart Park in Darwin said simply, 'One seat is an insult to democracy.' Beverley Genat from Pine Creek said, 'While population density is normally the primary consideration, geographical distance must also be given just and fair consideration.' Werner Appel from Tennant Creek said, 'It's a disgrace.' Ann Grattige in Darwin said, 'It's not all about population size. The complexity of the issues needs to play a part in decision-making.' I would absolutely love to go on, and perhaps I will one day. From interstate we've had Beth Cummings from Millbrook, Western Australia, who said: 'We all need to stick together to do what's best for the Northern Territory.' Barbara Greensmith from Port Pirie in South Australia said: 'NT definitely needs two seats. It's such a huge area and it's totally unacceptable to believe that one person could possibly cover the whole area.' </span>

They understand what federal representation is meant to do and they can't believe the Northern Territory could possibly be represented by one person. They get that a single electorate for the Territory would not give adequate recognition to the differing communities in the NT. They get that a single electorate for the Northern Territory would not recognise the strategic and economic importance of the Northern Territory to Australia as a whole. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor gets it. The Nationals get it. I thank Senator Sam McMahon, Senator Bridget McKenzie, Senator Matt Canavan, Senator Perin Davey and Senator Susan McDonald for co-sponsoring this bill. The Greens get it. Independents Senator Lambie, Senator Patrick and Senator Griff get it. Even the leader of the Northern Territory CLP gets it. So does the Northern Territory Labor Party. With all of these senators supporting the bill, we're hopeful it can pass the Senate. Now I call on the Prime Minister to do the same. The only thing we need now, Prime Minister, is for you to get it, for you to support the voices of the people of the Northern Territory, for you to assist in passing this legislation to enable the Northern Territory to have two seats, at a minimum, in the lower house.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Ensuring Fair Representation of the Northern Territory) Bill 2020. Before I do, I would like to acknowledge the great festival of democracy that was held on the weekend in the Northern Territory. In particular, I want to thank and congratulate all the candidates who stood for election and acknowledge the work of Lia Finocchiaro, the leader of the Country Liberals. I worked for the Country Liberals back in 2012 as their campaign director, when we were very fortunate to come to power after being in the wilderness for a number of years. Lia is one of those brilliant politicians who has what I call the X factor. Congratulations to her and Sallyann Innes and everybody involved in that campaign. I'll have more to say about that at a later time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, introduced by Senators Farrell and McCarthy on 11 June of this year, would amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide for a minimum of two divisions for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives. The introduction of this bill was predicated on research that projected the possibility that the Northern Territory would lose one of its two seats in the House of Representatives, caused by its population falling below the entitlement quota for the second seat. On 12 June of this year, Minister Cormann, as Special Minister of State, wrote to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to ask it to inquire into and report back on this bill early in the spring sittings to ensure a timely deliberation before redistribution processes for the Northern Territory could become too far advanced and that senators hear from appropriate experts and from members of the community, including government agencies, on the administrative and legal implications of this bill. As chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I want to briefly update the Senate on this inquiry and on some of the evidence that has been received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 June, after Minister Cormann's request, the committee resolved to adopt an inquiry into the bill, which was subsequently publicised by media releases and in the form of invitations to interested parties. It was only during the inquiry—this was on 3 July—that the Australian Electoral Commissioner formally made the determination to increase the number of seats in Victoria from 38 to 39, to decrease the number of seats in Western Australia from 16 to 15 and to decrease the number of seats in the Northern Territory from two to one. This was based on the most recent official population figures for the Commonwealth published by the Australian Statistician. What I will do is go into a bit of detail in terms of how this has come about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The population quota for one member is 172,537 people, to be precise, with partial quotas over 0.5 rounded up. Unlike the states, the territories are afforded an additional calculation process to account for the margin of error related to the population at the last census. This margin of error calculation was introduced by the Howard government through the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Act 2004, following the recommendation of JSCEM's 2003 territory representation inquiry. The NT population shortfall for a second member was 11,526. This was more than its population margin of error of 7,440. As such, it did not retain a second seat. The ACT population shortfall for a third member was 1,784. This was less than its population margin of error of 10,694. As such, it retained its third seat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 31 December 2019 estimated resident population data was published by the ABS in June of this year. These were the most recent statistics required to be used by the Electoral Commissioner under the Electoral Act for the calculation of entitlements ahead of the next election. The determination of reduced entitlement for the Northern Territory to one member only applies immediately for the purposes of enrolment. The members elected at the 2019 federal election, representing the division of Lingiari and the division of Solomon, will continue to represent those electorates up until the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part III of the Electoral Act specifies the process to be followed to determine the number of members of each state and territory, when it is to be conducted and by whom it is to be conducted. The number of members in the House of Representatives for a state or a territory is based on the population of that state or territory relative to the population of all other states and territories. Some margin-of-error adjustments are made to the territories to account for the accuracy of their census population data. So enrolment is not relevant to the entitlement to members in the House of Representatives. The allocation of members by jurisdiction involves a calculation that divides the population of the state or territory by a population quota. Partial quotas, as I indicated earlier, over 0.5 from this calculation are rounded up. So, in essence, the population quota equals the number of people of the Commonwealth as ascertained by the Electoral Commissioner, divided by twice the number of senators for states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In calculating this quota, the number of people of the Commonwealth does not include the people of the territories. The Electoral Act requires the Australian Statistician to supply the Electoral Commissioner with the populations of the states and territories, which have been compiled and published in a regular series under the Census and Statistics Act 1905. The information to be supplied by the Statistician is required to be published immediately prior to the day for the calculation—that is, one day after the House of Representatives has been sitting for 12 months following an election. The ABS also publishes the estimated resident population each quarter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Adjustments may be made to the ACT and NT populations as follows: the ACT to include the Jervis Bay territory and to include Norfolk Island where the latter is not entitled to a member in its own right, and the Northern Territory to include the Christmas Island territory and/or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands territory when either or both of these territories are not entitled to a member in their own right. In both of these cases, the population of the smaller territory is added to the population of the ACT or the Northern Territory and the number of members to which the ACT or the Northern Territory is entitled is recalculated. This is an additional calculation which is made where the entitlement for the ACT or the Northern Territory is a whole number and a remainder that is less than or equal to one-half of the population quota. Depending on the outcome of this calculation, a further adjustment may be made to the population and the number of members recalculated. This is the margin-of-error calculation that was introduced in 2004.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 24 of the Constitution does specify that five members at least shall be chosen in each original state and, as has been pointed out by speakers, Tasmania is guaranteed a minimum of five members of the House of Representatives as an original state of the Commonwealth of Australia. Section 122 of the Constitution allows the parliament to make laws for the territories and provides that the parliament may allow the representation of such territories in either house of the parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. Subsection 48(2B) of the Electoral Act requires that at least one member of the House of Representatives shall be chosen in the ACT and the NT at a general election. This provision was introduced through the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act 1989. Prior to the 1989 act, the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation Amendment Act 1983 fixed representation at two members for the ACT and one member for the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that we also look at the historical representation in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory was first represented by one member in the House of Representatives in 1922 through the Northern Territory Representation Act 1922, but it should be noted that the voting and participatory rights of the NT member were initially restricted. They could not vote on any question or be counted in any situation where numbers mattered—for example, a quorum or an absolute majority—and they could not hold office as a Speaker of the House of Representatives or a chair of a House of Representatives committee. In 1936, the Northern Territory member was granted the right to vote on any motion to disallow any Northern Territory ordinance and on any amendment to such a motion. In 1959, the Northern Territory member's right to vote was extended to include any proposal relating solely to the Northern Territory. In 1968, the Northern Territory member was afforded the same rights, privileges and immunities as members for the states. The Northern Territory Representation Act was repealed and replaced by the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation Amendment Act in 1983, which transferred Northern Territory representation privileges in the Electoral Act and retained the Northern Territory's fixed entitlement to one member. I think it's very important to be aware of the historical background of representation in the Northern Territory but also to be fully aware of the legal background upon which redistributions take place in Australia and the basis upon which redistributions do take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the inquiry into this bill was established some months ago, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has received written and verbal evidence from over 50 individuals and organisations. While it was the committee's original hope to travel to the Northern Territory to hold in-person hearings, the committee secretariat received advice that this was probably not appropriate, considering the coronavirus pandemic that is currently sweeping Australia, and so the committee instead agreed to hold a hearing via teleconference on 21 July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the hearing, the committee heard from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and—as Senator McCarthy indicated—we heard from Senator McCarthy along with the federal members for Solomon and Lingiari. We heard from the Australian Electoral Commission. We heard from officers from the Department of Finance and from election analyst Malcolm Mackerras AO—for those who might be listening along at home, it is Professor Mackerras who came up with the Mackerras pendulum. We heard from the ABC's Antony Green as well as from a number of other representatives including from the Chamber of Commerce NT, the Isolated Children's Parents' Association and Indigenous organisations, and from other individuals. Some were supportive of the bill. Others called for amendments or changes to the formula. In saying so, responses to questions on notice arising from the hearing were due last week, and there are some submissions that the committee still needs to consider before publication. It is my understanding that the committee secretariat now is working through the evidence that we have received. The committee had agreed to consider the report in early October; however, it is my preference—and I'm looking across at my Labor colleagues over there—that, subject to the view of other committee members, and without wishing to step on their toes, and considering the workload of the secretariat, I would hope that we can report back sooner than that, given the formal determination by the Australian Electoral Commission in July.</span>

I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land that I am dialling in from here in Meanjin, or Brisbane, the Turrbal, the Yuggera and the Yugarabul people, and that sovereignty was never ceded, so we are on stolen land. I'm very proud to be first senator using our remote facilities, as the chamber finally enters the 21st century. I hope that we can continue that trend to modernity with, maybe, some more women in cabinet and a more representative chamber, and that is, of course, what the bill is about today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Ensuring Fair Representation of the Northern Territory) Bill 2020 is a bill that the Greens are very proud to support, and it goes to the ability of this chamber to represent its constituents and to the ability of the House to represent its constituents. The reason for this bill is that in early July the Electoral Commissioner determined that population changes in the Northern Territory meant that the electoral entitlement for the NT was for one lower house seat only. If the parliament doesn't act, then this small change in relative population will lead to the Northern Territory losing half of its representation in the House and going from four federal representatives down to just three. The resulting lower house electorate would cover the entire Northern Territory and the Christmas and Cocos Islands, so it would be by far the largest electorate in the country by population, at almost a quarter of a million people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens strongly believe that halving the number of seats in the Territory would be a massive injustice for First Nations people living in the Territory—who are, frankly, already unrepresented and underserved by our parliamentary system. It would also lead to major underrepresentation for rural and remote communities across the Territory and the islands. These diverse and disparate communities already share one rural electorate, despite the diversity of issues that the electorate has to cover. To combine an already stretched electorate with an urban centre would just further marginalise rural and remote issues. That is, of course, the reason why we are in strong support of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the bill there was broad consensus expressed, both by those making submissions and those giving evidence, that returning to just one member and one electorate would seriously diminish the representation of people in the Northern Territory. I note that the Territory is 27 per cent First Nations people, which is the highest proportion of any state or territory. Lingiari, which is the seat that would be abolished, has the highest proportion of First Nations voters, at about 40 per cent, so its amalgamation would seriously and disproportionately impact the representation that First Nations people are able to get in the House of Representatives chamber in this federal parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already mentioned how the NT is huge in its geography and covers a disparate range of constituencies. Currently, the urban and industrial issues are concentrated around Darwin, in the seat called Solomon, while most regional areas are represented in Lingiari. As I've said, amalgamation of those into one seat, we fear, would give priority to those urban areas over regional, remote and First Nations issues and voices. In relation to fracking, for example, which is, of course, quite topical, city voters who might have bought the spin that somehow there'll be some economic benefits flowing from gas—which, frankly, is dubious and disputed by the experts—might vote differently to people in the regional and remote areas, who will have to live with the impacts of a destroyed water table and other incursions onto their land. So it will be very difficult for a representative to balance those competing interests and concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, in order to represent an electorate properly you should get around and visit the place. Part of the reason I'm dialling in remotely is so that I can do that in the 14 days after this fortnight of sittings, rather than being in an appropriate level of quarantine to keep my fellow Queenslanders safe. But, because of the size of the NT, making it one seat makes it thoroughly impractical for the representative to get around and actually listen to the community and then represent those interests here in parliament. I want to note that in federal voting statistics the Northern Territory already has a lower turnout than other states and territories. If voters already feel unrepresented due to the size of the existing electorates and, further, the lack of an elected representative to get around and see them personally, there's potential for even less engagement and even more disenfranchisement. That would be a tragedy for our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the NT population fluctuates with a clear margin of error and that the census data is sometimes unreliable given the transient nature of the population means that it's preferable to have a guarantee of two seats, rather than changing between one and two seats every few terms. There is a whole range of ways this could be achieved, and some of the submitters to the inquiry on the bill went through them. Antony Green proposes a harmonic mean apportionment. It all gets very 'wonky' and interesting. We're very open to considering those methods in the future, but for now we think this bill is a necessary safeguard to protect our democracy and protect the interests of First Nations people through their being properly represented in the House of Representatives and the federal parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is a crucial time in our relationship with First Nations people. The Greens, of course, believe that we need a treaty, we need truth, we need justice, we need healing, we need reparations and we need sovereignty acknowledged. All of those issues should be dealt with by this parliament and by our community, but, if we are to start off by reducing representation of First Nations people in federal parliament, that sends absolutely the wrong message and could set back progress on those other crucial issues of how we respect and acknowledge our First Nations people and their rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're on electoral reform, I have said that this bill is important, and the time for dealing with these issues is now, but there are also a lot of other reforms that our democracy is crying out for. We need more diversity of representation in our chamber and we need the voices of the community to be properly represented. Now, I have a private member's bill of my own, which will, hopefully, come on for debate at some point this century, which would remove the influence of private money on our democracy. It would say that, actually, you shouldn't be able to buy influence and that particular industries should not be able to make massive donations that then buy tacit favours or tacit policy outcomes that suit the bottom line while community interests, the public interest and the interests of the planet get put second, third or last. We think that's a crucial electoral reform as well. It has long been the Greens' view that we should get dirty donations and their influence on our democracy right out of the picture, so I'll be hoping to bring that bill on at some point. It would cap donations from everybody at $1,000 a year. That's for individuals; that's for community groups. That's for everybody, because we don't think that big money should be running our democracy; we think it should be about the public interest and the interests of the planet and the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is, of course, the biggest electoral reform that the Greens will continue to champion and to push for, and we hope to have some support for that, but we note that, sadly, both of the big parties do accept very large corporate donations—to the tune of, I think, $100 million now since 2012. So, sadly, we're not yet confident that that bill will have the numbers it requires to pass, but we live in hope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of other reforms that are needed for our democracy to remain in this century, remote participation is, of course, at the top of the list. I'm really pleased that we are here and that things seem to be working. I haven't had my phone buzz, Mr President, to say that you can't hear me or see me or that things aren't working, so I assume that all is tickety-boo. I'm very grateful for that, but it's six months too late. We've been in this global pandemic for six months now and, really, we should've seen this process expedited at the beginning of that time. I'm glad we're here now, but it did take an awfully long time. Let's hope that the system holds up for the coming fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of other reforms, the parliamentary code of conduct and, of course, a federal corruption watchdog, which go hand in hand, are desperately needed. I'll be speaking about the parliamentary code of conduct later today because the reporting to the inquiry into my bill to set one up is being tabled this afternoon, but suffice to say I think we need to make the parliament a more attractive workplace so that people actually want to enter politics and seek to make change, improve people's lives and work for the betterment of us all. The way that they see many senators and members conducting themselves really doesn't endear the profession to people who might be interested in a career in politics. If we're talking about democratic reforms and making our chamber more representative, then things like parliamentary standards so that conflicts of interests are properly managed and people act in the public interest are really very basic stuff that should have been legislated an awfully long time ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of other democratic reforms, ensuring government decision-making and advisory bodies have broader representation is very crucial and very topical. We've seen the COVID commission stacked with industry representatives who have vested interests in pushing particular industries or particular resources, even particular projects, and there are very lax conflict-of-interest rules about how to manage those flagrant conflicts between what could be advocacy for the public interest through a public commission and what could be advocacy for the private interests of the personnel who are on that commission. Again, in this broader context of making our democracy work better, it's the community that needs to be represented, not people's private interests, so making sure that those government decision-making or advisory bodies are more representative and have better conflict-of-interest rules is well overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole lot of other initiatives that we would love to see trialled as we take these tentative steps towards the 21st century in our teenage democracy. Things like citizen-initiated matters of public importance, citizens' assemblies and participatory budget-making—actually involving people in their democracy more systemically and more successfully—would lead to better outcomes. We would all be better informed and the system would do its job better. So we're really excited about the prospect of progress on those issues. We've learnt to become very patient, so I am not sure how long it will be until we see some real action on those things, but I am proud to be in a party that's pushing those issues and I know that there are many people in the chamber that agree on these issues, so there's hope for reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the reasons we support broader democratic reform, and in this particular instance we support this bill. I want to pay tribute and credit to Senator McCarthy, who has really championed this issue and has done, as always, an excellent job on it. I acknowledge that this legislation would entrench malapportionment, but we think it's fair enough in this case. You can't have a single Representatives seat representing an entire territory that is 27 per cent First Nations people and say that that's good and fair representation because there has been a slight change in population numbers. That could potentially lead to a really unfair and, I think, undemocratic outcome. So we need this fixed. We've got the bill before us today to fix it. I don't think it's coming on for a vote. I hope I'm wrong about that. We will certainly be supporting the bill if it does, and I do hope that the government take this on board and take the strong feedback of all of the submitters on board along with the rights, wishes and desires of First Nations communities to be properly represented in this chamber and in the other chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I conclude my remarks. It seems the tech has held up, so I'm grateful for that. I say thank you to everyone who has been involved in getting these remote facilities set up. There have been a lot of people working very long hours. We're very grateful for that and we thank you for it.</span>

At the outset I will follow the lead of Senator McGrath in congratulating the Leader of the Opposition for last weekend's election in the Northern Territory. I extend my congratulations to the Chief Minister, Mr Gunner, who we hope has, in the most difficult of circumstances, been returned to majority government. I can see Senator Smith nodding there. I had the great privilege of working with Mr Gunner in the 1990s when he was an official of the shop assistants union—that great union—and it does appear that at some time either today or tomorrow, when the counting is completed, we will find that he has been returned with a majority government in the Northern Territory and will continue the terrific work that he's been doing, particularly in the circumstances of the pandemic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am a co-sponsor of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Ensuring Fair Representation of the Northern Territory) Bill 2020 and support very much the legislation in terms of its extension to the Northern Territory or maintenance of the current position. I note that one of the people who made a very clear submission to the inquiry into this bill was, in fact, the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, who made it very clear that she would like to see the continuation of two seats for the Northern Territory. I am aware that there are other people who would like to speak on this topic who are from the Northern Territory, so I am happy to associate myself with the remarks of Senator McCarthy and complete my comments at this point.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I rise today, strongly on behalf of Territorians, in my support of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Ensuring Fair Representation of the Northern Territory) Bill 2020. I'm not surprised, reading through the submissions to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into this bill, at the vocal opposition to the Australian Electoral Commission's move to reduce the number of the Territory's lower house seats from two to one. Given the strong opposition from community groups, Indigenous land councils, political analysts such as Antony Green, professors, the Northern Territory government, Territory opposition, federal members and senators in this place, I have to wonder why we allow a blunt mathematical equation on population to get it so wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads me to the purpose of this bill. Through this bill we are seeking to ensure a minimum of two seats for the Northern Territory. Let's not forget that as a Territory we have only two senators; that's four representatives in total, and it's proposed to go down to three. Since 2001 Territorians have been served by two members of parliament. Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data, overlaid by an arbitrary Australian Electoral Commission formula, the Territory is set to lose a seat. This would mean 250,000 Territorians would be represented by just one member of parliament—and, I might add, that doesn't include unenrolled voters. At 31 March, the Northern Territory government believed there were approximately 24,000 unenrolled voters in the Territory. Many of the Territory's unenrolled voters are Indigenous. I myself, having just been through some of the gruelling remote-area mobile polling, have seen firsthand how many people in remote communities are not enrolled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without this bill, the Territory would become the largest seat in the country, seeing an extra 30,000 people spread over an area more than 35,000 times as large as the electorate of Melbourne, while, on the other hand, we have Tasmania. I love my Tasmanian colleagues. But Tasmania is, as we've heard, guaranteed five seats, regardless of its population—five members in the House of Representatives, with a population of about 535,000 people. And let's not forget: Tassie gets 12 senators. So, for double our population, Tasmania has over four times our representation. Without this bill, Tassie would have over five times our representation. It doesn't sound fair, and it's not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But leaving fairness out of it for a second, if it is deemed that an MP can adequately represent a certain population, then why doesn't that apply in the NT? As Territorians, we like to think we're different. But are we? It is an area of approximately 1.4 million square kilometres, has a population of approximately 250,000 and has a population density of approximately 1.75 people per 100 square kilometres—fewer than two people per 100 square kilometres. It's currently the second-largest division in Australia, behind Durack in WA—but let's not forget, WA has many more MPs, and 12 senators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have cosmopolitan Darwin and Palmerston, covered by the seat of Solomon. The rest of the NT is covered by the seat of Lingiari. This contains the towns of Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs, Timber Creek, Pine Creek and so on. We also have reasonably large-sized towns that are incredibly isolated, such as Groote Eylandt, sitting in the gulf, and Gove, up on the tip of Arnhem Land, that is inaccessible by road for much of the year. We also have some of the most remote communities in Australia. Lingara is out in the Victoria River district, out towards Halls Creek in WA. I was there just last week. It's an eight-hour, one-way trip to get to Darwin. Lingara had three voters last week, but those three people deserve representation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget the NT also includes Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands out in the Indian Ocean. You cannot even fly there from Darwin. You have to go via Perth or Malaysia. There are 2,000 people out in those territories. It takes an entire week to do a trip out there. Imagine that you have to travel to another state or overseas to visit your constituents. It's unimaginable for the rest of Australia. The Territory is six times the size of Victoria and almost double the size of New South Wales. Not only that, as we've heard, the Territory is home to a culturally rich and diverse population, with 27 per cent of Australia's Indigenous population calling the Territory home. Roughly 40 per cent of the population of Lingiari is Indigenous. Most of these remote communities which contain our Indigenous population are only accessible by unsealed roads and are impassable during the Territory's wet season. It makes the work of scheduling for a Territorian MP very challenging. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July, our government reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people overcome entrenched inequality through the national agreement and set 16 new targets across key challenges, including health, education, employment, justice and housing. At a time when we are seeking to elevate the voice of our First Nations people to address these issues, our Indigenous Territorians deserve effective and efficient representation, and this is best served by ensuring at least two MPs in the Territory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The seat of Solomon focuses on the Darwin-Palmerston areas. In that seat is Darwin Port, the closest port to South-East Asia. The port is vitally important, not only to Australia's defence capabilities but for trade relationships with the rest of the world. The seat also contains major defence assets and is home to the US Marine Rotational Force. Tourism, education and manufacturing are other important activities for this hub. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, these two seats have very unique characteristics, opportunities and challenges, but both share in the challenge of the tyranny of distance. Without this bill, there is no doubt the Territory's strategic and economic importance will be undermined. Now, more than ever, in the light of COVID, this is not in Territorians' best interests, and it's certainly not in our nation's best interests. COVID has seen a number of the Territory's key industries and businesses put at risk. The timing couldn't be worse, with an NT Labor government debt forecast to be $8.2 billion. The ramifications of this will see many Territorians seeking access to their local MP, whether that is to help locate opportunities for community funding grants, provide assistance to small business in accessing small business loans, or to help constituents deal with human services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the challenges, we also need to be looking for the projects capable of ensuring economic recovery. In the Territory, we are blessed with many opportunities. Some of those opportunities are in tourism, mining, gas, minerals, manufacturing and education. MPs are often the first go-to on these project proposals, and ensuring that they are briefed helps them advocate successfully in Canberra. With just one MP—an MP who would undoubtedly spend more time travelling than meeting with Territory constituents—my fear is that the Territory's potential may never be realised and our people, particularly Indigenous Territorians, will continue to be left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to particularly thank my co-sponsor, Senator McCarthy, for her strong advocacy on behalf of all Territorians and the contribution we make to this nation. I implore all of my colleagues to consider the role our MPs have in representing in Canberra each and every part of their electorates, and to ask themselves: is it fair to give 250,000 culturally, economically, and geographically diverse Territorians just one MP? I hope the answer to that question is an unequivocal no.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  Today I rise to support the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Ensuring Fair Representation of the Northern Territory) Bill 2020 in the strongest possible terms. 'One vote, one value' is an important principle in our democracy, and we know that periodic electoral redistributions take place to make sure that this principle is maintained. But it is not the only principle that is important in Australian democracy. Indeed, given its growing population, should the current electoral redistribution go ahead in the Northern Territory, the very principle of 'one vote, one value' would be undermined because of the extraordinary number of people who would end up in the one and only Northern Territory lower house electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Constitution enshrines a minimum level of representation for each of our states in the House of Representatives. The low population of a state may fall, but the number of seats in that state can never fall below five. Our founders knew that states have distinct interests and that those states must be represented not only in the Senate but also in the House of Representatives. Indeed, the point that has just been made is that states' interests are well served not only by the minimum of five lower house seats but also by the fact that there are 12 senators for each state—a luxury that the Northern Territory does not enjoy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other principles that the Australian Electoral Commission applies when redrawing electoral boundaries, and they include community interests within electorates. That's an important principle as well. Our democracy recognises that people cast their votes according to what is important to them and their community, and the Electoral Commission recognises, and our Commonwealth Electoral Act is designed to recognise, that this can differ extremely widely between the city and the bush, between one part of the city and another, and between communities built around manufacturing or around a service sector or agriculture. Democracy is how we negotiate all of those different values and different interests. For that to work, they have to be represented in both houses of our parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these important parts of making our democracy work will be disregarded if the Northern Territory has only one electorate. One single parliamentarian will represent nearly 250,000 Australians. It will be, by far, the largest electorate in Australia. On the figures for the redistribution from last year, the Northern Territory falls short of two seats by fewer than 5,000 people. If the Territory retains two seats, each of them will have more electors than any of the five seats in Tasmania. What's more, the Northern Territory's Department of Treasury and Finance predicts that, by next year, the Northern Territory's population will be more than 251,000 people. By the time the election is held, it will have even on the single criterion of population more than enough people to deserve two seats. If the Northern Territory loses a seat then in that election one Northern Territory vote will have one-half value. That is an extraordinary way for the current Electoral Act to override the principle of one-vote one-value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in our nation we must look to the principles of democracy. Those future figures and the figures now are not even taking into account the significant barriers to enrolment in remote Indigenous communities. I myself know from experience in the Kimberley that there are many more eligible voters in many places around the country than are on the electoral roll. The Commonwealth government doesn't do nearly enough work in the remote communities of our country to get voters on the roll. This government makes it difficult for people who don't have ID and who move frequently to stay on the roll. This has a disproportionate effect on Australia's remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's certainly well within the bounds of possibility that, if enrolment in remote areas matched the national average, the Northern Territory would be entitled to two seats right now. While I note that it is based on population, we need also to look very clearly at the enrolment levels of those communities. The representation of distinct interests of each jurisdiction that makes up our federation is clearly being overridden by reducing the Northern Territory to one seat, and that must be prevented. Other senators have made remarks about the huge distances that are covered in seats like Durack. Indeed, the Northern Territory would have the largest seat in our federation. It is absolutely extraordinary that this seat be taken from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the guarantee of a minimum number of seats for each state regardless of population because I absolutely agree that properly representing a state's common interests in parliament and caucuses needs a baseline number of members. Our democracy currently does not extend that same principle to our territories. It absolutely should. One of the reasons it absolutely must in the case of the Northern Territory is that it is by far a very distinct electorate and territory compared to the rest of our nation, which has large numbers of suburban seats. Representation of each state is made up of large numbers of suburban seats, whereas the Northern Territory essentially has a remote seat and a city seat. Here we're expecting even them to be rolled together. We cannot countenance the idea of the Northern Territory and all those remote voters being bundled together with a city seat when their voices are so incredibly distinct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In what fundamental way is the Northern Territory different to a state besides the administrative and legal accidents of history—or perhaps should I say the racist accidents of history? The Northern Territory was not historically treated as a state, because of its low population size at a time when its population was not even counted. That was when the accidents of history actually occurred. The Northern Territory became a territory at a time when the Australian human population of the Northern Territory were not properly counted even as citizens. They may not even have been counted in a population census at the time these administrative decisions were made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were forming the Australian federation today, wouldn't the chief ministers of the territories be at the table with the premiers of the states? When our nation mobilised to combat COVID-19—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  Labor does not oppose the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. The bill amends the governance structures of the Australian Skills Quality Authority, the national VET sector regulator, and enhances information-sharing arrangements between ASQA and the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. Key amendments in this legislation before the chamber today revise ASQA's governance structure, replacing the existing chief commissioner/chief executive officer and two commissioners with a single independent statutory office holder, in this case a CEO. It establishes the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council. The advisory council is intended to provide ASQA with access to expert advice regarding the functions of the regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, in Labor, we know the value of TAFE and of union representation. Their views need to be heard and considered when it comes to our vocational education and training sector. That's why today in the Senate we'll seek to move amendments to ensure the public provider has seats at the table. We support a fair and considered approach to these reforms and we support changes that improve ASQA's capacity to ensure responsiveness to students, communities and employers, but we'll reject changes that attempt to weaken ASQA's regulatory framework. We in this chamber need to ensure that the reforms to ASQA audit processes don't allow any drop in quality. In the past, we have seen this government be slow to act on quality issues. In Labor's view, this has done serious damage to the sector. There is considerable need for reform. But, more broadly, in the case of reform, the bill before us today is just another tweak from a third-term government that has refused to deliver genuine reform that overhauls our vocational training sector. Today the bill before us does not come close to fixing the mess that the Liberal government has made of Australia's TAFE and training system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our nation we have, very clearly, a skills shortage which existed before COVID-19 hit. The coronavirus outbreak has highlighted that more than seven years of Liberal government has left Australia facing a crisis in skills and in vocational training. The most recent figures show a 73 per cent drop in the number of apprenticeships advertised. Indeed, I have spoken to small businesses that say they've been struggling to keep their apprentices on. This government did offer a subsidy for apprentices. That's a step in the right direction, but this is a critical problem for our nation. Much more needs to be done in offering support to newly starting apprentices and trainees. If we as a nation fail on that score, we will have a much deeper and greater skills shortage in the years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a skills shortage before COVID-19 hit. The government spent seven years neglecting our TAFE and training systems. It has spent seven years ignoring the vital role that TAFE plays in the growth of our young people and the vital role it plays in the growth of our economy. We have had seven years of cutting funding from the sector while there has also been underspending in the meagre amount that the government promised to the vocational education and training sector. So rebuilding our skills and training sector will be crucial and critical to getting our economy going again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely need to be properly funding our TAFE and apprenticeship programs. We've seen $3 billion worth of cuts in recent years to TAFE and to training. This government must restore the funding that they've cut. The government must invest in training the next generation of tradespeople in their areas, and we need them to take some responsibility in doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a litany of skills and vocational training failures under this government. More than seven years of Liberal government has left Australia facing a crisis in skills and vocational training. As we learned last year from the federal education department's own data, the Liberals have failed to spend $919 million of their own TAFE and training budget over the last five years. All this money is sitting in the government's bank account—all in addition to the more than $3 billion already ripped out of our system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have TAFE campuses falling apart in our country. We've got state governments closing campuses and ending courses. All the while, money remains unspent. Why? Because the government says that there's been less demand than forecast. The Liberal Party has said this every year since it came to office. I'm sorry to say that this simply does not stack up when underemployment is at near record levels at the same time as employers in our country are crying out for skilled workers. What's the result of this underspend? There are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees and there's a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our country, the number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. The Independent National Centre for Vocational Education Research recently found that, over the past year, 20 per cent fewer people were signing up to trade apprenticeships and traineeships. This was even more extreme in a number of very essential trades. The number of Australians starting an apprenticeship or traineeship in construction—including carpentry, bricklaying and plumbing—has dropped by an alarming 40 per cent. In some areas, there are more people dropping out of vocational courses than there are finishing them. This doesn't happen by accident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a $1 billion underspend from this Liberal government. That funding included incentives for business to take on apprentices and support to help people finish their apprenticeships, and there was a fund designed to train Australians in areas of need. The government's proposals to support education and training in our country are simply not working. This brings us to a skills crisis in an era of rising youth unemployment. We have, simultaneously, a crisis of youth unemployment and a crisis of skills shortages. One of these is bad enough, but to be faced with both at the same time is hard to imagine, particularly at this time. But here we are confronted with both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been nearly a 10 per cent increase in the number of occupations facing skills shortages, while the Australian Industry Group says that 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find the qualified workers they need. There are almost two million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed. We see businesses struggling to fill the skilled positions they have on offer. At the same time, we have young people desperate for work who can't fill those positions because they haven't been given the chance to gain the skills that those roles require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why isn't the Morrison government training these people for jobs in industries where there's a shortage of workers. Why? Because this Liberal government has cut funding to TAFEs and training. And, even though this is the case, and it's plainly obvious that it is, the government still refuses to properly fund the sector. It refuses to give it the proper reform that it so desperately needs. Young people in our country have been very clear about what they need. They need a skills and training sector that is properly funded. They need that sector to be properly resourced. They need it to have educators who are properly trained and able to skill-up young people as a pathway to meaningful employment. This nation needs that now more than ever. This government has not delivered on a single one of those requests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Liberal government that has no plan to fix our nation's skills crisis. It doesn't care enough or have the capacity to do the hard work that needs to be done to build a better post-school education system. Our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has no plan to fix the skills crisis he has created. He has no plan to create more jobs for those who are unemployed. He has no plan to lift wages for those who are employed. As always, this Prime Minister would rather hide from problems than do the hard work that is needed to fix and resolve them. We have from our Prime Minister spin and deflection, bringing in marketing teams and celebrity ambassadors to distract from the real issues that confront our nation on skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in JobMaker another marketing slogan with no substance. JobTrainer goes nowhere near replacing the funding the government has stripped out and we still don't know what it will do. A government that is fiddling at the edges of our current system will not address the profound problems that undermine vocational education and training and consequently the productive performance and international competitiveness of our economy. Unlike Labor, this government does not understand the critical role of TAFE as a public provider, the value in skills and apprenticeships or the real value of the hardworking and passionate public providers in TAFE, our TAFE teachers. If we continue down this path we, as a nation, will be severely jeopardising our future, including our future economic growth. We will also undermine the opportunity of individual Australians to meet their full potential and, most importantly, compromise our ability as a nation to compete with the rest of the world, using the skills, knowledge, discovery and invention of our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that nine out of 10 jobs created in the future will need a post-secondary school education, at either TAFE or university. So we need to increase participation in both our universities and our vocational education sector. We need to make sure our young people are prepared for the world of work—a world of work that we have all seen recently changing so very quickly. If we do not value the role of an appropriately funded VET sector for the training, skills and apprenticeships it provides so many Australians, its vital role in driving the economy and enhancing industries will be overlooked. This is a third-term government that simply refuses to deliver genuine reform that overhauls the higher education sector and that properly funds both vocational training providers and our nation's universities to deliver the services that their students need.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. The bill makes substantial changes to the Australian Skills Quality Authority's governance structure, establishes the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council and revises arrangements for data sharing and access pertaining to the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. The Greens will not oppose this bill, but we are not without concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any regulator should be empowered and resourced to do its job without interference from the government. As I've said before in this chamber, ASQA's ability to operate effectively relies on having the resources that it needs and on having strong independence. The bill before us, like past changes to vocational education and training regulation, is concerning in that it expands the scope of directions that the minister can give ASQA. We must not open the door to the kind of ministerial interference we saw in Minister Birmingham's Australian Research Council meddling with recommendations or the Prime Minister and former Minister McKenzie's rorting of sports grants. This bill also continues the government's disquieting pattern of avoiding appropriate scrutiny of executive decisions in this chamber by adding to the number of non-disallowable legislative instruments under the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is from a government that is allergic to scrutiny, with a history of mismanagement of vocational education and training and utter disrespect for the public training system it's worked systematically to undermine. Any such move is alarming. We'll be watching closely how these changes play out over the next few months as the government pursues its purported skills reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of an advisory council in this bill is welcome, although it is unsurprising from the Liberals that the sensible thing hasn't been done upfront by making sure the voices of our public training providers and our trade unions are included in the council, so we will join our Labor colleagues in supporting an amendment to that end. I urge my crossbench colleagues to support us in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was extraordinary, I must say, to watch a Liberal prime minister attack the very vocational education and training system that they created. They created the system by destroying TAFEs and public training in Australia with the help of the Prime Minister's state Liberal colleagues. And yet the Prime Minister offered no new funding at the Press Club earlier this year. There were more than 4,000 words and not one single mention of TAFE, the bedrock of our training system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need free TAFE and uni for all and new investment to rebuild publicly delivered training in our TAFEs. Those would be the crucial first steps of any skills overhaul. Instead, all we got from the Prime Minister was hot air, a push to renegotiate funding without offering a single extra cent to the system he is underfunding and all the language of competition and marketisation that will rightly send a shiver down the spine of Australians, who know public education and training are the closest thing we have to a ticket to a more fair, equal and just society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that language again from the Productivity Commission's interim report, which urges more of the same marketisation that has led the VET system into disarray and scandal, while suggesting that little priority to TAFEs be given and that state funding should be unwound. What's more, the total of government loans repaid to students who have been ripped off by shonky for-profit VET providers has now surged past $1.2 billion, but the government is once again entertaining extending loan programs to private providers—the same kind of extension that got us in this mess in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of TAFE and the risk we run in neglecting it cannot be overstated. A report from The Australia Institute released on National TAFE Day this year tells us the system creates $90 billion in economic benefits annually and well-funded TAFE is essential for delivering the workforce needed for post-COVID reconstruction. Altogether, the benefits that come from TAFE are 16 times more than the investment. How amazing is an investment that gives you 16 times more than you put in? That's our TAFEs and that's why we must support them. These are enormous benefits for Australia, yet, as the author of the report, Alison Pennington, puts it, that house is now crumbling from neglect and policy vandalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also finds that the TAFE system increases employability and lowers unemployment. TAFE graduates enter the labour force with better employment prospects and skills. The increased labour force participation and employability of TAFE graduates correspond to additional employment of 486,000. The report finds that the TAFE system promotes wider social benefits critical to addressing inequality. TAFE helps bridge access to further education and job pathways in regional areas and for special and at-risk youth groups. TAFE students are more likely to come from low-income households and identify as Aboriginal, compared with students of private vocational education and training providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lesson we should have learned once and for all in the debacle of the Labor-Liberal VET loans program is that, as with all stages of education, in vocational education and training there is no place for private profit. For the future of young people seeking training—indeed for the future of our country—we need to understand that their skills should not be the domain of profiteers seeking to juice what they can from the taxpayer while meeting their minimum obligation to students and then banking the difference for their profits. Time and again we've seen the exploitation resulting from that business model. Nearly 40 per cent of young people don't have a job or enough hours of work. Youth wage growth is the flattest it has ever been. Those figures are only going to worsen, and enrolments in education and training are going to skyrocket as the economy continues to deteriorate. If we are to help them and if we are to build a more socially and economically just society after the pandemic, we need massive investment in a Green New Deal, including making TAFE and uni free and providing significant new government investment to make sure that we don't leave whole generations behind.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I too rise to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. Australia's skills and education system has always been a very strong passion of mine. I've spent my working life getting people into work, and having the right skills and training packages, which respond to industry needs, is a critical enabler of that. I've seen the life-changing impact that this government's focus on skills and training continues to have, and I'm proud to stand here on this side of the chamber to speak on this bill, which is another demonstration of how important this issue is to our economic agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Skills, education and training have never been more important to our nation than right now in the recovery phase of this challenge. Our national economy and the businesses within it will continue to see significant upheaval. I don't believe there has been another point in our recent history when the labour market in Australia has experienced such a high level of fluidity. The ability of our skills and training system to adapt to this environment so as to respond to the rapidly changing needs of industry will be critically important as we recover, and this bill goes some way to addressing that. It is a critical piece of our economic response to this coronavirus challenge. We know that skills and training will be crucial to Australia's economic recovery. That is why VET reform is a key pillar of the Morrison government's JobMaker plan. We know we need to move quickly to position the VET sector to support Australia's economic recovery. The jobs created as we come out of this crisis will not be the same as the jobs that were lost, and it's critical that Australians can access high-quality and relevant training to reskill and upskill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Government and Other Matters) Bill amends the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 to reform the governance structure of the Australian Skills Quality Authority. The main function of the bill will be to replace the current governance structure of a chief commissioner and deputy commissioners with a CEO and advisory council. This will modernise the regulator so that it can take on a greater educative role and have a more effective regulatory approach. This bill also enables ASQA to engage external help as required and ramp up information-sharing, among other reforms. This means the organisation will be more adaptive and responsive to the needs of industry and the demands of the broader Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of our recovery plan, the government have announced we will partner with state and territories to establish a $1 billion JobTrainer fund. This fund will rapidly provide around 340,700 additional training places that are free or low-fee in areas of identified skills need for jobseekers and school leavers. We must always ensure that any funding is directed to training for jobs that exist or for jobs that are in need, and that's what this package is designed to do. We're not interested in just funding training for training's sake. We're not going to fund underwater origami courses—courses that won't actually lead someone to a job; we're going to fund training that matches the needs of industry and matches the needs of employers. Senator Faruqi said the Greens have a great opposition to funding private training providers. Well, I've just been through the Pilbara, and I've met businesses that are providing their own training. And guess what? Those businesses are the best people to train people for their jobs, and we should be doing everything we can to support that, not just have the government provide the training. When the industry know what they want and industry know what they need—that is something that I'm always going to support because we know that it yields even better results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To access the JobTrainer funding, states and territories need to sign the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform, which sets out immediate reforms to improve the vocational education and training sector and provides the foundation for long-term improvements. I understand that there are discussions going on right now with the Western Australian government and, while I'm not privy to those discussions, I know that my home state in particular is experiencing a lot of churn in critical sectors, some of which power the national economy. I hope that they are able to conclude those negotiations very soon so that we can get on with the task of providing necessary training to meet the needs of the jobs that are ahead of us. The priorities in the heads of agreement are all aimed at ensuring that the VET system is delivering for students and employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, we've announced the $2.8 billion Supporting Apprentices and Trainees measure, which commenced on 2 April 2020. The most recent figures demonstrate the government has provided over $462 million to support over 50,000 businesses employing more than 87,000 apprentices and trainees. This has been a game changer for the apprentices and the businesses which employ them. For us there was no other option. It is absolutely critical to the success of our nation coming out of this pandemic that those who are completing their apprenticeship are able to continue to do so and that more apprentices should be taken on. I completed an apprenticeship between the 1996 and 1999, and I'm so grateful that my employer stuck with me and gave me the opportunity to complete it, even though there were times where it was difficult for that employer because the business was going through some structural change, and they could have easily let me go. But they stuck with me. Now, as an adult looking back on those years when I was an older teenager and a young adult, I'm so grateful for the support that was provided to me. This government is working with industry, working with employers, to ensure that they are able to keep their apprentices, even during this time, and encouraging more businesses to take on more apprentices, because we know that that is going to be critical for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eligibility for the subsidy will be expanded to include medium-sized businesses with 199 employees or fewer and who had an apprentice in place on 1 July 2020. The duration of the wage subsidy will also be extended by six months to cover wages paid up to March 2021. The JobKeeper payment will also support many apprentices and trainees to remain connected to their employer as a result of the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Substantial regulatory and fee relief has also been provided to the vocational education and training sector. Fees charged by ASQA will be refunded or waived. This is important. These measures put some $100 million back into the cash flow of Australian education and training businesses so that this money can be used to retain employees, reshape education offerings and support domestic and international students. There will also be a six-month exemption from the loan fees associated with VET student loans in a bid to encourage full-fee paying students to continue their studies despite these difficult times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are focused on delivering the skills for the future. We have a $585 million skills package designed to strengthen Australia's vocational education and training system. We have a $48.3 million National Skills Commission which provides independent, evidence based advice on the labour market trends and industry driven demand. Industry led skills organisations are also preparing us for jobs of the future, giving us information we need to see what skills are required, what type of qualifications will be most suitable and how our education and training system should adapt for us to take full advantage of the next great industrial opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more that this government is doing to give Australians every possible opportunity to embark and retrain for their career of choice. There is no doubt that the coronavirus challenge has changed the way Australians live, work and study, and the ramification of this change will exist for some time to come. These measures will make sure that we as a nation are well prepared for the future. I'm proud to be a member of this government, which is prepared and which is future-proofing our VET system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite often like to forget that we are paying to fix their failed VET FEE-HELP scheme. Since 2016, over 91,000 students have had their VET FEE-HELP loan debts of over $1.5 billion recredited by the Commonwealth. Australians haven't forgotten what Labor did to the VET sector went they were last in government. Apprenticeships fell by 110,000 between July 2012 and June 2013 after they ripped out $1.2 billion in employer incentives—the largest ever annual decline. We are working with states and territories to reform the system and clean up the mess that was left by federal Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is investing more in a better system. To commit more funding we need to have confidence in a VET system that will deliver what the economy needs. The coalition government is committed to ensuring that we are equipping Australians with the skills that they need for good, secure and long-term jobs. So I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. No matter how many times I stand in this place and speak about the value of vocational education, I am yet to be assured that those opposite are actually listening, because their policies aren't demonstrating that they truly understand the importance and needs of the sectors. The Liberals have slashed funding to TAFE and training, let apprentice numbers fall and presided over a national shortage of tradies, apprentices and trainees. We are not just talking little cuts; the Liberals have cut TAFE and training by over $3 billion. I'll repeat that: $3 billion. We have in those opposite a third-term government who simply refuse to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls the vocational training sector. We need to stop the cuts to TAFE. We need to properly value the educational sector, from early education right through school and tertiary education. We need to recognise that education is something that benefits all of us, not just those who are studying. It's something that we need to invest in as a society for the benefit of society. We need to compete in this century with our partners and competitors overseas as the smart country, not via a race to the bottom on wages and conditions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly in my home state of Tasmania, we have seen that there is a desperate—absolutely desperate!—need for more skilled workers across many sectors of the economy. To grow or even just to continue their operations, businesses need skilled workers. Skills training is especially important for young Tasmanians. I understand the importance of vocational education. While working for the Australian Services Union, I set up the first union job skills program, which obviously included a component of vocational education. I also represented the union on many industry training advisory boards. I know these kinds of training programs can transform the lives of young people. The youth unemployment rate in Tasmania is 15.1 per cent and since March this year 6,400 young people have lost their jobs. Upskilling young Tasmanians is a fantastic way to create jobs and employment opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanian Labor will take to the next Tasmanian state election a policy that advocates for free TAFE and VET education, and I welcome that. The government cannot use COVID-19 as an excuse for reduced numbers of apprenticeships and trainees; there were certainly skill shortages long before COVID-19 hit. Much more needs to be done right now to support apprentices and trainees. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government spent seven years neglecting our TAFE and training system. In Tasmania, we need to train more Tasmanians because we don't have enough of the skilled workers that we need. Many kinds of workers are still being allowed into Tasmania, despite our border restrictions, with claims that there are no suitably qualified Tasmanians available to fill these positions. While I suspect that there are Tasmanians who could do the work if we looked to find them, it still highlights the desperate need to significantly increase the number of people completing vocational education in Tasmania. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need real leadership and a real commitment in this sector. However, the bill before us today does not do that. It makes minor, technical changes to the governance arrangements regarding vocational education. It is just another tweak from the third-term government who simply refuse to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls the vocational training sector. While the bill is welcome—Labor won't oppose it—it is disappointing that the best the government can do is tinker around the edges in a sector which is struggling due to massive funding cuts. This bill does not come close to fixing the mess the Liberal government has made of Australia's TAFE and training system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020 amends the governance structures of The Australian Skills Quality Authority, or ASQA, and enhances information sharing arrangements between ASQA and the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, the NCVER. The legislation builds on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment Bill 2019 and responds to the Braithwaite and Joyce reviews, which both called on ASQA to adopt a greater educative role alongside its regulatory role. The changes also respond to initial findings from the rapid review of ASQA's governance, culture and processes. Key amendments will revise ASQA's governance structure, replacing the existing chief commissioner or chief executive officer and two commissioners with a single independent statutory office holder, and will establish the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council. The advisory council is intended to provide ASQA with access to expert advice regarding the functions of the regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having previously been a member of many Tasmanian advisory committee boards, I feel that an important feature of an advisory council is that it takes advice from a wide range of people, including those who have experience in, or in representing, the sector. Labor knows the value of TAFE and union representation and believe their views should be heard and considered when it comes to the VET sector. Labor's amendments will ensure that the public provider has seats at the table. I hope the crossbench will support our amendments. The reforms in this bill are needed, and we support a fair and considered approach to ASQA reforms. We will support changes that improve ASQA's capacity to ensure responsiveness to students, communities and employers, but we'll reject changes that attempt to weaken ASQA's regulatory framework. We need to ensure that reforms to ASQA's audit processes don't allow any drop in the quality of training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past we've seen that this government is slow to act on quality issues, and it has done serious damage to the sector. More than seven years of Liberal government have left Australia facing a crisis in skills and vocational training. As we learned last year from the federal education department's own data, the Liberals have failed to spend $919 million of their own TAFE and training budget over the past five years. These funds are just sitting in the government's bank account, when they should be used to improve our TAFE system. This is in addition to the more than $3 billion which has already been ripped out of the system. State governments are closing campuses and ending courses; TAFE campuses are falling apart and in desperate need of repair—all while this funding remains unspent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that there has been less demand than forecast every year since the Liberal Party came to office. This comment doesn't stack up when unemployment and underemployment are at near-record levels while, at the same time, employers are crying out for skilled workers. Under the Liberals there are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees and a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. Each of us relies on these services in our lives. We cannot simply close our eyes and wish for problems in the training sector to vanish. Proactive government policies are needed to turn things around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. The independent National Centre for Vocational Education Research recently found that, over the past year, 20 per cent fewer people signed up to trade apprenticeships and traineeships. This drop was even more extreme in a number of essential trades. The number of Australians starting an apprenticeship or traineeship in construction, including carpentry, bricklaying and plumbing, dropped by an alarming 40 per cent. In some areas there are more people dropping out of vocational courses than there are people finishing them. That doesn't happen by accident; it's a consequence of this government's neglect. That's just not good enough—we've got to do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government's underspend of almost $1 billion has affected incentives for businesses to take on apprentices, support to help people finish their apprenticeships, and a fund designed to train Australians in areas of need. We're simultaneously experiencing a crisis of youth unemployment and a crisis of skills shortages. One of these would be bad enough, but here we are confronted with both. To be faced with both at the same time is pretty hard to imagine, especially when there's an easy solution which fixes both: better funding for training in the vocational education sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been an increase of nearly 10 per cent in the number of occupations facing skills shortages. While the Australian Industry Group says that 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find the qualified workers they need, there are almost two million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed. While businesses are struggling to fill the skilled positions they have on offer, we have young people desperate for work who can't fill these positions because they haven't been given the chance to gain the skills that the roles require. Why isn't the government training these people for jobs in industries where there's a shortage of workers? I'll tell you why. It's because the Liberals have cut funding to TAFE and training. I don't know whether it's ideological, whether they're just short-sighted or whether they're maybe a bit snobby and there's a stigma about university and vocational education, but the government refuse to properly fund the sector. They simply refuse to give the sector the proper reform that it so desperately needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people have been clear with what they need. They need a skills training sector that is properly funded, is properly resourced and has educators who are properly trained and able to skill these kids up as a pathway to meaningful employment. Why is this so hard for the government to understand? This government hasn't delivered on a single element of those requests. The Liberal government doesn't care enough or have the capacity to do the hard work that needs to be done to build a better post-school system. Scott Morrison has no plan to fix the skills crisis he created. He has no plan to create more jobs or to lift wages for those who are employed. We've seen a continuous attack on pay, conditions and workers' rights from this government. As always, the Prime Minister would rather hide from problems than do the hard work needed to solve them. He would rather spin and deflect, bringing in marketing teams and celebrity ambassadors to distract from the real issue, because we all know this Prime Minister is all about surface over substance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">JobMaker is another marketing slogan with no real substance. JobTrainer goes nowhere near replacing the funding the government has stripped out, and we still don't know what it will do. Fiddling at the edges of the current system will not address the profound problems that undermine vocational education and training, and, consequently, the productive performance and international competitiveness of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike Labor, the government obviously doesn't understand the critical role of TAFE as the public provider, the values in skills and apprenticeships, or the value of the hardworking and passionate public TAFE teachers. If we continue down this path we will severely jeopardise our future economic growth, undermine the opportunity of individual Australians to meet their full potential, and, very importantly, compromise our ability as a nation to compete with the rest of the world using the skills, knowledge, discovery and invention of our own people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that nine out of 10 jobs created in the future will need a post-secondary school education, either TAFE or university. So we need to increase participation in both universities and our vocational education sector to make sure our young people are prepared for the world of work, which is changing ever so quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This third-term government simply refuses to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls the higher education sector and that properly funds both vocational training providers and universities to deliver the services that their students need. This government has spent seven years ignoring the vital role TAFE plays in the growth of our young people and the vital role it plays in the growth of our economy. It has spent seven years cutting funding models, underspending the meagre amount it promised the sector. Rebuilding our skills and training sector will be crucial to getting the economy going again, and the government needs to properly fund our TAFE and apprenticeship programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen $3 billion of cuts in recent years to TAFE and training. As I said, Labor won't oppose this bill, but the government can and should be doing much, much more to reverse the dreadful effects its cuts have had on the TAFE and vocational education sector. The government must restore that funding that they've cut. The government must invest in training the next generation of tradespeople in our country, because a strong economy relies on a skilled workforce. Young Tasmanians, young Australians, deserve this and the wider Tasmanian and the wider Australian economy needs this, as does the rest of Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise in the Senate today to speak in favour of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. Australia's vocational and education training sector, or the VET sector as we like to call it, provides students across the country with skills and hands-on training for skilled jobs that Australia needs. It's important that we continue to ensure we prioritise quality improvements for VET, including ensuring that regulation of the sector is reasonable, transparent and effective through the Australian Skills Quality Authority, or ASQA. With the onset of COVID-19 it's more important now than ever that we ensure our VET system is working for students, working for employers and working for the wider Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we are discussing here today amends the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 to reform the governance structure of the Australian Skills Quality Authority. The bill will replace the current governance structure of ASQA of a chief commissioner and deputy commissioners with a CEO and an advisory council. This will modernise the regulator so it can take on a greater educative role and have a more effective regulatory approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A review announced by the Morrison government in October 2019 and recommendations from two previous independent reviews have informed the changes within the bill that we're discussing today. The amendments support consistent, fit-for-purpose and effective regulation and will enable stakeholder engagement in Australia's VET sector. The government believes that this improved organisational structure will enable better regulatory decisions, better facilitate internal review and ultimately allow ASQA to be a fit-for-purpose regulator of the VET sector. And, as I alluded to earlier, coming out of the coronavirus crisis, this is absolutely what we need to ensure that our VET sector is fit for purpose and strong and to conserve the needs of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is somewhat fitting that the Senate considers this legislation during National Skills Week. National Skills Week works to raise the profile of and present prospective students with the benefits from undertaking vocational education and training. The career pathways for students undertaking VET are numerous, from cooking to mechanics to building and construction to engineering. Students are provided with the training and hands-on experience they need for their chosen area of expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this virus has wreaked havoc on our economy and has cost so many Australians their job and their income. The Morrison government recognises the stress this unprecedented crisis has placed on Australian workers and their families, and we have acted to ensure that we support Australian through this crisis, through programs, including JobKeeper and jobseeker, and by providing targeted investment to stimulate economic recovery. We know ensuring that Australians are equipped with the right skills and training will be crucial for the next step of our economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The jobs created as we move to a staged focus on recovery will be different to the jobs that were lost when the pandemic took hold. Skilled jobs in growth or expert areas like building and construction, agriculture and renewable energy development will be critical for our economic recovery and will have the potential to place our country in a stronger position than when the crisis commenced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced that it will partner with states and territories to establish a $1 billion JobTrainer fund. This fund will rapidly provide around 340,000 additional training places that are free or low fee in areas of identified skills need for jobseekers and job leavers. We are absolutely taking this COVID-19 crisis seriously. We know skills and training is going to be an incredibly important element of our recovery, and that is why we are making this investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk today about skills and training in my own state of Tasmania, because just last week I had the pleasure of visiting the Huon Valley trade training centre in Huonville. This is one of a number of centres I've visited across Tasmania, including the Sorell trade training centre, and I've been so impressed with the hands-on training and skills that these centres are providing to their students. Trade training centres are specialised training facilities established in regional locations in Tasmania for both school students and adult community members to undertake accredited training in purpose-built facilities. The objectives of the trade training centres are to increase the proportion of students achieving a year 12 or equivalent qualification, to address national skill shortages in traditional trades and emerging industries by improving the relevance and responsiveness of trade training programs in secondary schools, to improve student access to industry-standard trade training facilities, to improve the quality of education offered to secondary students who are undertaking trade related pathways, and to assist young people to make a successful transition from school to work or to further education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important things I've observed about these trade training centres, particularly in Tasmania, is the alignment they have with the local industry. These trade training centres are not directing students into areas where they think there may not be a job at the end of it. Indeed, they're engaging with local employers, understanding what skills and training local employers will require in their future workforce and ensuring that those relevant training courses are available at the local trade training centre. It really is a case of linking local job requirements with the training institutions that are in that area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback I've received from students at our trade training centres is overwhelmingly positive, with the students I've spoken to not only achieving great outcomes during their training but feeling very positive about the prospect of going out in the future and finding a job, once their training is complete. To learn and be able to apply hands-on skills in areas like building and construction, mechanics or cooking gets students excited not only about the skills they are learning but about their future in the workforce. It is amazing to hear some of the stories coming out of trade training centres in Tasmania—positive stories where students are being recruited by local businesses for jobs and apprenticeships, and where students who may have seemed lost during their time in the traditional classroom discover their passion for cooking, building or working on cars. Indeed, many of the students I have been speaking to recently are undertaking multiple training qualifications because they're not necessarily sure of exactly what part of the workforce they want to go into. They've had one experience, they've got one certificate and they understand the value in having a multitude of skills, so they're building on what they're learning and trying to get a diverse understanding of relevant skills that they might need at some point in the workforce. It's a very well balanced education that these kids are receiving at trade training centres. These are amongst some of the skilled jobs that we need for the future, and providing students with access to skills and training in these areas will ensure that they are ready for the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of jobs for the future, Tasmania has an immense competitive advantage over other states when it comes to energy security. Our hydro and renewable energy sector is the envy of other states. The potential to expand our renewable energy resource will require new and skilled workers to work on these nation-building projects. The proposed second interconnector across Bass Strait, the Marinus Link project, has been identified recently as one of the 15 major projects that the Morrison coalition government has given priority status. This project will enable another generation of hydroelectricity development and other energy developments, providing a huge economic and job creation boost for Tasmania. Again, we know that we are going to need skilled workers to undertake these projects. So, to ensure we have the skilled workforce that we need, the Morrison government has committed $17 million through the Energising Tasmania project to equip Tasmanians with the skills to support the Battery of the Nation and Marinus Link initiatives. Energising Tasmania will deliver up to 2½ thousand fully subsidised training places, including traineeships, apprenticeships and preapprenticeships in areas of identified skills need. The deal will ensure assistance of up to $1,000 per learner, also available to cover costs associated with training, such as books and materials. Energising Tasmania is part of the Morrison government's $585 million Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package. As I said, Marinus Link and Battery of the Nation are very exciting projects for Tasmania. I have spoken many times before in this place about just how excited I am as a Tasmanian that we are investing in these projects locally. As I said, we know that we will need skills within our workforce to do these projects, and that's why this government has invested in training locally—to make sure that our local workforce is appropriately trained to deliver on Marinus Link and Battery of the Nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has also committed, locally in Tasmania, $7 million to assist in the construction of a new Trades and Water Centre of Excellence in the state's south to support more Tasmanians to take up careers in trades and electrotechnology. This investment complements the $14 million already committed by the Gutwein Tasmanian Liberal government, which has been a champion of renewable energy development in the state alongside the Morrison coalition government. The campus in the south will expand its training platform to train students for building and construction, plumbing and water, refrigeration and air conditioning, and smart building technologies. This is a very exciting investment in the south of Tasmania that will make sure that our VET sector continues to be strong and continues to align with the skills that we know our workforce is going to need coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I gave my first speech in this place, I referenced the fact that I stood for the Senate because I've seen too many Tasmanians have to leave our island for job opportunities. They don't feel that they have job opportunities locally at home. Since the Morrison coalition government was elected, I've seen the change in the culture of Tasmania. We are looking more to opportunities at home. I certainly wouldn't want to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our local economy being that young Tasmanians feel that they can't have opportunities locally, that we go back to the dark old days where everyone used to leave our island for work. So I'm certainly glad to see this government taking seriously the issues of skills and training in our local areas, particularly in our regional areas, to make sure that young people have the skills they need to be able to work locally so that we don't see another generation of Tasmanians leaving our island for work, to make sure that young Tasmanians can work at home if they want to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly hope that COVID-19 hasn't completely railroaded our plans. I'm a proud Tasmanian. I want to see more opportunities for young Tasmanians at home. I think strengthening our VET sector through legislation like that we are discussing here today is a really important way to do that. I commend the bill to the Senate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  It seems appropriate to be talking about national vocational education and training during this week, National Skills Week. This is a chance for us to acknowledge just how important TAFE and training are for our communities. Right now, as we face a jobs crisis in this country, we must acknowledge that TAFE and training are a key part of getting our country back on track. But this bill is just another tweak, and it's a tweak from a third-term government which has actually spent seven years undermining and underfunding our critical TAFE system. While this bill largely implements the recommendations of independent reviews that have been supported by the sector, there are still some concerns. There remains uncertainty as to how some of the changes contained in this bill will work in practice. This isn't helped by the lack of consultation that many stakeholders in the sector have reported on this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at the real issue here, which is this government's record of failure and neglect on skills and training—seven years, three terms, three prime ministers, each of them just as responsible as the last for the skills crisis that Australia currently finds itself in. This is a skills crisis that existed before the COVID-19 crisis, a skills crisis that will hold back Australia's economic recovery. In this country, we have a serious mismatch between the skills that workers have to offer and the skills that businesses need. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, more than two million people were unable to find enough work. At the same time, businesses couldn't find workers with the skills that they needed. That has got a whole lot worse. Today over 2.5 million Australians are unemployed or underemployed. This is a number that we know, tragically, is predicted to keep rising. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the government's own skills shortage list, you will find that as a country we are lacking people with the skills to become bakers, nurses, electricians, midwives, early childhood educators, teachers and so many more. Employers are actually crying out for people for these roles. So why is it that so many children finishing school today cannot count on their government to deliver them the skills, training and education that are needed to fill those vacancies? These are core jobs, essential jobs, and yet as a country we can't fill them. This is just one example of how the government can barely manage today's economy, let alone manage the recovery and the future that we need to grapple with right now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we have those skills shortages? It is because of seven years of cuts, seven years of neglect. In Victoria, my home state, we've seen the loss of 35,000 apprentices and trainees since the coalition came to government. That's a loss of over one-third of Victoria's apprentices and trainees. Across the nation, over 140,000 apprentices and trainees have been lost. The Liberals and Nationals have cut $3 billion from TAFE and training. We've heard today that Treasury expects effective unemployment to reach 13 per cent by the end of the year. We currently have over one million Australians unemployed—the first time in Australia's history that that figure has been reached. TAFE, training and apprenticeships are going to be crucial in ensuring that Australians have the skills for the jobs that become available as we recover from this recession. So we cannot afford for the Morrison government to continue down this path of cuts to and neglect of our public TAFE and training system, a path that will undermine our recovery, a path that will undermine the opportunity for so many Australians to get the education they need to secure the jobs that they need today and for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts are locking Australians out of TAFE and training, and that is locking Australians out of jobs. This is what it should be all about right now for this government—jobs, saving jobs, creating jobs and making sure Australians have the skills to do those jobs. At a time when unemployment and underemployment are at record levels, this government cannot tell us what its plan is for jobs. This government has no plan for our recovery. Right now, the government is far more interested in photo ops, another press release, another press conference and another reactive announcement, without the follow-through that is really needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the JobTrainer program? What is it going to do to make up for seven years of cuts to and neglect of TAFE and training? What is the HomeBuilder program? It's a program that is not building any homes. And the JobMaker program? If someone in the government could tell us what that is we would really appreciate it. It's another program, another slogan, another name without a plan and without anything real that Australians can get behind to know that they are going to have good, decent and secure jobs with the help of this government. This government is too busy announcing plans that are all talk and no substance, plans that are so light on detail they don't really make it past 24 hours in the media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to TAFE, training and skills, this government vacated the field when it came to power seven years ago. A government without a plan for education and skills is a government without a plan for the future. Right now, it screams of a government without a plan for our economic recovery either. Now, more than ever, we need a government that is serious about creating good, decent and secure jobs and one that will provide Australians with the skills they need to do those jobs. No more nonplans, no more empty announcements and no more tweaks to legislation—we need a real plan for jobs and we need it now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, Labor understand the value of TAFE and training. We know that vocational education is a key part of Australia's recovery. We will always back a strong, comprehensive regulatory compliance and education framework for ASQA. We'll support a fair and considered approach to ASQA reforms. We'll support this bill. But this bill in the current environment is just more tweaks to a vocational training sector that needs a national plan and needs proper support from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we're going to need skilled workers to recover from this recession and that people desperately need good and secure jobs that are supported by quality training. The Labor team are focused on this and we have always been focused on this. Last year, Labor leader Anthony Albanese announced our intention to establish 'Jobs and Skills Australia', and this is the type of reform we should be talking about right here, right now, today. An independent statutory authority would provide a genuine partnership with business leaders, state and territory governments, unions and education providers, bringing everyone together to make sure that workers have access to the skills and jobs that they need and that businesses have access to the skilled workers that they need and are seeking as well. This will be a model of genuine partnership and collaboration, investing in the skills of Australian workers. That is the sort of reform that we should be talking about here today in the Senate and in this parliament in the middle of this crisis, in the middle of the first recession in almost 30 years. We need this kind of plan now, more than ever, as we look forward to a recovery post COVID-19. On this side of the chamber, in the Labor team, we have a vision for decent and stable jobs that are supported by quality training. This is in Labor's DNA. We see education and training as an investment in our future, and we will always support hardworking Australians who want a quality education. We will always support good, secure jobs for all Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise today to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020, and I do so with the great pleasure that my good friend and colleague Senator Michaelia Cash is in front of me in the chamber, because no-one is a greater advocate for jobs—and, particularly, VET jobs—in this place than Minister Cash. I have been lucky enough to be out and about with Minister Cash on a few occasions over the past couple of months, and one of the key focuses of our visits together, particularly into regional WA, has been the needs of businesses in attracting and training high-quality VET graduates and apprentices. It's great to see, through this measure, the government again building on the strong commitment we have to making sure that our VET sector is as strong as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody doubts and nobody would argue—certainly not Minister Cash—that there are some major challenges ahead of the VET sector in the current circumstances. But the Australian government's commitment to a skilled economy—to boost our economic recovery—has never been stronger. In fact, it is one of the key ways in which we are going to be able to build our economy out of this pandemic induced economic downturn, one of the ways we will be growing our economy into the future and one of the ways we will be making sure as many Australians as possible—all those Australians who want a job—can get a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government are contributing an additional $2 billion to the new $2½ billion JobTrainer package dedicated to reforming the vocational education and training sector and keeping apprentices in jobs. There will be $1 billion allocated to set up the JobTrainer fund, with 50 per cent to be funded by the states and territories in recognition of the economic benefits that flow to those state and territories from a strong job-training sector. This will mean more Australians will have access to free or low-cost training places, particularly in areas of need, and we certainly see that out and about in rural WA. A further $1½ billion will be allocated to expanding and extending the Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage subsidy, which was first announced in March of this year. The package responds to the challenges of the labour market because, as I have said, of the COVID-19 pandemic and is the next step in the sector reform process outlined by the Prime Minister as part of the government's JobMaker agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Skills reform and strengthening our VET sector is central to the government's JobMaker plan to support Australia's economic recovery and our future growth. An unprecedented number of Australians are without work—many for the first time in their lives—due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On top of this, around 250,000 students will leave school at the end of this year. In that environment, obviously, it will be difficult for many of those students or ex-students to find employment immediately, in which case the VET sector particularly will become an increasingly important source of training opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I have been out and about with Minister Cash over the last few months. I want to highlight a few of the opportunities that are out there in regional Western Australia in particular and also some of the challenges we do face. Most recently, I was at the Bunbury Jobs Fair with Minister Cash. Jobs fairs are an extraordinary opportunity, and, at that particular jobs fair, the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Industry came down to Bunbury. Kalgoorlie has a particular challenge at the moment. It has a significant number of employment opportunities available but not the people willing to relocate to Kalgoorlie to take them up. It faces a particular set of challenges. This is quite ironic at a time when we're seeing, unfortunately, the unemployment rate increasing. I give a shout-out to all those who can get to Kalgoorlie and have the skills required, although there's a lot of training available for upskilling into those jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great things Minister Cash and I heard at that job fair was that, as a result of the previous job fair in Kalgoorlie, a number of individuals have entered full-time employment. So we are seeing actions linking individuals with training and directly resulting in job outcomes for those individuals. That is a key driver of the future economic growth we all want and need to see for Australia to recover strongly from the pandemic. It also gives individuals hope and opportunities that were not necessarily there before. These job fairs are a great way of linking people not just with a job but with training and a job. That's one of the key things we need to keep reminding all the people out there who want a job and are looking for an opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The job fair program is certainly great. Obviously these are challenging times for large events like that to proceed. I know the minister's department put an extraordinary amount of effort into making sure that the event itself was COVID safe. There were a large number of participating exhibitors who had jobs or training on offer and also a large number of individuals keen to see what opportunities are out there and to talk about the potential work and training opportunities that are available. So even with the COVID-safe requirements that we are all currently living under we saw a large number of people turning out and learning about those opportunities and talking to businesses and training providers face-to-face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a large number of businesses. There were some Indigenous-owned cleaning businesses, for example. One business we met started up in the last couple of years and has gone from strength to strength. It has grown from two employees to 20 employees in the space of a couple of years. This is the kind of activity want to see in our economy. We want to see training available to enable people who are unskilled or who need to reskill to enter those growing job opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently I was at De Rosa's Highway Motors in Waroona in south-west WA. Nick and his team are one of the premier farm machinery dealers in the south-west of WA. They service dairy, sheep and beef farmers as well as orchardists in the district. Nick is a salt-of-the-earth character from the bush. He's really passionate about giving local youth a go. He wants local youth to take up the opportunities that are available in his hometown. This business has been there for the vast majority of my life—I'd hate to say how long it has been there. When we drove to our own farm in Pemberton we passed De Rosa's Highway Motors in Waroona on many hundreds, if not thousands, of occasions. They are an institution in that part of the world. As I said, Nick is dedicated to giving local kids a go in mechanical apprenticeships. One thing I hear constantly throughout regional Western Australia is the need for people to take up mechanical apprenticeships and to have an opportunity to do diesel mechanic training in the VET sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AFGRI, another large farm machinery dealership throughout the Wheatbelt of Western Australia, has a significant training program of its own. It has something like 25 ongoing apprenticeships in any given year. It trains a lot of people in the full knowledge that the skills are highly sought after. A lot of those young men and women will end up being poached by mining companies. That's the reality of the training they do, and they train more than they need on the basis that many of them will go elsewhere. That's great for those individuals. It's a great opportunity. Those kinds of businesses are putting that effort into local training because it means they can continue to grow their own businesses, it means they can give locals an opportunity to get some high-quality skills, and it gives those young people an opportunity to develop a base of skills that allow them to move, to seek opportunities elsewhere and to advance their own life prospects—by perhaps going to the mining industry for a few years before coming back to the Wheatbelt, or perhaps going to the mining industry permanently. There are some challenges, absolutely, but also some wonderful opportunities out there for young Australians and Australians who are seeking to retrain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on the situation in WA, a couple of months ago Minister Cash and I visited John Fitzhardinge at Dongara Marine—again, a wonderful success story in regional WA. This is a boat-building company that has been building boats in Western Australia since 1975. Situated in what is a tiny coastal community, Dongara, just south of Geraldton, it's a regional business that is absolutely punching well above its weight, taking on a wide range of projects for both the private sector and government clients. It's building, for example, six-metre tenders for ecotourism in the Abrolhos Islands region, rigid inflatable marine rescue vessels and the 20-metre Berkeley class pilot boats in service in the Fremantle Ports. This boat has been described by one Fremantle pilot as the Rolls-Royce of pilot boats. Dongara Marine are also involved in building the new Transperth catamaran, the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Tricia</span>, which plies the Swan River, just down from the CPO, if anyone is ever over in Western Australia—I know it's a bit hard these days for us all to move around. The Swan River Transperth 'cat ferries' are very well known to all Western Australians and are very much a feature of the city. The fact that that new vessel, the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Tricia</span>, was built just north of Perth in a small regional town is a great credit to Dongara Marine and to John and his business partners, who continue to support the opportunities for young local apprentices in that industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were up there, Minister Cash and I saw a number of young Australians who had recently arrived in apprenticeships or were just about to complete apprenticeships—again, across a range of fields, from boat building to diesel mechanics to electrical engineering. So the opportunities are out there, particularly in the regions, and this government is committed to doing everything it can to support those opportunities. It is a difficult time for those who do not have a job, but the key message from today is that the opportunities are out there. Maybe you have to think a little bit differently about what those opportunities may be for you, going forward, but when you see the number of people who go along to events like the jobs fairs in Kalgoorlie and in Bunbury you know that there are opportunities for training and for jobs. There are also many, many people out there seeking those opportunities. I think that is a very positive thing for the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I rise in support of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. Australia's vocational education and training sector is a vital driver of our economy. The VET sector provides education and training for key industries and services through a network of private and public registered training organisations. Having a high-quality VET sector is fundamental to keeping our workforce skilled and our economy productive. However, due to the debacle of Labor's VET FEE-HELP scheme, the quality and reputation of Australia's VET sector have taken a significant hit, where once the sector was regarded as among the best in the world. This bill comes as one more essential step in a long line of amendments brought by this Liberal-National government to repair the damage done by Labor and get vocational education and training in Australia back on track. The bill deals specifically with the national VET regulator, ASQA, making several changes and improvements to increase its efficiency and transparency in regulating the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the VET FEE-HELP scheme was introduced in 2008 and operated as a HECS type loan for vocational education students, where the government paid tuition costs and students would start paying off their loan once their income reached a high enough threshold. At the time, the loans were quite limited and were not widely used, which led to a further overhaul of the scheme in 2012 by the Gillard Labor government. The revised version of the scheme dropped many of the earlier restrictions in an attempt to open the scheme to more students and trainees. This weakened the dam wall, so to speak, and opened a lucrative niche for a flood of private registered training organisations to move in and take advantage of the loan scheme as a government funded cash cow, in many cases with little regard for student outcomes. The RTOs maximised their profits simply by maximising their enrolments, irrespective of the circumstances or background of the students they enrolled. By signing up as many students as possible, unscrupulous RTOs could quickly establish huge cash flows, as the government paid based on the number of student enrolments, regardless of whether or not students finished the course, qualified or even were able to meet the requirements of the course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To rake in as much taxpayer money as possible, some RTOs went to great lengths to trick, coerce and bribe students into signing up for their courses. A common and quite blatant inducement advertised by RTOs was to offer free laptops or iPads simply for signing up to a course. In making their sales pitch, shonky training providers would often deliberately target uninformed people, implying there were no upfront costs and misleading them about their liability to pay fees and service the debt. Brokers were hired to recruit the most vulnerable people, including the old, unemployed, less educated and disadvantaged, using the marketing tactics of cold calling, handing out leaflets, setting up shopping centre booths and selling door to door. On top of this, many courses were of very poor quality and extremely overpriced. In one instance, an online business course from a private RTO with no reputation to speak of cost a jaw-dropping $8,000 more than a similar course offered by a prestigious Melbourne university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the Gillard government just kept paying. There was no quality control and there were no audits or checks and balances—nothing. Labor just kept shovelling taxpayers' money out the door. This behaviour from RTOs was outrageously unethical and, due to the poor design of the scheme, far too easy to get away with. The total value of loans jumped from $25.6 million in 2009 to $2.9 billion in 2015. Many of the students who received these loans will never reach the income threshold, meaning that the costs will be forever borne by hardworking Australian taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This catastrophe was entirely due to the Labor government's negligence and mishandling of the scheme. An audit of the scheme published in 2016 found that the government did not establish processes to ensure that all objectives, risks and consequences were managed in implementing the expanded scheme. In effect, the quality and integrity of much of the available education and training was trashed in the name of expanding the sector. Labor's VET FEE-HELP scheme simply did not have an appropriate level of accountability and regulation to balance the systemic risk of abuse that comes with such a scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is invariably a great deal of risk involved when it comes to the government handing out so-called free money, so strict regulation is needed in order to mitigate those risks. Legislation must always be designed to account for the lowest common denominator, with all the contingencies provided for, because if there is an opportunity for exploitation there will always be someone out there to do it. Government should never be in such a hurry as to let enthusiasm for change take pre-eminence over accountability, transparency and due diligence when it comes to good and effective legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has been working for several years to clean up the mess caused by the VET FEE-HELP scheme. Reform in this area has occurred incrementally and methodically to limit disruption to legitimate RTOs and to protect the many students who use the loans scheme. The point needs to be made that, despite the financial abuses that occurred, unscrupulous RTOs made up only a relatively small portion of providers, and students shouldn't suffer any further because of bad policy. Most significantly, in this process the VET FEE-HELP scheme was entirely scrapped in 2016 and replaced with a new system, the VET Student Loans scheme, which is far better designed, with stricter vetting and enforced loan caps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the government is introducing this bill in order to further improve the national VET regulator, ASQA, to keep RTOs in check so that widespread abuse of the system won't be possible in the future. Having an appropriately governed regulator means that skills training will be delivered in a more efficient manner. This is important—the high-quality sort of skills training that is needed to help us come up with the best possible post-COVID workforce. The new governance structure within ASQA means that a CEO and advisory council will be able to take a greater educative role and have a more modern approach to regulating the VET sector. The new expert advisory council means that those who are best placed to understand the nuances of this highly diverse sector are best positioned to help guide it into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Important privacy safeguards will be put in place to ensure that the data of vulnerable students is not shared inappropriately and will also help buttress the vulnerable against potential abuse such as we saw under Labor. It is tremendously important to recognise that at a time like this skills and training are more important than ever. VET reform is a key pillar of the Morrison government's JobMaker plan. We on this side of the chamber know that all jobs are worth supporting, not just those of tertiary-educated Labor and Greens voters in the inner cities. We have announced $2.8 billion to support apprentices and trainees since the COVID pandemic hit, and we will continue to keep pushing to ensure that vocational education has a strong backbone of funding and rigorous and appropriate oversight. It is and always will be core to our economy and should never be considered an afterthought. A stable, well-functioning VET sector that continues to turn out skilled, appropriately qualified workers is essential to Australian industry. It is essential to the strength of our economy and essential to the wellbeing of our society as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make the necessary improvements that are needed in order for ASQA to fulfil an effective certification and oversight role, providing the checks and balances needed for the vocational education and training sector to flourish. A good and effective regulator was one of the key elements missing from Labor's VET FEE-HELP scheme. It was a vital missing ingredient that almost guaranteed that rampant misconduct and poor quality would infect many RTOs. With the passage of this bill ASQA will take a giant step forward to be the highly effective regulator our VET sector needs. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise to speak about the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. I will be voting for this bill. Everyone knows that ASQA needs reform. Australia needs ASQA to be a cop on the beat. We've seen too much evidence of what happens without one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen providers take our kids for a ride, charging them tens of thousands of dollars for qualifications worth little more than the paper they're printed on. Some of those kids, by the way, are still waiting for their money back. So, if someone could get onto that for about the third time since I've been in here, that would be good. Some of these guys have really ripped off our kids. So, if we can get onto it, that would be great. It's about time the government started doing something about that. Those qualifications are not worth the paper they're printed on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the government is tinkering at the edges here. What's new? They're doing the bare minimum they need to. What's new? It makes me sad to say this, but they just don't care enough to make our TAFEs thrive. It's all just lip-service. Our tradies and the people they work for need so much more. They need a vision. They need support from government to get kids trained up and into jobs that will rebuild our economy. Don't tell me we're going to start rebuilding our economy, we're going into manufacturing and we're going into infrastructure, when our kids out there have got no jobs and no apprenticeships because the TAFEs are not up and running. This is the problem. And it's becoming a bigger problem. I've got people down there in Tasmania waiting 18 months to get new houses built because we don't have qualified tradesmen and we don't have the apprentices because we don't have the TAFEs open. That's the problem. That's what the economists and the government tells us that we need to make our way out of this economic crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone knows that construction, manufacturing and care work will get us through. That's what our economy and our people need and they need it now. They needed it yesterday. My question to the government is: how will we do that when our TAFEs are on their knees? They are sick of the lip-service that's coming from the coalition. They have absolutely had enough of it. This bill is a bit of nothing, basically. That's all it is. It is a waste of bloody time in this Senate chamber. Maybe the regulator's board's operations could be improved. Do you know what else could be improved? Literally everything about the way we do trades and training in this country. Trades and training, that's my problem with this bill. It's a bit like fixing the roof when the foundations are already dodgy. What's the point? We have states announcing record spending on infrastructure but we don't have the tradies to get it done. How about that? That's what happens when you rely on all these 457s and everything else in the past. Things are going to change and no-one's changing with them. We're not changing in here. We're still not ready to give our kids an opportunity through TAFE. We're still not spending the money in there. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TAFEs are where our fireys, our paramedics and our aged-care workers are trained. They are meant to be essential workers. If these jobs are classed as essential, how come it's not essential to fix where they are being trained? How do you get them trained if you don't have the facilities prepared to train them? Don't even start me on not having the teachers prepared to train them, because you don't have that either. It is shameful. Here we go with the government once again making a big song and dance about this so-called JobTrainer program. It is just a reworded something else; that's all. I'll tell you what, this government does slogans pretty well, but the trouble is you've been doing them that well, the Australian people have caught up with you, and they're onto it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to know is: what is the government actually doing to make sure our kids can get a decent vocational education after they've finished school? How are we going to get those unemployed workers out there retrained and into a decent job? Our TAFEs should be there to do that for people. Australians should be able to rely on their local TAFE to give them the skills they need to contribute to rebuilding our economy. But I'll tell you what these big talkers have done so far. They've brought out their fancy marketing campaign to try and hide—</span>

Can I, at the outset, express my sincere condolences to every family that, during the pandemic, has lost a loved one who was a resident in aged care. Can I also say that I should have had the data on Friday and I apologise for not having done that. To my colleagues—noting that I have successfully taken the attention away from where it should be, which is our efforts to combat the virus—and also to the Senate, I say that I should have had the information. It is my fault and my responsibility. I take full responsibility for not having that information available to me at the time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, nationally, since the commencement of the pandemic, 335 Australians have passed away in residential care and in home care. Seven home-care recipients and 328 residential-care recipients have passed away. It's an absolute tragedy. Every single one of those deaths is an absolute tragedy. That's why this government has worked so hard since the beginning of the pandemic, firstly, to put in place measures to protect Australia through the national health pandemic plan. Then there are the other measures that we've put in place, which now total in excess of $1 billion, to support the residential aged-care sector to manage the virus and to protect Australians, particularly those in residential aged care, because we know that, if they contract the virus, they are the most vulnerable. So, right from the outset in January, when we first started talking to the sector with respect to what they ought be doing in preparation, then with the national health pandemic plan that we put together—<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As we've seen over recent months, supporting Victoria to suppress community transmission of COVID-19 is critical not just to economic recovery, of course, but also to save lives. Sadly, as a result of the second wave of COVID-19, we have now seen over 517 Australians lose their lives. The Morrison government has stepped up our support to the Victorian government to assist them in combating the effects of COVID-19. The Australian government's Department of Health is assisting the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services to undertake contact tracing. Over 1,700 Australian defence personnel are currently deployed to Victoria to assist with contact tracing, testing, logistics and Victorian police checkpoints. In July and August, the government substantially increased dispatches of personal protective equipment, PPE, from the National Medical Stockpile. Of the more than 66 million masks dispatched from the National Medical Stockpile to date, over 23 million masks have been dispatched to Victoria, including nine million masks dispatched for Victorian aged-care providers. The Australian government is dispatching 186,000 goggles from the National Medical Stockpile to assist Victorian general practitioners and allied health providers. Additionally, the Australian government has established 28 GP led respiratory clinics in Victoria, providing free, holistic care and testing for patients with respiratory illness. Respiratory clinics in Victoria have assessed more than 153,200 people and have now conducted over 138,000 tests.</span>

We are investing $26.9 million to create 15 mental health clinics across Victoria: nine in Melbourne and six in regional Victoria. We're investing $5 million to enhance digital and phone services for groups that are experiencing significant challenges during the restrictions that are now in place, and $14.6 million to support mental health providers respond to increased demand in Victoria, including $5 million to support headspace, $2 million to support the Kids Helpline, $2.5 million to support Lifeline and $2.5 million to support Beyond Blue. The impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, physical distancing and isolation can make us feel anxious, stressed and worried.

I am so proud of the efforts of the Defence department and our ADF—and their family's support—during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADF very quickly adapted and developed new business-as-usual processes and practices during COVID-19. We did that to ensure Defence keeps our people in Australia, and over 2,000 personnel deployed overseas, safe—safe when on training exercises, when on exercises on operational deployments and also when on routine postings. We did that to make sure that we adapted very early and that we now maintain the best possible health protocols.</span>

Support has been provided in many forms—in traditional tasks, such as planning, logistics and also in health support, but a number of new tasks, such as contact tracing and also training to drive ambulances.</span>

Our ADF personnel have been assisting Victorian authorities since 23 March this year with its COVID-19 response. Since then we have supported 11 separate Victorian requests for assistance. Today, 1,700 defence personnel are deployed to Victoria to support its latest efforts to get this next wave under control. For example, 338 ADF personnel are supporting contact tracing through data management, admin and logistic support and also doorknocking close contacts unable to be contacted by phone; 250 ADF personnel are supporting COVID-19 testing right across the state of Victoria; 150 ADF personnel are supporting seven Victoria Police vehicle control points; and, as I said, ADF are providing support in new ways, including doing training with Ambulance Victoria and also now doing training and assistance to the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre. Again, I thank them all for their service— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The ADF has been providing critically important support to the Western Australian government authorities since 22 March this year. Since then we have supported 10 separate WA requests for assistance. Today 112 ADF personnel are on the ground in Western Australia. At its peak, on 22 April, the ADF had 326 personnel assisting Western Australian authorities with their COVID-19 response. This builds on the support the ADF had provided earlier in March to assist with the cruise ship disembarkation, and that assistance provided included assistance with quarantine compliance checks and a range of logistics support, including cargo transportation.</span>

The $171 million that we announced on Friday was a further contribution towards our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. That's what it was specifically targeted to do; it wasn't designed to fix the aged-care sector. It's a different situation. We are currently in the middle of a royal commission into the aged-care sector, which was given the task of forensically looking at the entire aged-care sector and then coming back to government with recommendations on what we should do to improve the residential aged-care sector in this country—in fact, that includes the home care sector. We are watching that process very closely. Our officials engage with the commission on a regular basis. They continue to issue papers, including one that they issued this morning with respect to quality indicators. We will respond, as I have said and as the Prime Minister has said, to the royal commission when it makes its recommendations. I acknowledge, and the Prime Minister has acknowledged—it's why we called the royal commission—that there are issues with residential aged care and the aged-care sector more broadly in this country. Clearly, there are. That's why we called the royal commission. We look forward to its report when it reports on 26 February next year. The objective that I have, and I know that the Prime Minister has, is for us to make a significant response to that royal commission report in our budget next year. So that's the timeline we have. We acknowledge that additional funding is required for this sector, and we have invested significantly in this sector in the last two budgets, in excess of, say, $3 billion for 50,000 home care places. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

With respect to your comments about a number of other countries, we actually are doing better than all of those—significantly better than all of those. In fact, our circumstance with respect to infections in residential aged care as the number of deaths as a proportion of aged-care places is 35 times better than the UK. </span>

We've done that on a consistent basis, and we will continue to do that. This morning we released the Newmarch report, which I provided directly to every single aged-care provider in the country. We've already implemented a lot of the learnings from Newmarch in our response in Victoria. We continue to do that, and we continue to work with residential aged-care providers across the country, including a decision out of national cabinet last Friday where we will be working, through the quality and safety commission, with states to visit every provider, commencing in Tasmania and Queensland, to ensure that their systems are up to speed. And, if we find an opportunity for improvement, we'll push for that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But, as I've said a number of times, every death from COVID-19 in an aged-care facility, every death from COVID-19, is an absolute tragedy—every death. I again offer my condolences to all of them. But this government has, since January, worked extremely closely with the sector to provide it with advice and resources to assist it to manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Have we got it right all the time? No, we haven't, and I've acknowledged that. But we continue, as we learn about this virus which didn't exist before November last year, to learn more about the way it spreads, and we learn more about the measures we need to take. We continue to implement those, and we are still learning. We are still talking to the AHPPC about what more we might do. We are still discussing at national cabinet level what more we might do so we can continue to provide quality care and protect senior Australians who are in residential aged care and home care from the scourge of this terrible virus which, when it gets into that aged cohort, has absolutely devastating results. That's what we will continue to do. We will continue to invest, we continue to learn and we will continue to work closely with the sector, as we've done right through the pandemic.</span>

And we've worked very closely and we've worked very hard, taking the advice of the medical professionals in the AHPPC to provide advice to the sector—and the subcommittees of the AHPPC, the CDNA, who've provided guidance, updated now on three occasions, to the sector. I think the sector has done well. We've been extremely fortunate in this country that the front line of our defences—closing our borders early, including to China, and setting up our national COVID-19 health response—has been largely effective. We didn't expect that the systems in Victoria would fall down in the way that they did, but as that's occurred we've continued to respond and to build our response. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I commissioned a highly respected economist, Dr Alan Moran, to review government economic and energy data and to calculate the true cost of climate policies and so-called renewable energy. He delivered his report to me last week, and a copy has been sent to every member of federal parliament, including Senator Birmingham and the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Dr Moran's work cannot be sensibly refuted since he uses the government's own data, which used to be published in a consolidated form until the cost of intermittent solar and wind energy sources became so embarrassingly and devastatingly high. Is the minister aware that the true cost of climate policies on households through electricity prices is a staggering $1,300 per household per year?</span>

For residential customers who were on the higher standing offers before 1 July last year, they could well be better off by up to $666 per annum in New South Wales, $590 in South Australia or $725 in South-East Queensland—in Senator Roberts's home state.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are making tangible differences to household energy prices and are bringing them down. Our introduction of a reference price, requiring retailers to advertise offers in a way that is transparent and easy to compare, has, according to the ACCC, seen the cheapest market offer as at September last year—some $290 to $355 lower in New South Wales, $262 lower in South-East Queensland and $330 lower in South Australia. Indeed, as well average wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market in the first quarter of this year were the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2016. Our reforms are making a difference in terms of energy prices at the wholesale level and the retail level, and we will continue to work to reduce them.</span>

As a government our focus continues to be on getting energy prices down whilst meeting our emission reduction obligations and ensuring reliability in the energy markets. We are recording achievements across all of those three spheres in terms of meeting the emission reduction obligations and commitments that we've made as a country; improving and delivering more reliability in the energy grid, despite some of the challenges there have been previously; and, as I was outlining before, getting prices down at a wholesale level and at a retail level for households and businesses. The ABS tells us that we've seen reductions in the national average retail price over the last year. That benefits both households and businesses. The AER showed in a recent report that high standing offers have been eliminated. These tangible differences are flowing through in electricity bills for Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That results in a net loss of jobs in the economy. Analysis of Spain's experience indicates that, with every green subsidised job, 2.2 real jobs are lost. With over one million Australians losing their job and unemployment rising due to COVID-19, shouldn't the government be stimulating job creation, not job losses?</span>

Our effort in deploying other policies, such as the home builder program, to head off potential declines in the construction industry; our effort to support the creative arts sector by attracting more production to Australia and supporting job generation and creation there; and our effort in terms of skills investment that Senator Cash is leading to make sure that Australians who may not have work at present are able to retrain for the future are all about creating jobs and helping Australians to get back into the employment market as we recover.</span>

We have also delivered urgently needed humanitarian supplies, prepositioned at the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in the Middle East, and have provided those to NGO partners leading the response in Beirut. On Friday 14 August, a Middle East based ADF C-130 delivered mobile warehouses to help replace critical storage facilities destroyed in the blast and also shelter kits and tools for the up to 300,000 people left homeless. Then, last Friday, the ADF completed a second delivery of additional shelter materials. I acknowledge the support of those personnel in effecting those deliveries.</span>

Fortunately, only minor injuries were experienced by staff, and we appreciate the support provided to them to address those injuries. I don't, however, underestimate the psychological challenge that accompanies the experience that those staff have had, and I acknowledge the ambassador and her team for the very professional work that they are doing. They've been working constantly to help Australians, and we deployed additional staff to Beirut to assist in the response as well. Our staff are providing consular assistance, working actively to identify opportunities for Australians in Beirut to depart, particularly in terms of the current incoming passenger restrictions, which do make that harder. They're providing many essential services, including the provision of emergency passports, and are also continuing to make inquiries of local authorities—there are always many dual nationals in Beirut, and in Lebanon more broadly—about any further support that may be required by people in those circumstances.</span>

It's admirable. It reminded us of the close relationship between our two countries, particularly through the almost quarter-of-a-million Australians of Lebanese heritage. Since the explosion, the government has convened a series of special teleconference meetings with leaders of the Australian Lebanese community. Minister Tudge and I attended one of those meetings, Minister Hawke another. They've been very important chances both to convey our condolences and to listen to the community's priorities as they are applied here in Australia and also to family and extended contacts in Lebanon. For any Australians who wish to help, we do encourage them to provide a cash donation to trusted organisations that are delivering this urgently needed humanitarian assistance. We're working with the Lebanese community on the best mechanisms to achieve this, and we certainly thank them for the commitment that they are bringing to the task.</span>

                  </a>  One of the more pre-emptive points of order I've ever heard. The Australian government is primarily responsible for funding and regulation of the aged-care sector, and part of that regulatory process is a number of standards which aged-care providers are responsible for meeting. That includes management of infection control and a range of other measures. There are 44 items that have to be complied with in the standards, and we regulate and assess all aged-care providers across the country to ensure that they do meet those standards. Of course, we have processes to deal with them if they don't. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 22 July this year the federal government made and announced the decision that it will not be appealing the Federal Court case which ruled in favour of the Brett Cattle Company. Losses and damages will be appropriately determined by the court because we believe that the prolonged pain and hardship that has been caused to this industry has gone on long enough. On this side of the chamber we believe that the industry deserves certainty. We believe it deserves our support going forward and that certainty has been denied this industry for some time now. The livelihoods of producers were basically cut off overnight, and our focus from here on has to be on supporting our farmers, our exporters and the people that support that industry. They are an absolutely integral part of the Australian economy and have never been more important than they are now, along with our resources sector, as key pillars to support Australia through the absolute pain and devastation of this current COVID crisis. It is a $1.7 billion industry that supports our economy. There are over 10,000 jobs within the industry and in associated industry. We as a government are absolutely strongly committed to supporting and growing the value of agriculture, and that includes our live export industry. We have a very strong record of doing it and we will continue to do it. This was jeopardised. We're going to fix that problem now.</span>

This government is absolutely 100 per cent committed to supporting our farmers, and that includes our live cattle producers. This government has committed over $10 billion across the country to supporting drought response and recovery and preparedness actions following the 2019 floods. We also committed $3.3 billion in additional support measures. The National Drought and North Queensland Flood Response and Recovery Agency made available $300 million in grants to support restocking and replanting, as well as rebuilding on-farm infrastructure that was damaged. This funding is helping all agriculture but particularly our cattle producers to get back on their feet, because we know that when they are on their feet they do great things for the Australian economy. </span>

We have a framework in place which focuses continually on making sure that we improve and to make sure that the industry meets the community's expectations. There are standards for things like vessel preparation, sourcing, loading and on-board management of livestock—making sure that things like ventilation, drainage, stock densities and the provision of food and water to animals on these vessels are absolutely first class. We always make sure that there is an accredited stockperson on board the ship and in many instances there is a veterinarian as well. The framework also includes processes to investigate when a situation does occur and there is an incident. But we need to remember the overwhelming number of voyages that leave Australia with live animals on board are undertaken without any incident at all. The government absolutely condemns cruelty to animals and that's why we put in place a world-class— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

How many of the 335 aged-care recipients who have died from COVID-19 would be alive if the minister had acted upon previous reviews?</span>

One of the reasons we called the royal commission is that successive governments—and I think this has been also stated by the commissioners—have not acted as they perhaps could have done with respect to aged care. There is clearly work that needs to be done. So I don't seek to draw a correlation with those many reports into the aged-care sector that were done before I came to the portfolio. I don't seek to draw that correlation. I again offer my condolences to every single one of the families who lost a loved one through COVID-19. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I don't seek to draw that correlation. The royal commission has. I acknowledge that. But I don't seek to do that. What I do say is that, from the outset of this pandemic, this government, firstly through its public health response through the national health COVID-19 response plan and through its engagement with the aged-care sector, has worked continuously to provide advice to the sector on how they can mitigate the entry of COVID-19 into aged-care facilities and, if it does get into an aged-care facility, how to protect residents within facilities—and also the resources to do that. We will continue to do that. We have learnt a lot about this virus over the last 12 months. We will continue to learn, because there is still more to learn. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The national campaign Help is Here is a campaign that we launched in May this year. It's funded through the $150 million domestic violence package that was announced. This extra funding is absolutely directed at making sure that anybody who might be at risk of domestic violence knows what support is available to them and where they are able to get those services. The Help is Here campaign reaches Australians in a number of different ways: through the internet and, obviously, in their homes on the television, but most importantly in shopping centres and in magazines and newspapers, where people who may be at greater risk are often by themselves. The two main contact points are through the 1800RESPECT hotline and the dedicated MensLine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign uniquely reflects the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic by recognising that, during the pandemic, some people at risk of domestic violence may not be able to leave their house, apart from perhaps to go shopping. The Help is Here campaign aims to reach victims of domestic violence and abuse through signs in rest rooms in shopping centres, to make sure that they know where they can ring if they need to get some help or if they are finding themselves in difficult times. By directing people to the national hotlines and through the partnership networks that we have, we provide assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week so people can know that they can go online or onto the phone and speak to a trained counsellor from the particular initiatives that are being funded.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the private sector for coming on board with this particular initiative, the Help is Here campaign: Channel 7 and the major supermarket chains, as well as Amazon. I also acknowledge the work of the states and territories, to which we've provided $130 million to support them in their frontline service provision.</span>

That is really important, because increased awareness means that people will know automatically where they can get the support should they find themselves in need of it. As an example, in the middle of this year the 1800RESPECT hotline had received 86,000 contacts in the three-month period leading up to 30 July 2020. At the same time last year, they'd received around 55,000 calls in the same period—a significant increase. MensLine also indicated that they had received an increase in calls.</span>

We want to try and reach them by as many different means as possible—whether it be through the internet, through normal channels like television and radio, in shopping centres or through magazines and newspapers—because we want them to know that the two national hotlines are available to them. Most importantly—to make sure we reach out to people who don't speak English as their first language and to our Indigenous Australians—we want to make sure that our advice is provided in an appropriate way. So, for our vulnerable communities, the campaign materials have been tailored. For instance, in CALD communities we've translated our advertising materials into 14 different languages so that the audiences will be able to get access to the Help is Here information. We've also worked with Indigenous mentors and Indigenous domestic violence survivors to prepare for distribution appropriate material for news outlets and, specifically, the channels of distribution that they're most likely to use.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Epping Gardens—from the information that I've been given—had its first indication of an outbreak on 19 July. These are DHHS figures, which actually count contacts that are not part of the facility—they're not staff or residents. I indicated that I didn't think there were any with more than 100 residents in an outbreak. Epping Gardens in fact had 100 residents that were infected, it had 82 staff, and there are what DHHS classify as '29 other'. I don't know what the 'other' means at this point in time. That's a DHHS classification, which, through the Victorian aged-care recovery centre, we are working to properly define. We believe it means family members and other contacts of the infection at the facility.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Nothing worked well from the outbreak.' 'I thought we were prepared. Nothing prepared us for what was to come.' 'I couldn't believe this was happening in my country.' These are just some of the words from the Commonwealth's review into the Newmarch House COVID-19 outbreak, released today. That outbreak happened in April, some four months ago, and 19 older Australians died. Before that, there were warnings from overseas about the devastating impact of COVID on aged care. The alarm bells were ringing, but the Morrison government was not listening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's report on Newmarch House confirms, as do the answers we heard from Senator Colbeck, that the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senate Colbeck, and the Morrison government did not have a plan in place to manage the COVID outbreaks in aged care in Australia. As we heard in question time today, 335 aged-care recipients have passed away from COVID-19. There've been 1,761 COVID-19 cases in aged care. Each one of these numbers is a real person. It is somebody's mother or father; it is somebody's grandmother or grandfather; it is somebody's spouse or someone's life partner. These are some of Australia's most precious citizens. These are people who helped build the nation, who fought for it in several wars, who worked and built community, raised families and created jobs, who were part of their church or their local service organisations. And these older Australians are dying at home alone. They're dying in residential aged-care homes alone. They're lucky if they get to hold the hand of a staff member in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just imagine what kind of death we are talking about, because I sometimes think there is a perception that old people simply pass away, and perhaps that is a perception you could take from the lack of a response and the lack of a plan from the Morrison government. But old people don't just simply die. This is a highly contagious disease that attacked older Australians in residential aged care when there was not a plan in place to manage infection control, when there was not a plan in place to replace workforce when they got sick, when there was not a plan in place for protective equipment. And these older Australians, who are vulnerable to this disease, got sick, and they're dying alone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's understand what kind of death that is. I heard one of the adult children of a woman who died in St Basil's describe on radio that experience—of having to watch his mother's death at a distance, of not being able to hold her hand or touch her. Can you imagine being in the last moments of your life and not being able to touch your children? Can you imagine watching your mother or father die just feet from you—maybe through a window, through a mask—and not being able to hug them in the last moments of their existence? Can you imagine your husband or your wife on their deathbed, and you can't even hold their hand in comfort? That's what kind of death this is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not be surprised that our aged-care homes were unable to cope with this, because, if you look at the interim report handed down by the royal commission into aged care, that report called it 'neglect'. It's not called 'compassionate care', it's not called 'preparedness', it's not called 'living with dignity in your old age'; it is called 'neglect'. It talks about our senior citizens—our mums and dads, our grandparents and aunts and uncles—being in aged-care homes with open sores and physical abuse and malnourishment. It talks about a lack of infection control, whether we're talking about diarrhoea or COVID-19.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to pay tribute right here to the aged-care frontline workers. I have met many of them. I've met them, and they're in tears, some of them, because they know they don't have the time or the resources or the support to give the care that they know that their residents need. And they're distressed too; they're on the front line of this outbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we have a minister who hasn't engaged fully enough with this crisis in aged care, from the handing down of a report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect </span>through to last Friday, when he didn't know the answers to basic questions through to question time today—we need a plan and we need it today; we needed it yesterday, we need it tomorrow, we need it right now, to look after our senior citizens in aged care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  No-one could help but be moved, thinking about how difficult it must be to be someone facing the end of their lives and unable to be with their families, unable to have the comfort and support of the people with whom they have travelled the journey of life. I can speak from experience. Early on during the aged-care impacts of COVID-19 I lost my grandfather, and it was very difficult not to be able to be with him in the last moments of his life. He's a man I loved. He immigrated to this country from Austria. He built a life here. He came with very few skills. He was a person who worked in the textile factories at the time he immigrated, and by the time he finished his career he was a foreman at Kimberly-Clark, making the nappies that I suspect my children wore for the many years they were small. And he was a thoroughly good man. But he died alone. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of the criticisms that are being levelled by those opposite are in a logical sense truly connected to my experience of loss or to the experience of loss that many other Australians have undergone in recent times, as we have all as a nation had to adapt to the difficulty of the restrictions that come with COVID-19. It's hard even now for people with a loved one in aged care not to be able to give them the usual support and care they ordinarily would give with love as an expression of gratitude for the many gifts that the older person has given throughout the course of their life. It remains difficult, but it's also reflective of the collective sacrifices Australians from all walks of life are making as we attempt to get under control a virus that is ravaging the world. It's ravaging people's health, it's ravaging our economy and it's having knock-on consequences for communities everywhere.</span>

We can't allow this kind of misinformation to stand. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth is on the record with this. He says that allegations that the government lacked urgency when helping aged-care homes to battle coronavirus are insulting. That's what you're doing: you're insulting the aged-care workers who have tried so hard to adapt to the challenge of this time. Similarly, he has said:</span>

It is very easy to throw political arrows over this side and try and claim a scalp or two, or try and string up a minister to blame, but ultimately this is the nature of the virus. We are doing everything that can possibly be done to get it under control so that people in our community, people like my family, don't have to experience the death of a loved one alone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  There are four failed ministers in this third-term Liberal government. The first appointment was the former senator Mitch Fifield, who had no interest at all in aged care. Then we had Sussan Ley, who is back in the ministry, who had no interest in aged care. Then we had Minister Ken Wyatt, who had no capacity to deliver anything in terms of reform of the aged-care sector. Now we have Senator Colbeck—what an embarrassment for this government. Aged care was always going to be in trouble when this virus hit this country. There is nothing new there, because this government has not had a minister that was interested enough to make sure there were plans in place. This didn't suddenly hit Australia before anywhere else. This pandemic was known. We already knew because we'd had 14 reports into the aged-care sector during the terms of this government, telling each and every one of them the problems that we had through lack of resources, lack of training, lack of staff and lack of money. When he was Treasurer, this Prime Minister ripped $1 billion out of the aged-care sector. He used the aged-care sector as an ATM. No wonder the sector couldn't cope when COVID-19 hit. There are fantastic staff and good providers in this sector, and I take my hat off to them each and every day when they are doing the best that they can.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister made a commitment after the last election that he was going to make aged care a priority. He is accountable and he must be held responsible for the issues and the crisis in the aged-care sector now. But we know the Prime Minister doesn't want any accountability. He certainly doesn't want any transparency. He is standing by his man. This minister has failed older Australians miserably. Even today in the chamber he still couldn't get the figure right. He still couldn't get the figure correct. He said 385 older Australians had died. The figure is 335. We understand that he is a minister under pressure. But older Australians and their families deserve so much more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When COVID-19 hit our shores we knew that older Australians would be some of the most vulnerable in the community to be susceptible to this virus. The aged-care sector was already in crisis. This is a government who called a royal commission into its own failings. They already knew that the sector was in crisis and they did nothing about it. To have a junior minister being responsible for the aged-care sector is unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were last in government—and bearing in mind this is the third term of this government—we held aged care in the priority that it should be by having a cabinet minister. We have been calling on each and every Liberal government since then to elevate aged care into the cabinet but they have failed to do that. What they have done is used it as a cash cow and ripped $1 billion out—by the Prime Minister when he held the portfolio of Treasury. We know they have been underfunding it. We know that there have been in excess of 14 reports since they have come to government and each and every one of those has given us the warnings. There are red lights flashing all the time. There are not enough staff and not enough resources. Money is being ripped out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to be regulated. We need to have national training. We need to ensure that there is uniformity across this country. We have been told time and time again. They must have realised there were some issues when they called the royal commission. We have had the interim report and what have we seen? No real action from the government. What they want to do is use that royal commission as an excuse. The Australian people are not going to accept it. One of the good things about calling this royal commission was it got the media and the Australian people interested. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to step up and act. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  I know one of those 335 who have now passed away in residential aged-care facilities. My great-auntie Edie passed away in New South Wales. She did not deserve to go the way she did, but she did, like another 334. My thoughts and prayers are with every single family who has lost someone in these circumstances, whether in an aged-care facility or otherwise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would first like to compliment the minister on facing the dogged questioning from the opposition over the course of question time. Every single opposition question was put to the minister during the course of question time and he faithfully gave answers to each and every question. He started his answer to the first question by noting his deep regret that last Friday he was not able to provide the figures which had been asked for. I have no doubt, knowing the minister as I do, that that apology was heartfelt, sincere and genuine, and it was given with great dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those listening to this debate would be excused for thinking that all of the responsibility with respect to aged care falls at the minister's feet. The answer is very, very different. I refer to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreaks in Residential Care national guidelines which were adopted under the auspices of the Communicable Diseases Network Australia. That document sets out the actual responsibilities for each of the stakeholders in aged care. I just want to give a summary of those responsibilities, because if you were listening to this debate you would think the sole person responsible is Mr Colbeck, and that is simply untrue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, under the heading 'Residential Care Facilities', the guidelines state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The primary responsibility of managing COVID-19 outbreaks lies with the RCF—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the residential care facilities—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">in their responsibility for resident care and infection control. All RCF should have access to infection control expertise, whether in-house or not, and outbreak management plans in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat those words: the primary responsibility of managing COVID-19 outbreaks lies with the residential care facilities. These are guidelines that were accepted by the entire industry. These are the industry's guidelines. The primary responsibility lies with the residential care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, next, under the heading 'The State/Territory Department of Health', the guidelines state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">State/territory public health section in the Departments of Health will act in an advisory role to assist RCF to detect, characterise and manage COVID-19 outbreaks. This includes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">assisting facilities to confirm outbreaks</span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">providing advice on obtaining testing samples</span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">providing guidance on outbreak management</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so it goes on. Those were the responsibilities of the state and territory departments of health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to the Australian Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. It's responsibility is as the national regulator of aged-care services. Then there's the Australian government's Department of Health. The guidelines state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACF) that receive funding from the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth will work collaboratively with the overall management of the response to support the viability and capacity of the RACF to access services …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth government, under the leadership of the minister, Minister Colbeck, has been doing exactly that. It has provided an additional $1 billion in funding. Just as recently as last Friday it provided an additional $171 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the roles and responsibilities of each of the players and stakeholders in aged-care facilities. That was the observation also in the independent review that was released today, the final report, dated 20 August 2020, into the Newmarch House COVID-19 outbreak. That responsibility of the residential care facilities was front and centre in that report. Appendix I contained a summary of key learnings numbered 1 through to 20. Those are 20 key learnings covering a diverse range of subjects. It is simply disingenuous and quite reprehensible in some respects, in the circumstances, to try to apportion all the blame to Minister Colbeck. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  This government has left vulnerable older Australians at risk and exposed to a deadly virus. But first, because we are talking about real people here, not numbers in daily reports, let me acknowledge the sad news that we're hearing out of Victoria about the significant number of deaths in aged-care facilities. Our thoughts must be with every single person who has lost a loved one during this pandemic, particularly those families who have loved ones in aged-care facilities, some who are deeply worried and not getting news in a timely manner the way that they should. And we know that it's been an incredibly difficult few weeks for some of those families and their loved ones in some of these aged-care facilities, particularly in Victoria. These are some of the most vulnerable Australians, and they deserve a government with a plan to keep them safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the warning bells were ringing in March but nobody in the government was listening. We know that 335 residents have passed away and there are more than 1,300 active cases, and yet the minister and the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, continue—and we heard it again just a moment ago in the contribution from the senator opposite—to pass the buck and the blame. It has been a disgraceful exercise to witness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is in charge of aged care. The Morrison government regulates aged care. It funds aged care. The Morrison government has the legislation that determines the quality of aged care that older Australians get. If things are not working, if systems are not working, the Morrison government is ultimately responsible for this. The buck stops with Scott Morrison and with this minister, this man who does not seem to have any kind of real grasp of what his job actually is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw just last Friday that Minister Colbeck couldn't even answer basic questions when questioned at the Select Committee on COVID-19 inquiry into the Australian government's response to the pandemic. The Australian public was genuinely stunned that he was not across the most basic and tragic facts. And his performance in this place today has done absolutely nothing to give Australians confidence that he knows what his job is or that he has the capacity to lead and to assert the right that these Australians have to quality care, to protection from infection from a deadly pandemic, to communication with their families and loved ones, and to be cared for by a workforce that is adequately trained, has secure work, is adequately paid and goes to work each day in conditions that are safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for Scott Morrison and his Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians to be honest. They knew aged-care facilities would struggle to find staff during a coronavirus outbreak, but they did nothing. They knew about the potential for a withdrawal of staff at an aged-care home because of coronavirus, but they did not do enough to prepare for this. Scott Morrison said on 29 July that the events that have tragically occurred in Victorian aged-care homes could not have been anticipated or foreshadowed, but his government was repeatedly warned that they could happen. It happened at Earle Haven over a year ago. It happened at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House months ago. We stand in this chamber today with still no answer to the question: why did Scott Morrison and his minister not have—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator URQUHART:</span>
                  </a>  Apologies. Why did the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and this minister not have a proper plan to deal with the loss of workforce in aged-care homes?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also, tragically, clear that the Morrison government's surge workforce has been inadequate to deal with outbreaks of coronavirus. We also found out that the Morrison government has spent just half of the money that it set aside for a surge workforce that was meant to assist aged-care homes impacted by coronavirus. This is completely unacceptable. The minister says that we're still learning and we're in discussions. He seems utterly incapable of the leadership required to acknowledge the damage this government has wrought in our aged-care sector and how a pandemic has served to reveal, deepen and shatter the structural cracks that were already undermining it, yet Mr Morrison says he has full confidence in this incompetent minister. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians (Senator Colbeck) to a question without notice asked by Senator Siewert today relating to COVID-19 and aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the minister talking as if, just because other countries had had outbreaks of COVID in residential aged care, it was inevitable that it would happen here. It wasn't inevitable, and it shouldn't have been inevitable that it happen here if we had a system that was set up to actually function properly. The fact is that we have had 35 reports over the last 40 years—nearly one report a year—into the failures in aged care and how it should be fixed. Despite the minister saying, 'The other countries are worse,' the fact is that, according to the royal commission into aged care—the very royal commission that this government called—Australia has one of the highest rates in the world of residential aged-care deaths as a proportion of deaths from COVID-19. That is quite shocking. That is quite shocking to the families that have lost loved ones in residential aged care during this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years and years, people who know what they're talking about have been calling for reform in aged care and, in particular, for significant investment of resources. Today we saw that Professor Pollaers has said that we need an investment of at least $3.5 billion into residential aged care. And what we heard from the minister in answer to my questions was that we've got to wait for the royal commission. The fact is that these things are happening right now. We have insufficient workforce right now. We have insufficient practices right now. We are not seeing clinical care addressed. Just last year I tabled in this place the Community Affairs References Committee report into aged care, which had a particular focus on clinical care and which highlighted the problems with clinical care being provided in residential aged-care facilities. I maintain that, if we had started addressing those clinical care issues, that's one of the things that we wouldn't need to address so much now, because we would have those things in place and could have dealt with infectious disease control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are still not providing all workers in residential aged care with, and we are still seeing that not all workers have completed, the most up-to-date infectious disease control. How can this be happening in this country? Why haven't we been investing the money in our workforce that so many reports have so clearly shown that we need to invest? We need to significantly invest in our aged-care workforce so that we're providing the level of care—four hours and 18 minutes per day—that it is recommended that we provide. Why aren't we doing that urgently across this country, so that we don't see the tragedy that has been unfolding in Victoria happen anywhere else?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Heaven forbid there should be an outbreak of COVID somewhere else. Unless we are making sure that every residential aged-care facility has actually been audited, we cannot assure the Australian public that people living in residential aged care are safe. What did the our regulator of aged care, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, do? They sent out a form for self-assessment by these residences, and people out there may now be shocked to learn that most of those residential facilities said, 'Yes, we're prepared.' Those in Victoria said, 'Yes, we are prepared,' and yet look at the tragedy we are seeing unfold in Victoria. It shows very clearly that we need a much more heavy-handed approach—and I hate to say it, but we do—to the regulation of aged care in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to beef up our Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. At the moment, they only have an additional 13 staff. That is nowhere near enough to deal with the issues that we need to be dealing with. This country expected that our residential aged-care facilities would keep people's loved ones safe—would keep our older Australians safe—but they have failed enormously. What we are seeing in Victoria could roll out anywhere else in the country unless we step up our workforce in all residential aged-care facilities and we make sure all our workers are supported—that they don't have to go begging for additional support. These things are urgent. They can't wait until the royal commission reports. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 17 July 2020, of Dominic John Foreman, former senator for South Australia, places on record its gratitude for his service to the Parliament and the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic Foreman came into the Senate in October 1980 as a strong voice and dedicated advocate for workers rights, particularly for those in the manufacturing industries. He was a true blue-collar worker who spent much of his early working life in the automotive industry, first as an apprentice on the factory floor and then as a union official. He rose through the ranks of the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation of Australia to eventually serve as its president. Like so many on the other side of this chamber, Dominic worked within the trade union movement for many years before entering politics. He will be remembered for his dedication and passion for the automotive industry, his long and distinguished service to both the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party and his commitments to those he represented—the people of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born on 6 August 1933 to George and Gertrude Foreman in the mid-north country town of Clare in South Australia, Dominic Foreman grew up on the family's vineyard as one of six children. Leaving school at 13, Dominic spent two years working in the family cafe on the main street of Clare before moving to Adelaide to work for whitegoods manufacturer Simpson. In 1954, he joined General Motors Holden, working as a welder on an assembly line at both the Woodville plant and the Elizabeth plant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a year with General Motors Holden, Dominic Foreman joined the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation, becoming a shop steward. He spent the next 15 years working through the ranks of the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation, serving as both its state secretary and eventually, in 1979, becoming its Australian president. During his service as the Australian president of the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation, Dominic Foreman also served as president of the South Australian trades and labour council and as state president of the ALP in South Australia. Clearly, this was a very busy period in Dominic Foreman's life, but he still wanted to do more for his state—specifically for those working in the automotive industry. Less than 12 months later, he would get his opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1980, then senator Reg Bishop, a former minister in the Whitlam government, indicated his intention to retire. With the support of his close friend and federal member for Port Adelaide Mick Young, Dominic Foreman contested the Senate preselection, securing first position on the ALP Senate ticket—a feat within itself for a first-time Senate candidate. He was elected on the first count and remained in a strong position on the ALP ticket in South Australia in subsequent elections in 1983, 1987 and 1993.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech he highlighted the importance of the car industry in Australia, especially in his home state of South Australia. Dominic Foreman was passionate about workers rights, industrial relations and upskilling Australia's youth to prevent unemployment. He was especially vocal in relation to the needs of young people in rural areas, recognising how important it is for young Australians to get a decent education. During his parliamentary service Dominic Foreman retained his strong commitment to the automotive industry and to representing the rights of young workers. He ensured that he was always there as a strong voice whenever there was a motor industry issue on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note and reflect on his long and distinguished service to the Australian Labor Party. Dominic Foreman joined the ALP in South Australia in the early 1950s. He served on Labor's state executive in South Australia from 1975 to 1981 and in 1979 was elected state president, serving for one year before entering this chamber as a senator for South Australia. By all accounts, even after leaving the Senate in 1997, he remained a vocal supporter and committed member of the Australian Labor Party. During his 16 years in parliament, Dominic Foreman served on a number of Senate committees. But he is probably best remembered for his service in the Senate as both a government and an opposition deputy whip. For over a decade he served as a deputy whip, a role he thoroughly enjoyed and in which he performed extremely well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1997 Dominic Foreman was forced to retire from parliament due to ill health. It is clear that he was highly regarded, trusted and respected on both sides of politics. He was reliable and served this parliament with loyalty, devotion and integrity. Family was important to Dominic Foreman, as it is to all of us here. He was a loved and cherished father, grandfather and great-grandfather. It is to his family, on behalf of the Australian government and the Senate, that I offer our deepest condolences. Dominic Foreman will be remembered for his long service to the Australian Labor Party, his commitment to and love of the automotive industry and his dedication to serving the interests of Australian workers and their families.</span>

                  <a href="I0N" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I thank Senator Wong for allowing me to start the contribution of the Labor Party on this condolence motion regarding former Senator Dominic Foreman. Dominic John Foreman died on 17 July 2020. Dominic was possibly one of the last blue collar workers who toiled his way up through the trade union movement to be a shop steward and organiser and secretary of the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation of Australia, being almost one of the last of the blue collar workers to represent Labor in either house of the federal parliament or even the state parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic John Foreman was born in Clare on 6 August 1933. He had one brother and four sisters. As a young man Dominic worked in the family restaurant in Clare, but he was eventually educated at Rostrevor College, which was a considerable expense for his family at that time. However, Dominic was grateful for this. Dominic went on to work as a welder. He worked at General Motors Holden and at the old Woodville plant that has long since gone—now a Bunnings store, if I'm correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic became a member of the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation and was an active trade unionist, being a shop steward. He represented the union to the membership and slowly but surely worked his way up through the trade union movement. It was during this period, in 1976, that I first met Dominic. I was a young trade unionist myself and we would meet after meetings of the trades and labour council in the basement of the old Trades Hall in South Terrace. My first impression of Dominic was of a quiet and humble man, and that impression never changed throughout all of the years that I knew him subsequent to that. Eventually, he was an organiser with the VBEF and, from that time, became the state secretary of that organisation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic was a lifelong trade unionist and through that became an active member of the Australian Labor Party. He made friends with a large number of other trade unionists, but mainly ones of blue-collar origin, of that particular generation, one of whom was the late Mick Young. Dominic was always seen as part of Mick's gang, and the two were inseparable until Mick's death in 1996. Dominic was convinced by Mick that he should seek a parliamentary career and he was seriously considering the seat of Bonython, which was going to be vacated by the then member, Martin Nicholls, in 1977. However, Mick Young prevailed upon Dominic to put his plans on hold so that Neal Blewett, then a professor at Flinders University, could take the seat. Blewett was seen as a prize catch for the Labor Party, and he would go on to be the architect of Medicare and other things within the Labor Party. Dominic was happy to stand aside in the interests of the Labor Party and the labour movement as a whole. He eventually was preselected No. 1 on the ticket for the 1980 federal election to be a senator for South Australia, and was duly elected, although he didn't take up his seat until July 1981. He would then go on to be a federal senator until 1997. Dominic resigned his position in 1997 when the Labor Party preselected John Quirke to fill the vacancy. Quirke was then a state member of the South Australian parliament and previously had worked for Dominic as a staffer and a speechwriter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate Dominic held a number of positions, including chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works and the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and other committee positions. Dominic was a very good committee performer, and many projects in Australia would go through that rapid scrutiny and reporting process under his watchful eye. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic was married to Maggie and they had two children, Luke and Lindy. In turn, Luke and Lindy would provide many grandchildren and, now, great-grandchildren, all of whom mourn the passing of Dominic. Dominic married Shirley in 1986 and they had a happy life together until Shirley's passing in April 2007. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic's parliamentary career was not without its ups and downs. There was a serious attempt to deselect him in 1992 and give the seat to another sitting senator. The problem for the Labor Party was that at the next election, due in 1993, there would be three sitting senators, with the prospect of returning only two to Canberra. Dominic faced the combined opposition of certain sections of the ALP—the then South Australian Premier, John Bannon, the former Premier, Don Dunstan, and others who were friendly to the other particular senator—who were seeking to replace Dominic up the ticket. On 2 February 1992, Dominic Foreman stared down the opposition and won the ballot three to one. He would go on to serve in the Senate until 1997.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic was a lifelong fan of Australian Rules football. He played with that great South Australian team West Adelaide, of which I'm also a member. He would have gone on to play serious league football—he was in my Uncle Joe Heptinstall's generation at West Adelaide—but he was concerned that if he was injured his young family would have to survive without a breadwinner. However, this did not stop Dominic from being a strong supporter of Westies through thick and thin, and through the very many years that they were in the wilderness. One of his Port Adelaide supporters makes this claim about him, which I have been unable to verify but which I will repeat: they say he was an initial supporter of the Adelaide Crows but he changed his allegiance to the Port Adelaide Power because he believed it represented more of his trade union, working-class origins. I don't personally believe that myself, but I'm told this is true. The passing of Dominic represents almost the end of the blue-collar era within the Australian Labor Party. Dominic went from the tools on the floor through various levels of the trade union movement into parliament to represent the working people of South Australia.</span>

The horror of COVID-19 has been made manifest inside Australia's aged-care facilities. Older Australians have died alone, before their time and without loved ones. Staff have faced illness without the safety of protective equipment. Families have lost the chance to say goodbye.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister cannot control a pandemic or a global economic downturn, but he and his government are responsible for the federally funded aged-care sector, and more should have been done. The neglect and negligence we have seen through the COVID-19 period is a continuation of the neglect and negligence that has been brought to the fore through the proceedings of the aged-care royal commission. Older Australians deserve better than this. The government has squandered three terms worth of opportunities to fix the aged-care sector. The problems have been known for some time. There have been countless reports over the last six years, most of which have been ignored. The failure to act on these recommendations has helped exacerbate the current situation. I note, Madam Acting Deputy President Fierravanti-Wells, that you made a damning submission to the aged-care royal commission, stating:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In short, Prime Minister Abbott and those advising him in the Coalition failed in their promise to reform aged care and simply opted for a shift that had no demonstrable positive outcome for the wellbeing of our older Australians. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very clear statement of the problem. Moving the deckchairs didn't help at all. She's not alone in thinking that this is so. The commissioners presiding over the aged-care royal commission said today:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Had the Australian government acted on previous reviews of aged care, the persistent problems in aged care would have been known much earlier and the suffering of many people could have been avoided. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During question time today, the minister for aged care, Senator Colbeck, said that he didn't seek to draw a connection between the failure to act on previous reviews and the problems being experienced now. I think he should explain what he means by that. Is the minister seriously suggesting that there is no link? What does that mean for the observations being made by the commissioners that preside over the aged-care royal commission? Is he rejecting the conclusions of the commissioners—commissioners tasked, by his own account, with sorting through the challenges in the sector. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure to act on problems in this sector is not just historical. It has continued into the COVID period. Since Mr Morrison has become Prime Minister, another report has been delivered, a report by Professor Pollaers, the chair of the government's Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce. That has been sitting on the minister's desk for two years. It has 14 recommendations. Only one of those has been implemented and that one only partially. All the government has done is establish a committee. Lethargy, indifference and a failure to learn from the mistakes of the past have characterised the government's approach to the aged-care sector during COVID. It took until last Friday—six months into the pandemic—after hundreds of aged-care residents died—for the government to announce an aged-care advisory group. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a clear failure to plan. Counsel assisting the aged-care royal commission said that neither the Commonwealth department of health nor the aged-care regulator developed a COVID-19 plan specifically for the aged-care sector. It's incredible. It is incredible that such a plan would not have been developed, when everybody knew from the very beginnings of the outbreak of this pandemic that older people were the most vulnerable and the most likely to face mortality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report from Newmarch House was released today. Issue after issue identified in that report as contributing to the tragic outbreak at Newmarch House was not addressed by the Morrison government in the critical weeks before COVID-19 hit Victorian aged-care homes. For example, the report notes the impact of severely depleted staffing because of COVID-19 infections among staff—and quarantine—and the significant challenge this posed to Newmarch House. Despite this, the PM and the minister for aged care have continued to say that this issue could not have been anticipated in Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it could have been anticipated, because we'd seen it once before in New South Wales. The royal commission was told that Dorothy Henderson Lodge lost almost its entire workforce within the first 48 hours. Within a week of the outbreak at Newmarch House, it had lost 87 per cent of its existing workforce. The report on Newmarch House calls for an expansion of surge capacities. But just last week it was revealed that even now the Morrison government has only spent half the funding it committed to addressing that problem. The report also notes that infection prevention and control was a significant concern, but in the critical weeks before the Victorian outbreak the Morrison government did no audit of nursing home stock of PPE, despite more than 1,300 providers requesting access to the National Medical Stockpile. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these failures have had a cost. The minister for aged care may not have remembered the number of people who have died in aged-care facilities from COVID-19. But the families and loved ones of those 313 older Australians will. Older Australians have borne the majority of the health consequences of this virus. Australia is recording one of the highest rates in the world of residential aged-care deaths as a proportion of deaths from the coronavirus. Almost 2,000 cases have been recorded in facilities. Staff have been left to work in understaffed and under-resourced Melbourne aged-care facilities. One doctor said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Tonight, I worked with three nurses who were all in tears at one stage or another … At times, we're significantly distressed and exasperated at the circumstances in which we've found ourselves, where we are unable to provide the optimal care that we sought for a multitude of reasons.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's failure to take responsibility, to acknowledge the role of his government in resolving this problem and to provide the answers the public deserves has simply compounded the hurt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As one grieving son told <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> newspaper:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm not grieving because an 84-year-old woman died, necessarily. It's painful, we miss our mum, but we have been in pain for years … For us, it was painful because there are no answers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister needs to provide answers to these families. But, more importantly, he needs to take urgent steps to ensure that unnecessary deaths, unnecessary illness and unnecessary anxiety and stress for families of people with loved ones in aged care do not occur again. Australians who have tragically been let down by Mr Morrison and his minister for aged care deserve no less. The public needs to know that Mr Morrison has learnt from previous outbreaks and everything possible is now being done. Former US Vice-President, Hubert Humphrey. once said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in shadows of life, the sick …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise today to speak on the matter of urgency regarding aged care raised by Senator Keneally. I noted with sadness Senator Colbeck's advice earlier today that there have been 335 COVID-19 related deaths in aged care. I offer my sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of these 335 people who have lost their lives. Just 12 months ago my mother was in an aged-care facility in Launceston. I was fortunate to be able to visit her frequently in her final months. While I understand how hard it is to have a loved one in care, I cannot fathom how difficult it must be for those who cannot see their mothers, their fathers, their grandfathers, their grandmothers, their aunts or their uncles because of the COVID-19 restrictions. That is a heartbreaking scenario. I also want to extend my sympathies to the Australians who are living with COVID-19, or who are currently in isolation due to the impact of COVID-19 on their communities. It is a difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard earlier today, the total number of active COVID-19 cases in the aged-care sector nationally stands at 1,761 residents, including residential and in-home care. There are currently 126 aged-care services with active cases. This government is determined to ensure that a safe environment exists in aged-care facilities. As we all work together to contain the spread of COVID-19, there is no doubt that we are facing an extraordinary health challenge in containing this virus. We must work together to protect our most vulnerable people against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Richard Colbeck, have made supporting aged-care facilities to contain coronavirus their prime focus. The safety and wellbeing of aged-care residents is our No. 1 focus. Where there have been large clusters of community transmission it has been very hard to keep COVID-19 out of aged-care services. This, sadly, is what has happened in Victoria. Once the virus got into these facilities the results were devastating, despite the efforts of staff in those facilities to adhere to the required infection controls and screening programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working hard to contain this virus. All Victorian aged-care facilities with active COVID-19 cases are receiving support from both the Australian Department of Health and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission to ensure residents continue to receive essential care. This support includes a single case manager for each facility, access to PPE, testing in the facilities themselves and access to additional staff as needed. In addition, as we heard from the Minister for Defence during question time today, AUSMAT has been deployed to Victoria to assist with managing the COVID-19 response and ADF personnel are on site in some residential facilities, with additional clinical reserve staff available should they be needed. The ADF supported our health staff when there was a coronavirus outbreak in Tasmania's north-west earlier this year, for which we as a state are so grateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health staff from Tasmania have put up their hands to help Victoria in this time of need, as have staff from Western Australia, the ACT and Queensland. Contact-tracing staff have been brought in from New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland to assist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has scaled up aged-care support programs in Victoria and across Australia, recently committing an extra $171 million to boost the COVID-19 response plan in aged care. This brings the total of Commonwealth funding for the aged-care sector to more than $1 billion since this pandemic began. Infection control training programs, surge workforce staff and additional compliance by the aged-care commissioner and coordinated response centres will all benefit from this extra funding. The funding will provide $81 million for an additional surge workforce and increased training for aged-care workers; $8.4 million for supplementary payments to include quarantine costs and interstate staff; $50 million to account for additional demand for retention bonus measures; $9.1 million for the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre—established with the Victorian government to boost their additional workforce while undergoing more training—to ensure a workforce that can quickly respond to outbreaks in other states; $12.5 million to support aged-care residents and their families who have experienced a COVID-19 outbreak with grief and trauma support services; and more Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission compliance and quality checks on aged-care providers, specifically checking on preparations and responses to COVID-19 outbreaks. Other funding measures include $205 million to help residential aged-care providers meet costs associated with COVID-19 and almost $48 million to extend the Business Improvement Fund for another year to help residential aged-care providers in financial difficulty. Regional, rural and remote areas and those affected by bushfires have been prioritised for fund applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also putting more funding into helping older Australians stay at home, including $59 million for meal delivery services like Meals on Wheels and $10 million for the Community Visitors Scheme to ensure those in aged care are not socially isolated due to visiting restrictions. Indigenous elders living in urban areas are also being supported with transport to medical appointments, welfare checks, meals and other measures to lessen the impact of isolation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Keneally claims the Morrison government failed to plan to protect older Australians in aged care, but I would argue that this government has been preparing and planning its response to COVID-19 in residential aged care since January this year. We have been working with the aged-care sector and state and territory governments to build a strong but flexible response to this virus, incorporating lessons from our own successes and those of other countries as we go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Specific guidelines for COVID-19 were issued by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia to the aged-care sector on 13 March and have been updated twice since. These guidelines and response plan include infection control guidance designed specifically for residential aged care; COVID-19 training for the aged-care workforce; visitation restrictions that keep residents safe but are also mindful of the need for those residents to remain safely connected to their families and communities; rapid provision of PPE, clinical expertise and an additional skilled workforce to support care and contain transmission in the event of an outbreak; and COVID-19 pathology testing and access to telehealth to ensure residents continue to safely receive needed health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is delivering record investment across the aged-care system, with an estimated $25.4 billion forecast for 2022-23. By comparison, Labor's investment in aged care in 2012-13 was $13.3 billion. On average, that is an extra $1.2 billion in support for older Australians over the forward estimates each year. Making improvements to aged care for all senior Australians continues to be one of this government's key priorities. That is why the Prime Minister called a Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. We're committed to providing senior Australians with support to live in their own homes for longer. New home-care packages have increased from just over 60,000 under Labor in 2012-13 to more than 164,000 in 2022-23. This is an increase of more than 170 per cent. Over that same period, funding will have increased by 258 per cent due to growth in high-level packages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The viability supplement to support services in rural and remote Australia has been increased by 30 per cent, as has the homeless supplement. This government has also established a new independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, implemented new consumer focused Aged Care Quality Standards and the Aged Care Diversity Framework, introduced a new mandatory national quality indicator program and put in place a new single Charter of Aged Care Rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just about investing in a COVID-19 response, more aged-care places and improving the framework around compliance within the aged-care sector. This government has invested $185 million to support the Medical Research Future Fund, with a focused mission on ageing, aged care and dementia. This fund will support older Australians to maintain their health and quality of life as they age so that they can live independently for longer and access quality care when they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reduction in risk, prevention and tracking of dementia will benefit from $21 million of investment in 13 research projects. Dementia is Australia's second-leading cause of death and something we are taking seriously. To this end we have established the Specialist Dementia Care Program and provided more funding to support dementia behaviour management through advisory services and training for care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More funding has also been provided for aged-care services for First Nations people, including grants for aged-care providers delivering services to Indigenous people to help purchase equipment and undertake minor works, and $60 million has been allocated for capital grants for infrastructure works in rural and remote areas. This government takes aged care seriously and it will always protect older Australians.</span>

We strongly support this motion. It is clear to us that the government does not have a coordinated, well-resourced national plan in place to protect older Australians from future COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care. Before I go any further I would also like to extend my condolences, sympathy and support for all of those Australians who have lost loved family members in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just heard a list of the things that the government says it has done in aged care, but clearly it is not enough because we have lost 335 older Australians in residential care and home care during this latest outbreak of COVID-19 in Victoria. It is clearly not enough. This government has failed to take accountability and, in doing so, failed older Australians and their families. It has apparently come as a surprise to the Prime Minister and the minister that aged care is in fact a responsibility of the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government is the primary funder and regulator of the aged-care system. The Department of Health is responsible for the operation of the Aged Care Act and the associated aged-care principles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I would like to focus on how we could have avoided the scale and heartbreak of the COVID-19 outbreaks in residential aged care and what we need to be doing to make sure it doesn't happen elsewhere. Today the minister said that the government is looking at the learnings from the Newmarch House outbreak, but the changes being made—for example, relating to early identification of cases, facility management and surge workforce—are all reactive. While those are very important, of course, the government is not taking seriously enough the prevention of outbreaks in aged-care facilities on a national level. They must start putting in place preventative measures now. They can't wait until after the royal commission has reported, because this is happening now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, at the Senate inquiry into COVID-19, the minister tried to pin problems in Victoria on the depletion of the workforce and on not appreciating that a whole workforce would have to be moved. I strongly believe that that was flawed thinking, given the circumstances we are seeing. But I also believe that if we had had the adequate number of staff and proper staff ratios and if we had had good clinical care measures in place in aged care we would not have seen issues on the scale that we now do. For years and years workers in aged care, some of the providers, and friends, families and loved ones of people in residential aged care have been raising the issue of workforce. For years we have known that we needed to significantly increase the numbers of workers, both nurses and care workers, in aged care. We've known for a long time that we needed to significantly improve the training and support for the workforce.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise today, amidst the greatest public health crisis in several generations, to speak to the matter of urgency. As of yesterday, 335 Australian families had lost a loved one to COVID-19 in aged care in Australia. So many Australians have been failed by a Commonwealth government that failed to prepare and that failed to learn the lessons from overseas and from outbreaks like those at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House. Those nursing homes, both in my home state of New South Wales, needed special planning and care as the virus bore down on us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While most of these victims of COVID-19 could not be with their loved ones, they did have tireless and selfless people by their side. I am talking of the 165,000 health workers in aged care who do the overwhelming majority of the work in our aged-care homes and services. They are kind and patient people who feed our loved ones, keep them hydrated, turn them, bathe them and lift them so that they are comfortable and safe. They share their stories and quell their fears, and they take them outside for a precious hour of sunshine. I cannot say enough to applaud the hard work that they endeavour to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure of how we value aged care in this country has no more important indicator than how we value the health workers, who are the care. Like truck drivers, cleaners, and food delivery, postal and supermarket workers, healthcare workers in aged care are the front line of this pandemic. They are the quiet heroes. We dishonour them, and we dishonour the older Australians they care for every day, when we pay them so little, when we deny them paid pandemic leave and when we condemn them to such insecure and unfunded work. They deserve better than this, and we can do better than this. The COVID-19 pandemic pulled back the curtain on the lack of funding and on job insecurity in aged care that were already there. Years before COVID-19, unions had been warning about the staff cuts and the underfunding of aged care. We should not be surprised that the pandemic took advantage of the systemic running down of staff levels and training. If Scott Morrison and his hapless aged-care minister care to actually address the crisis in aged care, I invite them to listen to the aged-care workers themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care is complex and the long-term decline in funding and the lack of transparency and accountability in how $13 billion of taxpayers' money is spent will not be solved overnight. But there are some important steps that workers in aged care know the government could and should take right now to address this crisis in aged care. Every worker needs paid pandemic leave. Every worker needs proper personal protective equipment and training in how to use it. And we need a trained and ready surge workforce. Every worker in the health and aged-care sectors needs access to paid pandemic leave—because the virus does not care what kind of job you do or where you do it—regardless of where they work and what state they are in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU and unions like the Health Services Union, which covers healthcare workers, have been calling for universal paid pandemic leave. Many have trumpeted the Fair Work Commission's recent decision to adjust the award, granting paid pandemic leave for aged-care workers. This is welcome news, but the problem is that only one in 10 workers in aged care are covered by that award. That means 90 per cent of aged-care workers who are covered by enterprise agreements may not be getting paid pandemic leave at all. Unless you are an aged-care worker in Victoria, you are facing the prospect of losing your income or losing your job if you have to self-isolate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health Services Union wrote to aged-care providers around the country to ask them do the right thing and offer paid pandemic leave to their staff. Here are the results. Some employers have agreed to pass on the full two weeks, like Twilight Aged Care to its 240 staff. Some employers, like UnitingCare, are paying only a few days, and the vast majority are determined to do nothing. Why won't the not-for-profit aged-care chains, like Whiddon and Mercy Health, offer paid pandemic lead to their staff? Why are for-profit aged-care operators, like Regis, effectively telling their staff that they must choose between safety, and paying their bills and feeding their kids? Apparently the cost of pandemic leave is too much even when stacked up against its real cost in stress, loss of livelihoods and loss of life. And this government, which, despite Scott Morrison trying to pass the buck, has responsibility for aged care, has done nothing to extend aged-care pandemic leave to cover these most vulnerable workers, these essential workers in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing the government must do is mandate proper levels of personal protective equipment and training. This chamber may be shocked to hear that there is still no nationally mandated PPE used in aged care. How can we expect staff to manage complex infection control of patients and visitors when staff have little or no training and often have highly limited access to PPE? Members have spoken to the Health Services Union when questioned about what employers were doing about PPE supplies. One care manager said they planned to make calico masks for staff. Another worker told the union that, as of last week, she was given only one mask per eight-hour shift, in clear breach of infection control protocols. And where is the federal government? We know that, prior to the outbreaks in Victoria, just one in five aged-care workers had completed the government's training modules on how to use PPE, and this was weeks after the earlier outbreaks at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they don't listen to our aged-care providers, the Prime Minister and aged-care minister could look at the revelations in the final report on the Newmarch House tragedy. Just last week we learned that, as of now, the Morrison government has spent only half the funding committed to addressing the critical surge staffing problem, and now we have a growing crisis of worker fatigue and stress across the sector. As Health Services Union National President Gerard Hayes said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The chronic underfunding of aged care has created the perfect storm for the devastating effects of COVID-19 that we now see in Victoria and have witnessed at Newmarch House in NSW.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that, even with a strategy to create a surge workforce, it will not solve the underlying problem, which is that 20 per cent of workers in aged care have at least two places of work because of their extremely low pay and zero-hour contracts in the sector. Honouring our older Australians means committing to providing decently paid and secure work for the people who are relied on the most.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of urgency regarding aged care raised by Senator Keneally. The vulnerability of elderly Australians to COVID-19 is an emotional and tragic issue not lost on this government. Members from all sides of politics have shared stories with each other about the tragedy of COVID-19 deaths in Australian nursing homes. The extreme vulnerability of our elderly and infirm to this insidious virus has been evident both here in Australia and in other countries around the world where COVID-19 battles are raging. No-one has yet executed the perfect solution. Ideally, we wouldn't lose a single life. Sadly, that's not been the case. We've witnessed multiple deaths at state-run nursing homes in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, with one death recorded in Tasmania. Whilst it angers me that Labor continue to politicise this horrendous situation, it does not surprise—even when their own party has worked, and sometimes failed, to eliminate the tragedies of multiple deaths in aged-care facilities in their states. These tragedies include the pain of families cut off from their loved ones. I haven't seen my own mother for close to six months, and, while she really hasn't recognised me for the past few years, it was a treat to have her remember me recently during a FaceTime call arranged by her residential home. In fact, I've barely seen my father for six months either, as the village where he lives—independently, but close to my mother—has been shut off to outside visitors. But it's for my father that I ache, at the thought that, although married to my mother for more than half a century, he is forbidden to walk down the corridor and hold her hand to ease her confusion. My heart aches for other families, desperate to see their loved ones as time runs out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now's not the time for finger-pointing and cheap political point-scoring. Now's the time for action and improvement. That's why, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've provided $1 billion to support seniors in aged care. Of that money, a quarter of a billion dollars has been provided to residential aged-care providers for costs associated with COVID-19, and another half a billion dollars has been provided to assist with important measures, including $234 million provided for direct care. That money is for staff retention, both in residential care and for those working to provide home-based aged care. $78 million has been provided to ensure the continuity of the aged-care workforce through a temporary increase to the residential care subsidy. We have injected $26.9 million to boost the residential care and home care viability supplement and the residential care homeless supplement. We have provided $92 million to support home care and CHSP providers, and $12.3 million has been given to boost the My Aged Care service. And we haven't forgotten the workers, with unlimited assistance for those workers at COVID-19 affected facilities, that includes extra staff that have been brought on. We've provided $101 million solely for preparedness measures to aged-care providers to manage and prevent outbreaks, through infection control training for their workforce including the extra workers that have been brought on to help throughout the pandemic. The federal government has been writing the states many cheques. It's the one thing we can do, and we haven't shirked our responsibility on that front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we've provided close to $60 million for meal delivery services like Meals on Wheels to support senior Australians in need of food or groceries. We've provided an additional $10 million for the Community Visitors Scheme to ensure, where regulations permit, that some Australians in aged care are not isolated due to visiting restrictions like border closures. We've even provided $9 million to support Indigenous elders living in urban areas to deal with the impact of isolation, and for transport to medical appointments. That money may also be utilised for welfare checks, and even food, where necessary. In Victoria, where local health officials have struggled to manage the death rate, we've now taken further measures with another $9 million provided to support a coordinated response between the Commonwealth and the Victorian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've extended the aged-care COVID-19 preparedness measure, with $81 million provided for additional aged-care workers and increased training. There's $8.4 million for supplementary payments to include quarantine costs and interstate staff, and $1.5 million has been provided to ensure appropriate and regular communications from Healthdirect to the families and loved ones of aged-care residents impacted by COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public health officials have provided their best advice, as have we. Sadly, that advice hasn't always been a success. But, of course, with 92 per cent of aged-care facilities COVID-free, we keep working. Right now in the aged-care area we're comparing favourably with other countries. But we're not infallible. We made the best decisions, made on the best advice daily. An additional $12½ million has been provided for grief and trauma support services to assist aged-care residents and their families who've experienced a COVID-19 outbreak. That increase means that the government has provided more than $100 million for these services, yet we're not just reacting; we are planning for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $9 million for the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission to continue its vital work supporting aged-care providers across the country to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks. Then there's the funding to help aged-care workers in hot spots. Whether they be aged-care or residential care workers, this funding supports their needs for self-isolation and, where necessary, alternative accommodation. The federal government has responded with additional funding for additional PPE from the National Medical Stockpile, providing Victorian aged-care providers with five million more face masks and half a million face shields. As part of this strategy the commission will commence unannounced visits to monitor infection control and infection equipment protocols.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has made some very tough decisions—decisions that have impacted so many. We've instituted strong and often painful restrictions on visitation at aged-care homes. We've provided emergency leave for aged-care residents whose loving families want to look after them. We've temporarily removed restrictions on international students working in aged care. And we've provided additional flexibility to home-care providers for personal monitoring services. These measures all complement the $1.1 billion we've spent on face masks and other protective measures Australia-wide. We're tackling isolation and loneliness in older Australians, with close to $5 million for FriendLine, a national telephone support for older Australians, to expand the phone support services until 2024. There's $1 million for digital devices, such as mobile phones and laptops, for at-risk seniors. There's also been the establishment of an Older Persons COVID-19 Support Line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And don't forget that there's other funding that impacts aged care, with $100 million for a new COVID-19 telehealth consultation Medicare item. There's $25 million for home medicine services, $5 million to fast-track the rollout of electronic prescribing across Australia and $50.7 million for the expansion of a national triage phone line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But are we infallible? No. Our Prime Minister has said so today. He tasked the royal commission into aged care to examine our response even as we act. Senator Keneally can thump the table and try to insist that we have no plan. I've just outlined our plan—and it's been outlined before. She's insulted healthcare workers and suggested that they failed in their infection control measures. In fact, most of them have succeeded, with 92 per cent of aged-care homes COVID-free. Her theatre to try to evoke emotions of a lonely death in aged-care facilities is nothing short of embarrassing—let alone insulting to the hardworking staff. Many of our own staff, our health workers and health bureaucrats have suffered these very real situations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And whilst it's encouraging to think that Senator Keneally has been moved by stories that she's heard in the media, the government's far from being unaware or uncaring or even directly involved in this. We are working closely with our state counterparts to save lives. We're making decisions based on the best health advice that we can rely on. Perhaps the Labor Party should rethink the politicisation of this challenging issue. Their criticisms are unhelpful and capture their own state party members.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I rise in support of this motion. The Morrison government has repeated the line that, once a virus gets into the community, the consequences for aged-care homes are inevitable. What an excuse! 'Inevitable'—as though there was no way the dire consequences and deaths in aged care could have been avoided or mitigated. I don't accept that, Australians don't accept that and the government certainly shouldn't accept that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing for the government to blame community transmission for the shocking death toll in aged-care facilities, but it's another not to have properly planned for outbreaks. We saw what happened overseas. We saw what unfolded at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House outbreaks in April. But did the government learn from those lessons, especially to expect the sudden departure of regular carers and nurses and to provide PPE training? Of course not. Seven months into the pandemic, the federal government's learnings have been slow and deeply disappointing. I give my deepest condolences to the families of the 328 loved ones who have lost their lives in residential aged care because of COVID-19 and the seven people who contracted COVID-19 and passed away while receiving in-home care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The weaknesses in our aged-care system have not been caused by the virus; they have been exposed in glaring focus. The minute we knew the virus was spreading, the federal government should have snapped to attention. The system was already broken. We don't need the royal commission to tell us that the current system, largely motivated by profit, is not fit for purpose, unless that purpose is to make money off our most vulnerable. Going forward, I hope the government realises that aged care can no longer be business as usual. Enough with the excuses. Government must act responsibly now.</span>

This is the number of aged-care residents who have passed away due to coronavirus, and I want to pass on my condolences to their families at this time. I cannot begin to imagine how difficult it has been for families who haven't been able to visit and sit with their loved ones before they died. We hear stories of spouses unable to hold their partner's hand one last time and parents and grandparents unable to see their children and grandchildren in their final moments. It is an absolute tragedy. We are facing an aged-care disaster, and we need real leadership—new leadership—from the Morrison government to face this disaster.</span>

This is a national crisis and a national shame. So where is the plan to deal with it? We knew this virus was highly infectious. We knew it was deadly, particularly for older people. We saw it happen in other countries first. But, despite this highly infectious disease appearing, no plan was put in place for aged care by this government. There was no plan for infection control, no plan for personal protective equipment—no plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The alarm bells really rang back in April when the first aged-care outbreaks occurred, but the lessons just weren't learnt, and so history has repeated itself, with the disease tragically spreading through aged-care homes in Victoria. The Newmarch House report confirms that this is the case—that, despite issues been clearly identified as contributing to those early outbreaks, nothing was done to fix them. There were issues with staffing levels due to quarantine requirements, issues with infection prevention and control, issues with serious shortages of PPE, issues with communication and confusion. But what did the government do to address these issues? What did the government do to address issues that they knew presented huge risks to aged-care centres and to their residents? They spent only half of the funds they committed to addressing surge capacity for staffing. Only one out of five aged-care workers had completed the Morrison government's training on how to correctly use PPE. They did no audit of PPE stock, despite 1,300 aged-care providers requesting access to the national stockpile. Why did the government not address these issues?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care workforce has been absolutely heroic during this time. They are dedicated, and I know that they are also devastated at the loss of life in aged care. They work hard every day, caring for some of our most vulnerable Australians, but they are underequipped, they are understaffed and they are exhausted. So many are in low-paid and insecure jobs. They deserve better, and so do the older Australians and families who are relying on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care system is broken and it has been for years. Inquiry after inquiry, report after report, review after review all point to an aged-care sector that has been struggling to deliver for the older Australians who rely on it. So who is responsible for this? Is it the Liberal-National coalition that has been in government for seven years? Apparently not, according to the Prime Minister. Is it Senator Colbeck, the minister for aged care? Apparently not. One of these numerous reports, <span style="font-style:italic;">A matter of care</span>, specifically recommended sweeping action to ensure aged-care workers had access to appropriate training. Today, the commissioners presiding over the aged-care royal commission said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Had the Australian Government acted upon previous reviews of aged care, the persistent problems in aged care would have been known much earlier and the suffering of many people could have been avoided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The suffering could have been avoided, but the Prime Minister and the minister for aged care haven't listened. They sat on that report for two years, just like they sat on the lessons that could have been learned earlier in the COVID crisis. This is a gross abdication of responsibility. It is a gross demonstration of incompetence, and it is causing families pain, heartache and loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Colbeck, when answering questions on aged care in front of the COVID-19 inquiry, couldn't even answer how many Australians in aged care had died of COVID-19 and how many active cases there were. He couldn't tell the inquiry if he had briefed either the national cabinet or the federal cabinet. There is a crisis in Australian aged care, and cabinet may or may not have been briefed on it. Despite this, the Prime Minister and Minister Cormann have leapt to Minister Colbeck's defence. This is the same Prime Minister who has tried to say that his government is simultaneously somehow not responsible for aged care in Australia but also prepared and has a plan in place. Which is it? Because Australians need to see this government step up and prevent more deaths from COVID-19 in our aged-care system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enough is enough. It's time to stop shifting the blame. It's time to stop avoiding responsibility. We need solutions, not excuses. Scott Morrison's government is responsible for aged care. It is responsible for making sure there's a plan to keep Australians safe in this COVID-19 crisis, and it's time that they discharged that responsibility.</span>

                  <a href="287062" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McLACHLAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I rise to speak to a matter of urgency moved by Senator Keneally, which concerns and incorporates some, in my view, unfair criticisms of the coalition government in relation to its response to the COVID-19 impact on the aged-care sector. In particular, the motion calls on the Prime Minister and the minister, Senator Colbeck, to demonstrate leadership and take responsibility. My response to that call is that it has been answered and it is being answered and it will continue to be answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I oppose the motion, and I strongly oppose it, I do join Senator Keneally in extending my sympathies to the families who have lost loved ones because of the virus. I know I can be confident that every honourable senator in this place feels the same sentiment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mover of this motion appears to have crafted their propositions based on articles that have appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> or media of similar disposition. The mover of the motion has failed to properly reflect on the incredible and Herculean efforts that have been undertaken by the coalition government to keep our aged safe. Aristotle said, 'To avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.' The federal government, the coalition government, is a government of action in an environment that is difficult, challenging, and ever-changing. While the motion is critical of the Prime Minister and Minister Colbeck, I praise them both. The Prime Minister has said this has been his No. 1 focus. This does not sound like a leader seeking to deflect blame or refusing to take responsibility. Rather, it is the opposite. The minister, Senator Colbeck, has worked extremely hard and his endeavours have been extremely effective. It is difficult to think at this time of having a more capable or effective minister to face these challenges. To unfairly lay criticism on the minister is to ignore that the states also have a critical role to play in the movement of people in their jurisdictions, for they govern the public health laws that apply to these facilities. We must bear in mind the providers that have been supported by the federal government who also have a critical role to play. This is why the coalition government has chosen to work collaboratively and closely with the states and the providers and not seek, as Labor are doing today, to lay blame and sow discourse and disharmony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is scaling up its aged-care support programs in Victoria and across Australia with an additional $171.5 million to boost a new COVID-19 response plan, which has been agreed by all states and territories. This brings the total Commonwealth funding to support this sector to more than $1 billion. This $1 billion dollars is being used to support the sector, including directly and indirectly supporting providers and the sector overall, and, importantly, to support residents and staff. For example, the federal and Victorian governments have established a dedicated Victorian Aged Care Response Centre in Melbourne to coordinate support to each aged-care provider experiencing an outbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government did understand the implications the spread of COVID-19 could have for the aged-care workforce. This is why it set out a plan, in the early days, to reinforce and repair the sector with tangible actions. This included providing critical information to providers and initially committing $101.2 million to help build capacity through a workforce surge program. The Morrison government is committed to providing an unlimited amount of surge workforce facilities during this outbreak. That is an incredible commitment by the minister and the Prime Minister. It is worth noting that the government is also delivering record investment in the aged-care system over the forward estimates. From $13.3 billion in 2012-13, under Labor, it grows to $21.4 billion in 2019-20 to an estimated $25.4 billion in 2022-23. This is, on average, $1.2 billion of extra support for older Australians each year over the forward estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also point out to honourable senators that it is the Prime Minister, a Liberal Prime Minister, that called a royal commission into aged care quality and safety. This is not the act of a government that is avoiding accountability or responsibility. Rather, this is a government that has no fear of accountability, that seeks out responsibility and that is driven to protecting the most vulnerable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I rise to support Senator Keneally's motion. One might think that the lessons of the first wave of COVID-19 might have been learned to avoid the tragedies we have seen in aged care in Victoria, but they weren't. Unfortunately, that's not surprising. It's not surprising because governments have not paid enough attention to aged-care events playing out every day in aged care, even prior to COVID-19. The system has been limping along for some time, with band-aids being applied, sometimes one on top of the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to take charge of aged care, and they need to be doing so for the purposes of COVID-19—which is not going away; we can't be sure that it's going away anytime soon—but also for the long term. Being a person who likes to put forward propositions, I say that one of the first things that needs to happen in the short term is we need to have focus on this issue. That means a single minister for aged care, not one sharing other portfolios. The Morrison government should move to have a minister for aged care working solely on that particular portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to have a COVID plan for residential aged care so everyone has a consistent understanding of the response and how to respond. In the longer term, we need to address the whole issue of aged care, of course informed by things like the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Nothing I say here is a criticism of any of the workers involved; they have done their best under the circumstances. Finally, I would also like to extend my condolences to those who have passed.</span>

I raise the fact that, in my correspondence both to the Prime Minister and to the Premier of Queensland, I expressed concern over their use of insufficient and flawed modelling to lock us all away and cause untold damage to our economy and businesses and jobs.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If, as I suggested in March, the federal government and state governments had learned from nations like Taiwan and promptly adopted rigorous testing combined with strict isolation of their sick, aged and vulnerable, then many Australians could have stayed at work, with minimal economic disruption and better health. The difference is that Taiwan had a plan and relied on solid data, and, as a result, Taiwan have had seven deaths in the time we've had 517. They have a similar population to ours in terms of total population, yet they're under greater threat because of their highly densely populated country and because they're closer to China.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland's own Chief Health Officer, Dr Jeannette Young, has stated this past week that she is only looking at the health issues, and this is very concerning. Who is looking after the big picture for us all? What about mental health, economic health, jobs, families and businesses? The Queensland Premier referred us to the location of a website for her data. We checked. There's no relevant data—a weak Premier, irresponsibly abdicating her duties, hiding behind the Queensland Chief Health Officer. The Morrison and the Queensland governments both need to step up and demonstrate leadership and tell the truth, and they need to show us the data and the plan across all aspects of managing a way out of this pandemic and the resulting recession and, in the process, ensure security for all Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  [by video link] I rise—digitally—to take note of item 12, which is the ANAO follow-up performance audit on the Lobbying Code of Conduct. As people probably realise, the Australian federal lobbying system is widely considered to be incredibly weak compared to international standards, and to state and territory standards for that matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system is made up of the lobbying code and the public lobbying register and it has been criticised for having only limited transparency and imposing rules that are relatively loose, and not comprehensively or independently policed and which carry little serious punishment. That's why the ANAO looked into this two years ago. They issued some recommendations that were ignored—my words, not theirs. They have subsequently done a follow-up audit two years down the track to see if anyone took any notice of their recommendations the first time around. Sadly, the short version is: no. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the ANAO found in June that the government does not adequately assess conflict-of-interest risks or monitor compliance with the Lobbyist Code of Conduct. Frankly, the lack of transparency about who ministers are meeting with is staggering. It is no wonder the community has lost confidence in the impartiality of its representatives and think that politicians are simply for sale to the latest person that took them out for lunch. It has almost gotten to the stage where the lobbyist might as well just be running the chamber, to cut out the middle person. It's incredibly disappointing, because we have these codes of conduct and registers and the ANAO has found that they are not properly enforced, that in the hand-over from PM&amp;C to the Attorney-General's Department—who are now in charge of the lobbying code and the register—there was a litany of bungles and a continued failure to advise anyone what the rules are and a failure to implement them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty tragic that there have been two ANAO reports and still we have very little action from the government. The ANAO used—for them—incredibly damning words. They said that governance arrangements to oversee the implementation of the ANAO recommendation were 'limited in their effectiveness'. They said there was no implementation planning in the transition from PM&amp;C to Attorney-General's, that the Attorney-General's Department did not develop a strategy to raise awareness of the code and that there were limited activities undertaken to inform lobbyists and government representatives of their compliance obligations under the code. The Attorney-General's Department did not systematically assess risks to compliance with the code and did not advise the government about the sufficiency of the current compliance framework. Lastly, they did not develop an evaluation framework or performance measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You could not get a more clear criticism of this administrative bungle. Perhaps it's deliberate. We know this government are not big fans of transparency. They are big fans of lobbyists. So who knows? But we have had two ANAO reports now. The government needs to clean up its act. It needs to get rid of this revolving door for advisers, MPs and lobbyists. That's why the Greens have pushed for an awfully long time now to have a properly enforced lobbying code including a proper cooling-off period of five years for former ministers before they go off and work for the people they were meant to be regulating while they were sitting in parliament. That cooling-off period should be expanded to include other people. We have pushed for a proper parliamentary standards commissioner who is actually responsible for enforcing rules like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we all acknowledge that the community deserves better representation. The people want their democracy back. They're sick of it being held hostage to big donors, vested interests and lobbyists. So we have a chance now. There are some clear directions and recommendations from the ANAO, once more, for reform. Let's hope that this time they actually get the attention they deserve. Thank you. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is report No. 9 from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, dated 18 August 2020. This report covers two highly draconian pieces of legislation which erode fundamental human rights in this country. Those two bills are the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Bill 2020 and the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of these bills will allow ASIO to detain and interrogate people as young as 14—that is, children—for politically motivated activities and to use tracking devices without a warrant issued by the courts, and contains many other draconian elements. The second bill will ban detainees inside immigration detention facilities from having access to a range of items including mobile phones and will allow, in fact, for a blanket ban to be put on mobile phones in the possession of detainees inside immigration detention facilities. That bill will give staff inside immigration detention facilities greater powers—with less oversight—than police have when dealing with the general public. That bill is designed to silence the capacity of detainees to record and publish human rights abuses perpetrated against them and will have a chilling effect on their capacity to participate in political debate in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because this report considers those two bills, which engage so many fundamental human rights, it beggars belief that the chair along with government members of that committee have once again chosen to ignore the independent legal advice received by the committee. Human rights are under sustained attack in Australia. We are the only liberal democracy in the world without a charter of rights or a bill of rights, which makes this committee one of the most important committees in the parliamentary system. The committee's job is to provide a technical assessment of whether proposed legislation complies with Australia's international human rights obligations. It should never be run for political purposes. But, unfortunately, the chair and Liberal and National party members of this committee are doing just that. The only reason for LNP members to so blatantly ignore the committee's independent legal advice is that they are embarrassed that the government holds human rights in such contempt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is becoming a police state and a surveillance state, and the LNP members of this committee are aiding and abetting the government on that dangerous journey. They are doing so by masking the legitimate scrutiny of these bills by ignoring the independent legal advice to this committee when it suits them, thereby undermining the important role that the committee plays in scrutinising legislation. The blatant and rampant politicisation of this committee by the chair and other government members enables the ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms and liberties in Australia. It assists the government as it frogmarches this country down the dangerous path towards authoritarianism and totalitarianism. This is how fascism starts.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  There's an important principle that should be stated clearly at the outset of this debate: the government should not be using COVID-19 as a sneaky back door to cut services or implement pre-existing agendas. Labor sends this message loud and clear. The postal service changes before parliament began as an opportunistic cost- and job-cutting exercise. These changes do not arise from circumstances that are brought about by the pandemic but, instead, were planned well before the pandemic and are intended to be snuck through by the government at a time when people are looking to the government for trusted responses. These are not intended to be temporary changes but permanent cuts that bypass normal consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The structural direction of the long-term agenda is outlined in the $1.3 million Boston Consulting Group report that was commissioned by the finance minister and handed to the government on 21 February. We understand that that report proposes cuts to service standards, cuts to jobs and the closure of post offices. The secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications has even revealed that the cabinet had already resolved to continue the recommendations of the report prior to COVID-19 and, indeed, that that report did recommend cuts, cuts, cuts and closures. This is what Mr Atkinson, the secretary, had to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My recollection was it was commissioned by cabinet to come back to cabinet for consideration, and it came back in its normal scheduled time. That just happened to be in COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's pretty clear, isn't it? The government had been planning to consider recommendations to cut the postal service well before COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tricky foundation—and it is tricky—of this approach and the regulations that are before us has been made clear by the number of untruths the government has felt compelled to tell to justify this position. First, they said Australia Post was going to go broke and would have to cut costs because of declining revenues. They laid all that out in an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 31 March under the headline 'Australia Post forced to slash costs as coronavirus hits revenues'. This story happened to be dropped on the very same day a formal request was made to shareholder ministers for the regulatory changes. There's a problem with that story—quite a big problem. Overall revenues were going up. They were not going down, as was asserted in the story, and the Senate has learned that, in fact, Australia Post was forecasting more revenue as a result of COVID and this, in fact, is what occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence to the Senate established that parcel volumes were 37.2 per cent higher in April 2020 than they were in March. It makes sense, doesn't it—if you think about it for even a moment before you drop your story to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>? Of course revenues will go up. Parcel volumes have gone through the roof, and Australia Post is the primary carrier of parcels in Australia. So, once that narrative fell apart, they then tried to claim that addressed letter volumes had collapsed by 50 per cent. Uh-uh. In response to written questions on notice by Labor senators, Australia Post submitted that addressed letter volumes went from 139 million in February 2020 before the pandemic to 155 million in March, when the lockdown began. That's a 12 per cent increase. That's another misleading narrative taken apart by Senate scrutiny. Then, in the third attempt, the minister tried to claim that postal delivery workers were not busy enough and that, through these regulations, he was giving them work to do. What a disrespectful and ignorant thing to say. Frontline postal workers have never been busier. That is a statement of fact. They are incredibly busy. And they have been working endlessly for our communities throughout COVID—busier than ever. They deserve respect, not insults from an uninformed minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister then wrote to a Senate committee and claimed that posties were previously dedicated to handling and delivering letters and that he was liberating them for redeployment to deliver parcels. That is also not true. There is no such thing as a postie dedicated to delivering letters in Australia. Posties deliver parcels and letters, including essential medicines, and they have done so every day of the week for years. And, if the minister won't take advice from the representatives of workers, perhaps he should read what the executive general manager of deliveries at Australia Post said to the Senate back in 2018. Mr Barnes said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today we see nearly 45 per cent of all parcels delivered by posties. So when you think of the context of the letters declining at 10 per cent per year, that's been a big boost for our posties in keeping them busier out there. We expect to see that close to 50 per cent within a year and a half.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical point is that, when a postie visits your home five days a week, they're also carrying parcels five days a week. So why would the government feel the need to make unnecessary and incorrect assertions that posties only carry letters? The minister has used this language to imply that postal workers have less and less to do as letter volumes decline. But, in fact, as letter volumes decline, postal workers deliver an increasing volume of small to medium-sized packets and parcels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Australia Post wrote to members of parliament last week saying that the alternate day delivery model was only just coming into effect on 31 August. If the changes were so urgent that the minister, as he claims, couldn't have undertaken any consultation, why take four months to implement them? The answer is that the reduced delivery model was designed on the assumption that one in four postal workers would not have a job. We've had unions and postal workers give evidence to the Senate that postal workers across the country were being told that one in four wouldn't have a role. So my colleague Senator Green asked this question:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Can I just be clear so that this is understood: there is the document that you were briefed with, which shows that Dan … no longer has a round to perform. And what you're saying today is that that information was not only briefed to you, it was also briefed to senior management and also out to workplaces?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The witness, Mr Murphy, says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Correct. They were briefed at workplaces similar to Lisarow … that one in four posties no longer had a job to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Green asks the other witness to confirm that that was the briefing, and Mr Morton says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yes, from our management at our delivery facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So once the government had to give up on the idea that, in the middle of a pandemic, they were going to implement massive job cuts at Australia Post, they were forced back to the drawing board and spent months trying to figure out how to integrate the fourth postal worker into a model that was designed for three. This government have been making this up as they go along. The foundations of their arguments and their policy rationale were dishonest to begin with. That's why they tried to use COVID-19 to bypass consultation with workers in the community. This is a joke, and it's also not the standard that the community expects from their government at this critical time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a minister unwilling to be straight with the public. We have a $1.3 million review into Australia Post that the government refuses to release. We have a government making it up as they go along. The Labor Party will seek to disallow these regulations because the government needs to get a clear message: COVID-19 should not be used as a cover to sneak through existing agendas. It's an important principle, and one that's at stake in a number of areas of public policy.</span>

To support Australia Post to continue providing the postal services Australians need during the COVID-19 crisis the government has granted it temporary regulatory relief until 30 June 2021. These changes provide Australia Post with the flexibility to redeploy its workforce to manage the dramatic increase in parcel volume and decrease in letters accelerated as a result of COVID-19. Australia Post have made a commitment that there will be no forced redundancies or across-the-board reductions in wages due to the temporary arrangements. The government will review the changes before the end of the year.</span>

                    </a>  I wish to make a few points. This is a private senator's bill from Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party. Senator Roberts is the initiator of this bill. I want to make a couple of quick remarks on the report and some clarifications that need to be made. This is to do with the so-called 'bail in' possibility of banking institutions bailing in depositors that has gained some traction in the community. I rise this afternoon really to make one key point: that there is, and the report makes clear that there is, no ambiguity in need of rectification by this private senator's bill. It is not possible under current law and regulation for APRA to require banks to bail in deposit accounts. The Reserve Bank, APRA and Treasury all agree that the Banking Act does not imply that losses could be imposed on deposit holders or give APRA any additional powers that could be used to the detriment of retail depositors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Depositors are already safeguarded under a range of protections such as the Financial Claims Scheme, which the Treasurer may activate in the event that a bank fails. Upon activation, APRA provides depositors with access to their deposits within seven days, up to a $250,000 cap. This covers around 99 per cent of deposit accounts in full, and around 80 per cent of household deposits by value. There is a depositors' preference system which applies to deposits above the FCS cap and means that, in the event a bank fails, the claims of depositors rank above all equity holders and creditors. There are numerous layers of prudential regulation and interventions APRA can make to resolve financial institutions in distress, such as recapitalisation, statutory management and the transfer of powers.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I resume my speech on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. I'll tell you what these big talkers have done so far. They've brought out a fancy marketing campaign to try and hide the fact that they've taken a sledgehammer to our TAFEs. It's been happening for years under both majors. That's what they've been doing. They very quietly ripped $4 billion out of TAFEs last year. That's our government. That's supposed to be a party of the fair go, but apparently not for tradies and not for apprentices. No fair go for those guys. And the ALP, the supposed party of the worker, helped them do it. The hypocrisy of it drives me absolutely nuts and actually makes my blood boil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just imagine what we could have done with that money. It could have gone to desperately needed upgrades to the equipment that we should be training our kids on. That money could have fixed the holes in the windows, the leaks in the roof, the asbestos throughout those buildings. We could have used it to fund new courses so that students in the regions don't have to move away from home to get any choice in what they want to study. This is the situation that our TAFEs are in. This is the sad reality. They are getting by on the smell of an oily rag. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that my local TAFE is training students on machines that date back to the Cold War. Yet these guys are still supposed to be able to go straight into a new job with new machines that actually work off IT systems, not something from the Cold War. That's what the government are setting them up for—they are setting them up for failure. The majors have been letting the TAFEs struggle along for years, to the point of no return—God forbid! God help our children that don't want to go to universities. I tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, there are a lot that don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that the government are in crisis, they turn around and expect TAFE to be able to help pull us out of this. Well, you're kidding yourselves. You've absolutely trashed them. You've trashed them for our kids, you've trashed them for our apprentices and you've trashed them for the teachers who want to teach our kids. You want to turn this around, saying we need it turned around before Christmas time. Come on. Be realistic. Be honest with yourselves. You've gutted the sector, you've turned a blind eye and you've put us in this mess. We aren't going to get out of it with a bunch of governance bills to make tiny changes to the way the sector gets regulated. I mean, hello! You are shifting the deck chairs on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>. Our TAFEs are sinking under a weight they were never going to be able to handle, and the people who need TAFE are being let down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I got an email last week from another young apprentice, just one of many, who can't finish his degree because—guess what?—he can't access the teachers to finish his course and start working. He can't go any further with his apprenticeship. How many more students end up at university because they know they won't have the support they need at TAFE? The support is no longer there. How many people are winding up on the dole queue because they can't get retrained? And yet the federal government announced they were fast-tracking 15 critical infrastructure projects, putting $1.5 billion—that's right—into the economy in July. In the last two weeks, Queensland, Western Australia and my own home state of Tasmania announced record spending on infrastructure. The government's HomeBuilder program is rolling out now and it's supposed to keep the construction industry going. But will the sparkies, the chippies and the scaffies be there to make those renos happen? I don't think so. There's your problem. The follow-through just isn't there. That's the problem with this whole government idea of yours. You are so out of touch. When it is election time, those politicians can't wait to get into some high-vis jackets. Let's be honest: you all love having cameras on you on high-vis day. But, when it comes to making sure our next generation of tradies have the equipment, the facilities and the teachers they need you actually don't give a stuff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get our TAFEs cranking for our kids—not next year, now. If you haven't started already you've failed, so I guess you've failed. This is not just about our kids. It is not just about our TAFEs. This is for the hearts of our communities. This is for our economy. This is why we need to get this moving. Properly sourced, we could make our TAFEs what they were a generation ago—community hubs that offered our young people trade skills that would actually get them good jobs, supporting them, their families and their communities for years to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three generations of my family went through the Devonport TAFE. It got my mum off the factory floor, it got my son his tradie ticket and it got me a business degree. It was a place where we went to find a new future. It was the heart of the community. Everyone keeps saying we're in this together, but are we? Are we really in this together? Or is it just more lip service? For Australians who want to be able to upskill at their local TAFE, it sure doesn't feel like we're in this together. Devonport's TAFE is teaching student nurses on floorboards that let in paint fumes from the floor below. You guys have been very aware of that. Your Tasmanian Liberal counterparts have been very aware of that and still nothing has been done. I raised this with you guys well over 10 months ago. It hasn't been fixed. You are not showing any initiative; I can tell you that much.</span>

                    </a>  We're teaching kids trades on equipment that's older than they are. Some of it was made during the Cold War. Floors are rusted through and roofs are falling in. Yet the coalition, the ones in government, are arguing over who is to blame. Great! It doesn't matter how much TAFE costs if the qualifications it offers aren't valued. I want TAFE valued, I want it honoured and I want it fixed. You are all arguing that it is the other guys who need to do something about it. Get real. Show some initiative. Just show some initiative. Make some good, solid decisions. Get in there and fix it. Instead of paying lip service, actually fix it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Voters don't want to know who to blame for the collapse in the training and trades sector. They are not interested. They don't care. They just don't care about that. Voters want a trades and training sector that isn't collapsing, full-stop. Let's be honest: that is what is happening. Wall to wall, floor to ceiling, it is crumbling in front of our eyes, and yet the coalition in government are arguing about how many commissioners should sit on a board of an ineffective regulator. It's just another board sitting on top. It's just another one that will get nothing done. It's just to make it look like you are actually achieving something. That bothers me terribly. As soon as you can't get something right and make it happen, you put up a board. That is what you do. That is the normal Liberal way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you care about our trades, care enough to save them. Until then, spare us the speeches about how bad the other guys are. I won't waste a second arguing who is worst. I just want what's best, because I went to TAFE, like my mum and like my son, and I see what it did for my family and what it has done for the people in my part of town and my community and what that heart and soul meant when it was up and running and pumping at 110 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen how much that meant to our community and how much was achieved for our kids, and all I see now is that it's got a boot on its neck and it's struggling. It is struggling to breathe, and we've got the time in the Senate to give it some breathing room, but instead we're spending hours debating who gets to be on the board of a regulator, getting overtime and no doubt paid an arm and a leg—to do what? Another regulator? Another board? To do what? To do the job that, apparently, ministers on that side are not able to do, because, if they were, they wouldn't be paying their mates to try to get the job done, which they don't either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where parliament in this country has got to these days. A minister can't get the job done. They pay their mates to do a board; that's how it works. Quite frankly, you should be ashamed of yourselves. If that's what you're doing—and that's what you are doing—you should not be a minister in this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I rise to sum up the debate on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020 and I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate. Delivering excellence in training lies at the heart of the coalition government's skills agenda, and that can only be achieved with a regulatory approach that is fair, transparent and effective and with a regulator that continually evolves, builds organisational capability and engages with the vocational education and training sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the Senate ensures that the national VET regulator, the Australian Skills Quality Authority, otherwise known as ASQA, has a more effective, modern and fit-for-purpose governance structure. It responds to both the Braithwaite and Joyce reviews, which called on ASQA to adopt a greater educative role and to improve its regulatory approach. Further, it aligns with findings from the rapid review undertaken by regulatory experts into ASQA's governance, culture and processes. The government released the final rapid review report on 30 April 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms before us will ensure that ASQA is well positioned to support the VET sector with navigating the current COVID-19 environment and, more importantly, to guide the sector's recovery and regrowth once the pandemic abates. In this context, on 12 April 2020 the Australian government announced measures that provide regulatory fee relief for the VET sector. Certain fees and charges between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2021 will be waived and relevant fees already paid will be reimbursed. This will assist the financial viability of registered training organisations, support business operations during the pandemic and foster recovery once travel and operational restrictions are relaxed. The revised governance model in the bill will also assist as it draws on best practice for Commonwealth regulators and will enable ASQA to better allocate and clarify operational roles and responsibilities and to improve regulatory decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing three-commissioner model will be replaced by a single agency head to be known as the Chief Executive Officer of ASQA, who will lead ASQA's strategic direction and improve efficiency. Starting reform at the top and working down ensures a positive impact on the agency's culture and supports a revised and revitalised organisational structure anticipated as part of the agency reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the bill establishes a statutory advisory council consisting of diverse multidisciplinary experts who will provide ASQA with access to strategic guidance and direction. These appointments will be based on experience and/or knowledge rather than representing particular stakeholder interests. It is critical that the independence and expertise of the council is maintained and that one stakeholder group is not preferenced over others. This mechanism for selecting the advisory council is based on recommendations from the rapid review and accords with best-practice regulation in similar settings, thus ensuring the CEO of ASQA is provided with high-quality, independent expert advice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant reform is anticipated in the VET sector over the coming years, and these changes will position the CEO to make the necessary changes to ASQA's internal practices, enhance its educative role and address future challenges. The information-sharing provisions in the bill support the disclosure of data collected by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research to a range of bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the intention of the bill for the National Centre for Vocational Education Research to be able to disclose information to state and territory departments that have responsibility for vocational education and training, even where they are also listed on the national register as a registered training organisation. Enhanced information sharing helps governments and vocational education training regulators so that the diverse needs and requirements of all Australians are considered in policy, funding and regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is further evidence of the government's commitment to VET sector reform. It is the next stage of measures that will strengthen ASQA to engage more effectively with stakeholders while continuing to improve its regulatory approach and enhance student outcomes. A strong national regulator supports access to quality vocational education and training, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that there is TAFE, union and employer sector representation on ASQA's advisory council. Labor very much believes—and we look for the chamber's support on this issue—that it is critical that there is a public provider at the table and that the legislation before us today should mandate that this is so. Given the important role this council will have in providing strategic advice about regulatory matters, it is indeed an imperative that the council represents a cross-section of the sector while also providing essential expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that TAFE, as the public sector provider, plays an absolutely critical role, and it should be properly represented on the council. TAFE is the mainstay of our VET education across the country. We need strong institutions in the VET sector, and it is TAFE that provides that institutional strength, and indeed TAFE should be directly represented on the ASQA Advisory Council. It is the pillar of quality in vocational education, and its advice and guidance will be invaluable to ASQA. So it does not benefit anyone in our nation to have the expertise of TAFE educators sidelined in the event that TAFE does not have a recognised seat at the table. I understand that TAFE appointments could be made, but they might come from a diversity of places, a diversity of TAFEs. But it's really important that someone is seen to be mandated as a TAFE representative on ASQA. People in this sector can wear many hats, and in my view it's critically important that TAFE is formally recognised as being represented at the ASQA advisory council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want an advisory council that is not unduly weighted to representing private providers. We very much believe that this could undermine ASQA's regulatory approach. Equally, trade union representation, balanced also by representation from employer groups, is vital. Labor understands this, on both sides, from hard-earned experience in the sector. Regarding the voice of trade unions, trade unions work very hard to understand and represent their professions when it comes to regulatory advice and, indeed, advice regarding our skills agenda and ASQA. What's critically important here is that skills relate not just to the skills being taught today but to the existing skills of people who are already in the workforce and who have already acquired that education. As ASQA regulates, it needs to not only look to the current and future skills but also look back to the skills that people already hold and how they interface with each other. Trade unions are in an excellent position to assist in doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry, of course, is central to the operation of an effective skills formation system. Unions and employers have an important role in providing feedback and advice on the regulator's activities and rules, and we really want to see employers and industry directly represented on the advisory council of ASQA also. Union members—the workers—are at the coalface of training, and they know the system and its problems all too well. Union representatives get these issues fed through to them, so unions are indeed in a good place to be able to contribute that to ASQA. Indeed, trade unions, through union representation through the ACTU and other employment groups, are very good at triaging information from a diversity of points across unions, just like employer representatives do. They can triage the information that comes across the sector up into the representative advisory council of ASQA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions have been at the forefront of developing occupational standards, career path, safety and the quality of skills development in workplaces. Again, they deserve a place at the table. I would like to say to the chamber and to the government: to not have a voice for those at the coalface of work and training—that is, the people being trained and the people who hold qualifications that come from the sector—would diminish any work that ASQA do. I commend Labor's amendment to the Senate.</span>

The 2020 rapid review recommended that members of the advisory council be appointed based on their experience and/or their knowledge, rather than representing a particular stakeholder interest. This approach is consistent with best practice regulation in similar settings. The national VET regulator needs to be supported by experts to ensure continuous improvement, strategic advice and meaningful sector engagement. Choosing a representative from a stakeholder group, whether that stakeholder group be an employer group or a TAFE, is no guarantee of individual experience or knowledge of TAFE, as is envisioned by the legislation. The mechanism for choosing members outlined in the bill is appropriate and will lead to an independent skills based advisory council with members who bring expertise across a range of disciplines. This will ensure that the CEO of ASQA is provided with high-quality advice.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  The Labor Party supports a safe and secure transport sector in our nation. It needs to be managed by the right legislation and regulation to stay one step ahead of criminals and terrorists. We of course know the threats facing our transport sector are constantly evolving. It's critical that we revise and refine our laws to keep Australia's transport sector one of the safest in the world. The safety and security of all Australians is paramount. We in the Labor Party will always take the advice of our national security agencies. Labor has a consistent track record of working cooperatively and in a bipartisan manner on all matters of national security. Of course the bill before the chamber today—the Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019—is no exception.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill today amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, the aviation act, and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, the maritime act, to improve the effectiveness of screening at Australia's security controlled airports and security regulated ports. The bill before us aims to improve transport security in two important ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill before us clarifies the ability of aviation security inspectors to test aviation industry participants' security systems, including by specifically allowing inspectors to conduct system tests with the test pieces at locations beyond screening points in an airport terminal. They will be able to do this without the risk of committing an offence under other laws. For example, following the passage of the bill, aviation security inspectors will be able to expand their testing regimes to include air cargo examination and, importantly, catering facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us also establishes the framework needed to introduce a national standard of competency for aviation and maritime screening personnel. The thousands of security screeners who work hard at our airports and seaports perform a vital role. I personally am grateful—as, I'm sure, all senators and staff in this place are personally grateful—for the work they do to keep us safe in our skies. These people, our security screeners, prevent weapons, firearms and explosives from making it onto aircraft and cruise ships, ensuring we can all travel safely and securely. To me it's notable that, because they're there to make sure people aren't carrying such items, they do this largely without discovering them. It highlights the significance and importance of the screening role they play, which means that in large part people don't even attempt to get such items on board. Indeed, we're all happy to comply and participate in such screening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation ensures that the education, training and testing requirements for screeners will remain flexible, effective and relevant in an increasingly complex security environment. It gives us the framework necessary so that screeners are well-equipped to respond to threats both now and into the future. The bill introduces measures allowing the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs to prescribe the requirements associated with screeners' training, qualification and accreditation. This is with the aim of enabling screener requirements to be adapted efficiently and in response to rapid changes in the security environment, meaning that we will have a workforce that is more flexible and agile in responding to these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to draw particular attention to the important work of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in relation to this legislation. The original bill had a number of gaping holes which were identified by the committee. I'm sad to say that they do speak to the lack of due diligence that has become commonplace under this Liberal-National government. It is particularly alarming to see these issues arise within a security context. Firstly, the unamended legislation would have permitted an aviation security inspector to test an aviation industry participant's security system 'including by using an item, weapon or vehicle'. Of course, this means real weapons and, therefore, real explosives in testing the detection of such items. While the legislation notes that tests must be done in accordance with any requirements prescribed in regulations, we don't believe that delegated legislation should be used unless a sound justification is provided. As no such justification has been provided, despite the scrutiny of bills committee calling on the government to explain this lack of clarity in December, Labor will therefore move an amendment that seeks to prevent this legislation coming into force until the testing requirements are prescribed via regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the explanatory memorandum clearly states that any test pieces, such as 'imitation firearms and simulated improvised explosive devices', are designed to be inert and not to cause harm. However, as the scrutiny of bills committee noted again, this requirement does not exist on the face of the primary legislation, and Labor believes that this must be fixed. What kind of government, I ask the chamber—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—omits a requirement like this from the legislation? This is about keeping people safe in their workplaces and safe in our skies, plain and simple. In what context should people who are testing the robustness of screening be asked to use live firearms or, for example, real explosives?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We appreciate that the government has heard Labor members' urgent calls for the legislation to be amended and for an assurance that live firearms and improvised explosive devices won't be used. We are pleased to say we will, of course, support this amendment to correct this glaring oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the legislation allows the secretary to determine training and qualification requirements for screening officers by legislative instrument. However, the secretary is also empowered to exempt the class of screening officers from one or more of the requirements if exceptional circumstances exist. We acknowledge that there might be valid situations where exemptions might need to be applied. Labor believes that the application of these exemptions must be reported transparently. We thank the government in advance for their commitment to accurately and transparently answering questions in relation to these exemptions during Senate estimates. And I'd like to draw Senator Cash's attention to these remarks, which were to say to the government: we have very forthrightly argued that, for any exemptions to the training qualification requirements for screening officers—anyone who is exempted—the government should report those transparently. We're looking to the government to provide that information during Senate estimates in relation to the use of any such exemptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people put great trust in the parliament to ensure that we enact the right legislation to protect Australia's national security. We do this while also balancing any new laws with openness and transparency. So it is in a spirit of continuing to build trust with the Australian people that Labor will move these amendments. We welcome the amendments that the government will move today. We will support the amendments, as they go some way towards fixing problems with the bill. In addition, we look to moving our own amendments to fully capture the recommendations of the scrutiny of bills committee and to solve these issues in this very important bill. I have to say, a lack of due diligence and accountability has been the calling card of the Morrison government. I commend the scrutiny of bills committee for their work on this important piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We used to be able to trust the Morrison government with our borders. But, sadly, that does not appear to be the case anymore. In March this year, with the arrival of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, Prime Minister Morrison said: 'The Australian government has also banned cruise ships from foreign ports … from arriving at Australian ports.' The Prime Minister said on that same day that there 'will be some bespoke arrangements that we put in place directly under the command of the Australian Border Force to ensure that the relevant protections are put in place'. Four days later, after the Prime Minister's remarks, on 19 March the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> was allowed to disembark its 2,700 passengers in Sydney. As we know, they included sick passengers who were allowed to spread across Australia and the globe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, despite banning cruise ships and putting Border Force in direct command with bespoke arrangements, our Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, did not stop the one boat that mattered—the boat that he promised to stop. And Australians have lived with those consequences. The Prime Minister has made light of this by pointing to the fact that the Commonwealth didn't have ultimate responsibility for these issues, and so he let himself off the hook. What does not let him off the hook is the fact that he made these very public undertakings to the Australian people. In the context of this debate about safety and screening at our borders, I call on the Prime Minister to put this debate in the context of COVID-19, and I call on the Prime Minister to apologise to the hundreds of Australians who've contracted COVID-19 because of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, as well as to the family members of Australians who've lost their lives. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> is a disaster which has spread COVID-19 across Australia and the globe. It's responsible for over 1,000 cases of COVID-19; 30 tragic deaths; the north-west Tasmanian outbreak, which included 11 deaths; and 127 of the cases that I spoke about before. We cannot forget that allowing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> to dock in Sydney, despite the Prime Minister's undertakings that he would manage the situation, has been a big human tragedy. Over 30 Australians have lost their lives as a result of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that's available, I want to draw attention to issues around the Commonwealth and the ABF. When it comes to our borders, the buck should and does stop with the Commonwealth. No amount of buck-passing by the Prime Minister or his ministers absolves them of this responsibility, a responsibility which is outlined within the Constitution. We've also seen the disaster of the number of aeroplane arrivals claiming asylum, with an absolute explosion of over 100,000 aeroplane arrivals in Australia claiming asylum. We've seen Peter Dutton's half-a-billion-dollar Paladin blunder and we've also seen a litany of other Home Affairs failures. In concluding this debate today, I want to reflect that, when we're looking at standards of security at our borders and a robust system of training and testing, it's right that we have a government that pays attention to the issues in the legislation that's before us today. But we can see in that legislation significant holes that need to be fixed by amendment today, and we have seen a litany of other Home Affairs failures at Australia's borders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Duniam noted in his second reading speech, this bill 'improves the effectiveness of screening at Australia's security controlled airports and security regulated ports'. We support that, so the Greens will be supporting this bill. I'll come to some specific comments about this bill later. First, I want to take the opportunity, given we're talking about airports, to speak about the state of aviation in these difficult times that we're currently in. The COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, having massive impacts on our society. My heart goes out to people who have lost loved ones, people who are still suffering with the illness, and people who are finding getting through this pandemic really, really tough.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, COVID-19 has had, and will continue to have, significant impacts on our aviation sector, from the people who will be employed doing security checks at the airports through to people who are employed in the airline industry. We've seen a massive drop-off in flights, and, of course, one of our airlines is currently under administration. It is a travesty that our government have refused to support Virgin. They should have taken meaningful action to support one of Australia's two largest domestic carriers during the crisis. Instead, they allowed it to go into administration and we still don't know what state—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  That's an excellent adaptation, Mr Acting Deputy President. I rise to speak in favour of the Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019. Before the advent of COVID-19, 38 million people travelled through Australian airports and marine ports annually. Like the many Australians who work for our airlines, our airports, tourism operators and business travel companies, I'm really looking forward to seeing that level of movement, that kind of volume of passengers, return once the restrictions we currently face are eased. So many livelihoods, and indeed lives, depend on Australia maintaining its reputation and its record for being one of the safest places in the world to travel. That's why, as technology develops and the risk landscape evolves, as those who would seek to do us harm come up with ever more creative ways to go about it, the coalition government is doing all that is necessary to maintain that reputation for being a secure, trusted destination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain what this bill does to contribute to that important result for all Australians. The first thing it does, and this is quite significant, is create powers for aviation security inspectors to engage in covert testing of aviation industry participants' security systems. That is a whole lot of industry speak for saying that it's really important that people who work in, particularly, aviation security, but it is also true of maritime security, are able to run tests—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator Rice interjecting</span>—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator STOKER:</span>
                    </a>  It's really important that people who are working in the security space in our airports are able to conduct tests that reflect the nature of the items that might be smuggled through our airports. They need to be able to test the kinds of scenarios that might arise in the event of a terrorist scenario. And they need to be able to do it in a way that is real enough to equip the people working in these roles with the skills they need to be able to respond swiftly and with confidence in the event that the worst did happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes for sensible precautions. It means that, for instance, the weapons that would be used in conducting these types of test scenarios are dummy ones. They're not actually live weapons. They aren't live bombs. They're dummy devices. They're able to be used within airports and in mock-type scenarios to help the people who need to work in these environments, using ever-evolving new technology, to learn the skills they need to be able to adapt when it really matters. What pops into the mind of many people when they hear that is, 'Well, hold on, we've got plenty of laws in this country that say you can't have a bomb hoax at an airport. That itself is a crime,' and that is a good pick-up by those people who noticed it. So one thing that this bill also does is to make it clear that when people who work as security officers engage in these training exercises, or when training officers or inspectors come to airports and run these types of exercises, and in doing so introduce items that look like they pose a serious threat and could be construed as a hoax, they aren't actually liable under civil or criminal law for the fact of that mock scenario. So that's another important thing that the bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also clarifies and aligns the legislative basis in a consistent way across the country for training and accrediting people with qualifications for undertaking these important screening roles. As I've mentioned, the shifting technology landscape is important in security screening, and so it's important that there are opportunities for people who have been doing this work for some time to access professional education that continues to update their skills as time passes. It's also important to make sure that the training that people are receiving is sufficiently tailored to the nature of the work, not just, say, the kind of general security training that someone who might become a security guard at a nightclub, for instance, has undertaken. There is a different set of skills that's required at an airport and that is clarified by this bill. But consistency among the different places in Australia is also clarified, to make sure that we are making it easy for people who are working in this field to have their qualifications recognised wherever they go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill also provides for the creation of legislative instruments, like regulations, to make provision for the nuts and bolts of making this stuff happen—the provision of identity cards, for instance, for people who work in security screening roles and provision for what their uniforms should be like so that people who undertake these roles can be easily identified, particularly in an emergency. So these are, in broad terms, the goals of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, this is a simple and somewhat unglamorous bill. Like a lot of the hard work of government, it's not necessarily shiny or the kind of thing that people want to have reported on the front page of the paper. But it really does matter, because security staff who are up to date with how to use the latest technology, who are able to identify up-to-date threats from those who would seek to do Australians harm and who are at the top of their game because they are being regularly tested on their ability to implement those skills on the job are the people who are best placed to keep Australians safe when it matters most, and that's something that should give all Australians great confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said something about the covert security testing that will be facilitated by this bill, and it's worth explaining the situations in which inspectors and testers will have the benefit of exceptions from criminal and civil liability for their activities in training and testing people to do this work well. The circumstances in which a person would get that kind of an immunity are where the test is, firstly, conducted in good faith—they're doing it for the right reasons in the course of their work, for instance. The second criterion is that the test doesn't seriously endanger the health or safety of any person, because it's important that both people at work and passengers don't have their experience become an unsafe one as a consequence of these activities. The final criterion is that it doesn't result in significant loss of, or damage to, property. Where those three criteria are met by a person who is helping with testing and training exercises, they will get the benefit of that immunity from civil or criminal liability. It is important that we give people who are engaged in this work the ability to go about their business knowing that they're not at risk of breaching other laws like, for instance, the one I mentioned about there being bans on bomb hoaxes in our airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go to the topic, though, of the training provisions of this bill, it's worth going back to 2016, when Mr Michael Carmody completed an inquiry into aviation and maritime transport security education and training in Australia. It had a look at all of the different types of training that were done in this area, the outcomes that were being achieved by the people who had undergone that training when they were assessed and the overall quality of the training options that existed in the aviation and maritime sectors. He made a bunch of recommendations for its improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that that inquiry identified as being important was the need for clarity about what constitutes sufficient qualifications under national standards. So he suggested the introduction of standardised qualifications for people who undergo this type of work on a day-to-day basis, distinguishing it from other types of security laws, and he also highlighted the importance of there being national tests so that those people who were engaged in this work were reaching a consistent standard nationwide. He highlighted the need for ongoing on-the-job training and a continuing education and professional development program to be available for people who work in this area so that they could keep up with changes in terrorists' tactics—for those who are responsible for identifying them day-to-day, that's an important factor—and also have the ability to keep up with the technology that's being used to identify these items when they're on the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill, consistent with those recommendations, acts upon the suggestion that there should be a more specific security screening qualification, and it introduces national minimum standards for on-the-job training and continuing professional development for screening officers and it brings in national competency testing for screening officers. You might be thinking: 'What if you're someone who has been working in this field for many years and you've been doing it either with basic on-the-job training or on the basis of a more generalised security qualification? What does that mean for you?' That's a pretty fair question. The people who fall into that category will get recognition of those parts of their skillset that are relevant to their work. They will get accreditation that reflects the skill level they've reached. They will also get the benefit of a 12-month period of transition so that, if there are little extra modules that they might need to pick up in order to make sure they're meeting the national standards, they'll have some time to do that. We don't want to be unreasonable when we're asking this of people, particularly in an industry that's facing some disruption at the moment. The 12-month period will make it much easier for people to adapt to this in their career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also something to be said for the strength of the endorsement that this bill has got from parts of our community. While the Department of Home Affairs has explained why this bill is necessary, I always think it's nice to be able to look to somebody beyond the department to see whether or not it is getting the same kind of encouragement from elsewhere. This bill has received support from Dr John Coyne. He is the head of the Strategic Policing and Law Enforcement Program at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an organisation that I really respect. In the course of his submission, Dr Coyne highlighted that the provision of explicit powers for security inspectors to conduct covert security systems would provide a much-needed additional mechanism to maintain the security of Australia's aviation sector. He noted that, as screening technology improves and terrorists innovate, the minimum level of training for screening officers must also increase if they are to continue to mitigate risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's what we're doing. We're arming the people who, every day in their work, protect us by detecting threats and managing risk and who are willing to put themselves on the line as they go about making sure that they keep Australians who are travelling safe. As we give them the tools that they need to do their jobs well, it's important that we as a society make sure that we continue to look out for their interests by making sure they are at the top of their game and that we look out for Australians by equipping them to protect them as best as possible. We need to make sure it all works together to achieve something that really is quite big, and that is a safer Australian transport sector, with flow-on benefits for trade, for travel, for business relationships and for Australia's attractiveness as a safe and fun place to visit and to do business.</span>

It's not just that the government has refused to back Virgin. They also haven't supported the Dnata workers—workers who were a big part of the transport supply chain. If you caught a flight in Australia, odds are good that a Dnata worker has made that flight possible, by doing the cleaning that is so critical to keeping people safe, and providing the catering. They don't get the recognition or appreciation they deserve, but they make a crucial difference. The government has failed them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a significant amount of work to be done in the aviation sector—way beyond what we are considering tonight—that this government is failing to do. This government is letting down Australian workers and Australians around the country. Aviation has been affected massively by this pandemic. The security screening we are talking about tonight—for those workers who are working there, it's going to be a long time before the same number of workers are back on the job as pre-pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm here in my office in Melbourne—not in Canberra, obviously—because of the pandemic. I haven't flown for over six months. And it is the same for so many other frequent flyers—business people, people not flying around the country for tourism or visiting loved ones. Even if we get a vaccine, aviation is not going to just snap back. The fact that we are here tonight with this technology—as good as I hope it is continuing to be—means that we are not all going to go back to flying at the drop of a hat. We will consider whether flying interstate for a meeting is actually the best way to meet. Would a remote meeting or a video link actually suffice? Critically, should we be flying when there are other options for meeting that don't have the carbon pollution that a flight has? In an environment when there is no carbon budget left, reducing flying makes an awful lot of sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we desperately need a plan for aviation for Australia—way beyond considering security arrangements as we are considering tonight—that takes account of the impacts of this pandemic and the imperative to reduce our carbon pollution to zero. There is a future for aviation that navigates a path through these huge issues, but it needs to be explicitly identified and planned for. That's what a government should be doing, developing such a plan in collaboration with workers, with businesses, with NGOs and with communities, to ensure that workers are looked after, to ensure a future for aviation businesses, for airports and for the workers in security screening. We need a plan that takes account of the essential transport that aviation provides in this far-flung country of ours. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We Greens will keep banging the drum about this, because it's such a critical need. Having a plan for aviation would mean that we could see whether the actions we are taking now in response to the pandemic are the appropriate ones, whether they do line up as being part of a sensible, strategic, just and sustainable plan for the future of aviation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, let me now address some issues concerning the bill that we are debating tonight. The Greens support the steps the government is taking here to improve airport security. I would reiterate, however, a number of concerns that we raised in additional comments in the committee report. The explanatory memorandum specifies that security testing changes will enable the government to meet recommendations accepted from the Inspector of Transport Security and the International Civil Aviation Organization to expand the scope of system tests for a wider range or security measures but without providing any information on where these recommendations are from. When the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee examined this bill, this report had not been published. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An additional aspect in this bill is the fact that it will allow the secretary of the department to determine the training and qualification requirements for screening officers. In addition, the secretary can actually exempt a class of screening officers from one or more of the requirements determined if exceptional circumstances exist. We are glad to see the government is moving an amendment—acting on the scrutiny of bills considerations and recommendations—that information be published on the number of exemptions, but we believe there needs to be much more transparency and much more information about what is actually occurring for these exemptions to occur. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting the government's amendment, but I also foreshadow that we will be moving our own amendment to provide more transparency and information on this point. Overall, however, as I have said, the Greens will be supporting this bill, but the coalition government needs to be doing more—much more—to support safe aviation and support the workers in the aviation sector. But we support this small step.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019. To set the scene, I think it's very important to reflect on where we have come over the last few years in terms of the national security of our nation and the priority that this government has placed upon the security of all Australians and the security of our borders. The first priority of any government—and, certainly, the absolute first priority of this government—is to keep our community safe from those who seek to do us harm. Since 2014, and before that, the government has strengthened our national defences, particularly against terrorism, with the investment of an additional $2.3 billion to that end. Australia faces national security challenges that continue to evolve, and we only need to look at, particularly, the growth of cyberattacks, both on governments and on businesses right around the world, to know that the national security environment is one that is constantly changing. It's a constant arms race to make sure that Australians have the right tools, the right training and the right preparation to make sure that, with all the various ways that our national security is challenged—and it is challenged—we can continue to maintain that safety for Australia: for Australian individuals and Australian businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to keep our legislation under constant review. We need to keep the capabilities of our people on the ground under constant review. We need to make sure that they are always equipped to deal with the myriad challenges that come their way. The Australian government has passed 19 tranches of legislation since 2014, when the National Terrorism Threat Level was raised, covering matters including the detention of high-threat terrorists and strengthening control orders. Our current National Terrorism Threat Level is at 'probable'. Since 2001, 86 people, including seven who were juveniles when charged, have been convicted of terrorism related offences. Fifty of these are currently serving custodial sentences, and 20 more people are currently before the courts for terrorism offences, one of whom was a juvenile when charged. Since September 2014, when the National Terrorism Threat Level was raised, 102 people have been charged as a result of 51 counterterrorism related responses around Australia. As we all know, there have been a number of attacks and a number of counterterrorism disruption operations that disrupted imminent attack planning in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment to national security also flows through to our commitment to maintaining the security of our airports and aviation. Again, top priority must be to keep Australians safe. The disrupted terrorist attack in Sydney in 2017 demonstrated a level of sophistication not seen before in Australia and reinforced that aviation remains a high-profile target for terrorists. Although we already have strong and comprehensive aviation security, it is essential that we remain ahead of this evolving threat. A range of measures are being implemented to further strengthen security at airports and at mail and air cargo facilities. These measures include new screening technology at major and regional Australian airports, increasing the AFP counterterrorism first-response presence at airports, upgrading inbound cargo and international mail screening technology, strengthening outbound air cargo screening, and improving the training and accreditation of screening staff at airports. To complement these improvements, parliament has passed new laws to give police broader powers to conduct identity checks at major airports and to direct a person to move on from the airport where they pose a criminal, safety or security threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these initiatives together, from the broad national security initiatives to these particular measures targeting transport security, obviously may seem slightly less relevant to people in these times when air travel is highly restricted. But we must always remember that, this COVID pandemic period willing, we will return to flying on a regular basis. We continue to rely very heavily on air transport links, both to get our exports out and to receive vital imports. So we must remember that all the measures that have been taken and measures such as these that continue to be taken are vitally important to the continuing wellbeing of Australians and the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on specifically to this bill, the Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019 will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. It will establish explicit powers for aviation security inspectors to conduct security system testing and will create a legislative basis for requiring screening officers to have completed relevant training prior to performing screening functions at security controlled airports and maritime ports. In particular, the bill will create powers for aviation security inspectors to conduct covert testing of aviation industry participants' aviation security systems to assess compliance with the aviation act in regulated locations such as airports, aircraft and cargo examination facilities. Obviously, in these sorts of situations, testing such as this is vitally important to make sure that the systems are pressure tested to make sure that when there is a real breach or an attempted breach of our security systems the systems have been pressure tested to the utmost extent possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will also clarify that aviation security inspectors are exempt from civil or criminal liability in certain circumstances where they are covertly testing aviation industry participants' security system, including where they are using items that resemble or mimic weapons, such as inert handguns or simulated IEDs, to test these systems. It also allows for a legislative instrument to be made determining training qualifications and other requirements for screening officers relating to the exercise of power of the performance of screening functions and to determine requirements relating to the use of identity cards and uniforms and makes further technical amendments to the aviation act and the maritime act. These measures respond directly to recommendations of the Inspector-General of Transport Security and the International Civil Aviation Organization. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Stoker very clearly outlined in her capacity as chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, this bill has been reviewed. It was also looked at by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Following that consideration, the government has agreed to adopt some of the committee's recommendations. The amendments are relatively minor. They don't necessarily change the substance of the bill, but they do make some minor improvements to the operations of the bill. They include changing the term 'weapon' to 'test weapon' and inserting a definition of 'test weapon' that makes it clear that a functional weapon can't be used for testing, only an inert or replica one. A note is inserted that makes it clear that aviation security inspectors must not endanger the health or safety of the public in the performance of their duties or the inspector will lose the immunity from civil or criminal liability. This is to clarify that an aviation security inspector could not rely on immunity from prosecution if they used a live weapon to conduct tests. The amendments will also include a requirement that the number of exemptions to training requirements for screening officers granted by the secretary of the Department of Home Affairs be published on the department's website. Again, as Senator Stoker very clearly outlined, there is also the necessary recognition of prior learning for the many very well trained and highly competent security screening officers we have in place at the moment. So this is not imposing unnecessary new training on those officers. It is making sure we keep all of our people up to date and as efficient in doing these tasks as we possibly can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again this government has a very clear priority in addressing the security of all Australians. Our first priority is to keep the nation safe. This bill is a small but very important step in doing just that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  Security of its citizens is the core function of any government. All of us in this place take this extremely seriously. Threats are ever-changing, and we as a society must continue to innovate and remain vigilant. Stopping terrorism remains a key national security concern—one this government is unashamedly committed to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who seek to prevent terrorism must always be given appropriate tools, training and powers to ensure that they are able to keep us safe. This Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019 is measured, appropriate, well-considered and forward thinking. It represents good government listening and acting. Whilst COVID-19 means that air traffic is at its most limited in living memory, we as a responsible and intelligent government have already planned for life after coronavirus. Ensuring our national security when planes begin to fly again is extremely important and should not be taken lightly. Vigilance is the price of our freedom. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aviation security inspectors in the Department of Home Affairs play an utterly critical role in ensuring Australia's aviation security is first class. Australia is extremely lucky we have avoided the kinds of tragedies we have seen in other parts of the world to this point. We must always remain alert to these threats and seek to stay well ahead of them. Criminals are sophisticated and adjust to new technology and methods as quickly as they are created. This bill is designed to equip screeners with the skills and technology needed to stay ahead of the curve. The increasing complexity around criminal activity means that constantly updating, upskilling and retraining screeners is an unfortunate but necessary reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any good government policy, this has been done in response to a well-informed, thorough and independent inquiry. This bill will allow for an appropriate screener training and accreditation scheme. This is important because quality assurance in this area is critical. This bill creates a clear standard of competency for the screening workforce. This is just good common sense. We know all too well what happens when those entrusted with important security matters lack sufficient training. It can lead to disasters like the one we have seen in Victoria. Quality assurance is critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The screener training and accreditation scheme strengthens all training requirements for screeners at airports, seaports and air cargo facilities. It creates a well researched framework for new screening qualifications. This means new entrants will be amongst the best trained in the world. Screeners will also be required to meet the national standards of skill and competence and will be required to pass annual accreditation—in other words, lifelong training to adapt to issues as they evolve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also ensure that best practice is followed when it comes to carrying out regulatory compliance activities. This is critical. All of our Public Service should be of the highest quality. This bill creates a framework for the introduction of a national screener training and accreditation program and also allows the departmental secretary to prescribe requirements for skills and training as they evolve. This is an important step, as expert recommendations and flexibility will be the tools needed going forward to ensure that we are ready, agile and capable of adapting to threats as they arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One important part of this bill is the ability of aviation security inspectors to conduct tests at locations beyond screening points without the risk of breaching any other laws. This is an important step in ensuring that the whole of our airports is able to be secure and safe. It is no good to engage in half measures around these sorts of matters; those who seek to harm our citizens will not. By exempting aviation security inspectors from prosecution when they are engaging in covert testing of security systems we are making sure our airports are ready for and resilient to any threats that may arise. This bill allows an aviation security inspector to conduct covert tests of aviation security systems at all regulated locations under the aviation act. Again, this is just commonsense thinking. Prospective terrorist attacks will not occur under supervised or controlled conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to pressure test all systems. Just as football players train to simulate game day, so should our security systems be prepared for any eventuality. Inspectors will use test pieces that simulate weapons and other contraband during tests. This goes to the true purpose of this bill, which is to ensure our security systems are as rigorous and ready for a real threat as possible. These tests will be coordinated and supervised by the Department of Home Affairs and local law enforcement. To allow realistic tests to occur, the bill amends the aviation act to ensure that aviation security inspectors can perform the full complement of their duties. To do this, they are provided with an express authority to undertake system security tests at security controlled airports and at aviation industry premises located outside the boundary of such airports. This is a sensible, pragmatic step that acknowledges that terrorists could seek to target any weakness in our security apparatus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important power granted to our security inspectors by this bill is the ability for aviation security inspectors to conduct system tests on aircraft, providing, of course, they give reasonable notice to operators. This balances the twin goals of minimising commercial disruption and ensuring that tests are realistic. Most importantly, there will be immunity from prosecution, both civil and criminal, under laws of all tiers government for security inspectors if they are conducting a test that is sensible and critical in good faith. It is ridiculous to think that this has not been the case previously. Obviously, there would be exceptions in the case of inspectors who go too far and risk injury or serious property damage. It is most important to ensure that situations like bomb-training exercises do not open our hardworking officers up to litigation. These system tests mimic possible terrorist attack pathways and probe for potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Inspector test-screening authorities are able to meet their regulatory obligations and detect the presence of a fake weapon and deny entry to the person carrying it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this bill is an important step towards ensuring that our air travel industry remains one of the safest and best in the world. As a country which is vast and wide and distant from much of the globe, it is critically important that we have an airline industry that maintains best practice in all areas. I commend the bill to the Senate. When Australians do eventually get back in the air, it will be important to ensure that they do so in the knowledge that they are safe.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I rise to speak on the Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019, which relates to the testing and training of Australia's aviation screening inspectors. This bill looks at two cohorts. Firstly, there are the screeners themselves—those screeners who you walk past every time you fly, with the beep beep of the archway and the putting of your bags through the X-rays. Those in this chamber know a lot about flying. The other cohort are the security inspectors who work for the Department of Home Affairs. They look at the training, and the compliance of that training, of those screeners. The purpose of this bill is to create a vital component of ensuring our aviation screeners are appropriately qualified for the work that they do in protecting all Australians from threats to air travel. It amends key parts of the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act to ensure a proper regime of training and inspection will exist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it creates a national training and accreditation scheme for the private industry contractors that the airports employ to provide screening services in Australia's airports. Without this sort of training and accreditation, we run the risk of having poorly qualified people overseeing vital security tasks at our airports. As a senator for Victoria, I've seen all too closely the damage that's done by security guards who are neither trained properly nor have their work overseen. The quarantine regime in Victoria has let the coronavirus pandemic spread throughout Victoria and into the rest of Australia. So having the right skills and qualifications for the work is, obviously, an important part of any security system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill ensures that the government's transport security inspectors can carry out the important compliance tasks that they have responsibility for. As you can imagine, there are all sorts of ways of testing these systems, and they need to have the sorts of tools and replica and imitation weapons that can be tested for. Without these amendments, they run the risk of prosecution from inadvertently offending state and other laws involving firearms, bombs and so on. The screener training and accreditation scheme strengthens the training requirements for screeners at airports, seaports and air cargo facilities. It creates a framework for a new screening qualification to be mandated for all screeners entering the industry. Existing screeners' qualifications will continue to be recognised. Screeners will be required to meet a national standard of competency. They will be required to pass annual accreditation testing before making independent screening decisions or clearing cargo for uplift. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with all parts of technology, everything changes, and changes rapidly, in this space. X-ray machines that are being used in airports these days change rapidly, and how they view items is of the utmost importance, as you can well imagine. The way people are trained to use these machines is, equally, as vitally important as the machines themselves. How someone views, let's say, a pistol in a piece of hand luggage—whether it is lying on its side or front-on or at any of the different angles that it could be seen from—is important in case one makes a mistake and sees just a straight bit of metal or something that doesn't look obviously like a pistol. So it's absolutely vital that this sort of accreditation stays up to date with new technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aviation security inspectors, who are part of the Department of Home Affairs, as I said, play a pivotal role in ensuring Australia's aviation security systems remain resilient against terrorist attacks. This bill introduces measures to clarify the ability of inspectors to carry out this important work. In particular, inspectors will be able to conduct system tests with test pieces at locations beyond screening points in an airport terminal without the risk of committing an offence under other laws, such as those relating to bomb hoaxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is a system test? A system test is a compliance activity conducted by aviation security inspectors to assess whether a person is complying with the security obligations established in the Aviation Security Act. It tests the screeners' ability to find goods or contraband, as they are meant to do. A system test mimics possible terrorist attack pathways and probes for potential weak points in aviation security arrangements which an adversary may wish to exploit. For example, inspectors may place a test piece, such as a test weapon—and that might be an imitation firearm or a non-functional simulated improvised explosive device—in carry-on luggage and subject the bag to security screening at a passenger screening point at an airport terminal. From this, inspectors are able to assess whether a screening authority and its operators are able to meet their regulatory obligations to detect the presence of the test weapon and deny it entry to the sterile area of an airport. To ensure that these tests are as realistic as possible at the screening points, test pieces represent items that may be used to conduct unlawful acts, such as weapons, bombs, bomb parts and the like. This is done by design to avoid causing harm or injury to aviation security inspectors, airport staff and the general public. Test weapons are not functional. For example, simulated improvised explosive devices cannot be detonated and pose no risk to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and the amendments this bill will bring about are important for keeping our security at airports up to date. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="FAB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOLAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  This is a very good bill, and one of my favourite committees, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, has produced a very good report. The Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019 is a key bill in the way that we guarantee what is fundamentally the most important thing that we do. National security, of course, remains the first priority of the Morrison government. You've heard many of the previous speakers, many of whom are my colleagues, explain the nature of this bill to you in some detail. They have given you an indication of what the bill is about. They have stated what the bill does. They have said what changes were made in response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee inquiry. They went through the changes in the bill and what they mean for the conduct of systems tests, and they spoke about systems tests in great detail. They mentioned the screeners training and accreditation scheme. They went in and explained from beginning to end what a systems test is, and they also explained what test pieces are currently used for system tests. So we've well and truly gone through the bill, and we've well and truly gone through a number of explanations of every single part of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me talk in a very general way about the bill and what lies behind training. This is not revolutionary by any stretch of the imagination. It will probably astonish most Australians to think that we aren't already doing what we are proposing in this bill. It's a simple bill, and it's a simple procedure. It's something which is absolutely essential to an activity that many of us do all the time, which is entrust our lives to fly in a terrorist environment. It's functional. It lays down the conditions that must be met before these kinds of tests are conducted. I have to say, given my background, that the military do it every single day. It can be dangerous in a military environment. It can be dangerous in war, when you still must train and you use a weapon which must be both a training weapon and a functional weapon. This, of course, is not what we are proposing in this bill. We are proposing something quite different. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Still, things can go wrong. Many years ago, as a very new helicopter pilot, I was involved in a search-and-rescue exercise off an Army training area near Tin Can Bay in Queensland. In order to 'test the system', as it was explained to us, one of our pilots was put in a raft and put in the sea and we were to find him. Things can go wrong and you've got to take risks if you're going to train well. This was not good training, because it started to get dark, we couldn't find the pilot and he spent the whole night out there in a raft in shark infested waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This kind of bill, if it is followed seriously and if the moderation and the supervision of the screeners is allowed to happen, will not result in such exercises. Going back some decades now, one of our intelligence agencies was involved in a raid on a hotel which went wrong. They were testing the system, of course. That went badly wrong—to everyone's embarrassment—and changed the nature of that security organisation. Again, this bill should prevent that kind of thing from happening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Iraq as the chief of operations for the war in Iraq, I was responsible for the security of Baghdad International Airport. The movements in and out of Baghdad International Airport were extraordinary. Hundreds and hundreds of flights per day were bringing in and taking out weapons, equipment and personnel. We discovered by sheer accident that an Iraqi baggage handler, who was in fact working for the insurgency, had decided to put an explosive device onto a pallet that was about to be loaded into a wide-bodied aircraft. What we're proposing in this bill is a little bit different from the situation in Baghdad International Airport, for the simple reason that half the people who were screeners and baggage handlers were actually working for the insurgency. That explosive device would have blown the aeroplane to bits, and that's exactly what this bill is trying to prevent. Fortunately for us, the explosive device that was placed on a pallet to be put into the aircraft actually fell off the pallet through sheer accident and didn't explode in the aircraft. The lesson, of course, is that you can be lucky. But your luck is increased if in fact you have system tests, you have screeners who do realistic training, and you can supervise and conduct tests that are realistic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2017, there was a certain amount of luck involved in the prevention of a bomb being placed on board a wide-bodied aircraft out of Sydney. The aim of this bill is to minimise the role that luck plays. The harder you work and the smarter you operate and the more realistically you train and prepare, the less the role luck will play in any situation which is critical to all of us, such as boarding an aircraft and flying and hoping to be alive at the other end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to move slightly off this now and address an issue that Senator Rice raised when she spoke. Good on her for giving support to the bill, but she equated this bill with a need to achieve zero emissions in the airline industry. Well, that's fantastic. But I just wonder, regardless of how clever we are, what will actually achieve efficiencies in relation to the airline industry and in relation to climate change. It's not going to be wishful thinking or a statement of an objective that does this, for example, zero emissions by 2030. It's not going to be by holding the view that we should destroy the economy by going to zero emissions by 2030—because if the economy is not functioning, the airline industry will certainly not be functioning. If we remove the need for aviation because we've removed the economy we have certainly not achieved an awful lot at all. We will create development in aviation in exactly the same way as this government addresses climate change—through technology. If it can be done it will be done through technology and not by wishful thinking, and this is the approach that I would recommend to Senator Rice. She should look at the coalition's technology roadmap and apply it if she thinks that this is relevant in relation to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brockman, of course, brought up the subject of national security. He was quite right to point this out. National security in relation to the aviation transport system is where the rubber hits the road. National security is not something which is conducted only by the military, the police or Home Affairs; national security is something which everyone, every element of the nation, is responsible for. National security applies to all of us. I often say that security of the nation takes a whole nation. In relation to this bill, where the rubber hits the road is where you can achieve security yet still allow the nation to function, still allow us to achieve prosperity through the market and still allow us to progress in a number of different ways. The reason that it takes a nation to secure a nation is that if we think that just one part of this nation, such as the military, will give us a security then we are going to forget that a critical part of national security is self-reliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Self-reliance, of course, is the basis of our very sovereignty. Sovereignty is critical to us. We really are only just learning, and being reminded by COVID, how incredibly important our sovereignty is. Sovereignty is not something which exists in one point in space; sovereignty is something which you can have more or less of in accordance with the forces that act on you as a nation. The self-reliance that we need doesn't apply just to manufacturers or weaponry or spare parts; it applies to the processes and the culture in your nation. As I said before, most Australians would be astonished to discover that we weren't already doing the activities that are permitted in this bill. So, when you get down to the bottom level, the most detailed level, national security depends on aviation screeners being very well trained and very capable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak about self-reliance, and self-reliance is critical in manufacturing in relation to defence, cyber and a thousand different areas. Self-reliance in this nation is being able to do what we need. It's not what we would like to do; we don't need to do everything. If we did everything we'd be like North Korea—not trading with anyone, developing everything internally. And some people call that self-sufficiency. Where we are at the moment, and not just in relation to screeners at airports and manufacturing, is that market forces deliver prosperity. But isn't it strange that the market forces within the aviation industry have not delivered the kind of security that we are talking about in this bill? Only authorities or governments can deliver security, and that's what this bill is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, this is a good bill. It's not revolutionary but it is a good bill. This can be achieved without great disruption to what's going on and by accommodating individuals. This bill is essential. It can be done safely, and it must be done, given the importance of the aviation industry to us, in an environment replete with terrorism. We should do it now, because we have a hiatus in the aviation industry where we can make change, and when we come out of that change we should come out of the change roaring. We owe this to the travelling public and we owe this to the screeners, of course, who use this on a daily basis. This is a very, very serious business and we must make it a safety business. I commend the bill. I see the need for it. I think there are very, very good reasons for proceeding with it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Transport Security Amendment (Testing and Training) Bill 2019 amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to improve the effectiveness of screening at Australia's security controlled airports and security regulated ports. Security screeners perform a vital role in securing our airports and seaports. They prevent weapons, such as firearms or explosives, from making it onto an aircraft or cruise ship, ensuring that we can all travel safely and securely.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Tonight, Labor would like to note the Greens amendments to improve transparent reporting that will be before the chamber. Labor very much agrees and has asserted in this debate that transparency is critically important. In our conversations with the government, we have been assured by the government that officials will accurately and transparently answer questions in relation to exemptions granted by the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs during Senate estimates, and these are matters that I touched on in my second reading speech. So can I ask the minister, please, if she can outline why estimates, in this case, is the appropriate forum to raise these matters?</span>

Reporting the number of exemptions given by the secretary is appropriate for the annual report. The additional information that would be required would require a level of detail to be included in the annual report that is not appropriate. The additional information being requested may be sensitive in nature and indicate a situation that may be subject to exploitation by persons intent on causing harm to the aviation or maritime industry. Should senators require the additional information proposed in the amendments, I am instructed that you are correct; senators will have the opportunity to ask the department during estimates hearings throughout the year, but we will obviously be opposing what the Greens will put forward.</span>

For example, you could characterise whether each exemption has to apply to an individual, or it might be a whole class of people that carry that exemption over a particular period of time. So can you outline for the Senate the kind of information that we should reasonably be able to ask? For example, we would want to know that it's not the same exemption being applied over and over again.</span>

Again, I can't pre-empt what information a senator may elicit from the secretary at an estimates hearing, but a senator can certainly put a question to the secretary. If the secretary is able to answer that question, I'm sure that he would. And, if not, he would state the grounds upon which he is unable to provide that information at that point in time.</span>

Now, we have had in the opposition assurances that officials will accurately and transparently answer questions in relation to exemptions. And now the minister seems to be indicating that it is really up to the secretary the extent to which they may choose to answer those questions. But in negotiations the government has asserted that the secretary will be ready and willing to answer those questions. So I'm very keen to hear from the government that you will be in a position to answer questions such as how long the exemptions were in place and not just the class of people but the number of officers to whom that exemption applied as well as whether it's being applied in the same circumstances over and over again.</span>

Could the minister outline the preparation that officials will complete before each estimates to ensure that the secretary and other witnesses are able to answer such questions. For example, the annual report highlights the number of exemptions and the classes of people. But clearly we're seeking now an undertaking from the government that the kind of information that I've asked about will be available.</span>

But certainly in relation to any estimates hearings there are grounds an official can rely on in the event that they believe they are unable to give an answer. That can then be challenged by senators, and there is then a procedure that, as you would be aware, the senators are able to go down. But certainly in this respect one would believe that it would be national security.</span>

In that context, you are therefore assuring us that we should be able to get an answer to questions like whether an exemption is repeatedly applied if the same circumstances are envisaged for each exemption. Clearly that wouldn't go necessarily to the security information behind that. We should be at liberty to know at least that the government is not relying on an exemption in order to continue to have untrained personnel doing screening. You would be able to be clear in an answer that each exemption is used on a unique and novel basis, so that we can be clear that the exemptions aren't being renewed again and again.</span>

I'm just trying to understand what the difference is. In effect, the legislation just becomes a question on notice for which the answer must be put in an annual report. I'm struggling to find the difference between the two.</span>

As I've already stated to Senator Pratt, the additional level of information that we're referring to would require a level of data to be included in the annual report that is not appropriate. The additional information being requested may be sensitive in nature and indicate a situation that may be subject to exploitation by persons intent on causing harm to the aviation or maritime industry. For example, an exemption may be given to a class of screening officers from a particular airport. Publication of this information may expose the airport or aircraft departing from that airport to undue risk. In order to reduce the risk of information of this type being exploited, we would obviously be unable to support the amendment that was being put forward by the Australian Greens, as has been referred to by Senator Pratt.</span>

But, as you would know, Senator Patrick, there is a provision an official at the table can rely on if they do not wish to provide that information, and there is certainly a process that senators are able to undertake, in the event that they do not accept the ground upon which the official has relied, all the way to a vote on the floor of the Senate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:51</span>):  Thank you. Of course I understand that process quite well. Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing at estimates where we get a relatively simple question—and I have spelt out this question in detail—and I end up getting an answer that seeks to avoid actually answering the question. That is exactly the sort of treatment we get at estimates. I am in a process now—in fact, there is a motion that will come before the Senate in the next day or so—where officials refused to provide a valuation that had been obtained on a water licence, a valuation that itself stated that after 90 days it was no longer valid and gave cautions about relying on it after that time, and was denied to the Senate on order for production and questions on notice, and yet a citizen can get it under FOI. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you have a track record—or the government has a track record—of being very cavalier in the way public interest immunities are advanced, and the Senate is actually not very good at standing up for itself. I say that regretfully. I refer you to my first speech when I talked about the difficulties or the failures of the Senate to enforce these sorts of orders. We have a shameful situation where a citizen can get an answer under FOI but a senator cannot—in fact, an order of the Senate does not produce that answer. So that's my concern. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm actually genuinely trying to work out whether or not to support the Greens motion. I would have thought that, having looked at these—and you've stated, Minister, that you don't want to support this particular amendment. I'm trying to understand where the offence lies or where the difficulty lies in these very specific questions. They're not hypotheticals. I simply want to know whether or not the officials would answer. I point out very specifically that it is not for an official to deny the answer to a question; only a minister can do that. You are representing the minister at this point in time in this chamber. </span>

The bill currently includes a provision that requirements may be prescribed in delegated legislation but does not mandate this. The proposal is that the powers to conduct system tests cannot be used unless requirements for the conduct of the tests are prescribed in the regulations. Transport security inspectors follow standardised policies and procedures when conducting system tests. Although tests need to vary between regulated entities, test types and locations, the amendments are worded in such a manner that they would not unduly impact on the ability to conduct covert system testing. As I've said, on that basis the government will be supporting the amendments moved by the opposition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Senators Pratt and Patrick for asking questions about these amendments because it has elicited from the minister no reason why these amendments should not be supported. Basically, these amendments seek to reveal a greater amount of information where there are exemptions being granted to certain levels of training and qualifications that security officers are meant to have. This legislation says that security officers should have a level of training and a level of qualification. We are supporting this bill on the basis that we have appropriately trained and appropriately qualified security officers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is a need to exempt officers from these requirements then we need to know why. We need to know more than just the number of exemptions, which is all the minister seems to be suggesting is required. I'm sorry, it just does not wash to say that we can ask these questions at estimates. I have been in the Senate for six years and have quite a lot of experience of asking such questions at estimates. I know what happens. You have prevarication. You get things taken on notice and you get the response in the week before the next estimates session. It can take a year or longer to get a straight answer out of estimates if the government wants to hide the information. If the government is concerned about security implications or any other implications of revealing this information, there is a really good way to ease the government's concern, and that is to actually not have very many exemptions. I cannot see why these exemptions should be necessary except in extreme circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments say that we need to know not just the number of exemptions that are granted but the number of screening officers in the class of screening officers covered by the exemption, so that we can see whether that number is a small or large proportion. If only one out of 100 of those screening officers were exempt from the need for training or qualifications, you would think, 'Maybe there are extenuating circumstances,' but if there were 80 out of 100 and this were ongoing, then that would be something that we, the public and the community need to know about. It's certainly something we in the Senate need to know about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know the number of requirements from which a class of screening officers is exempt under each exemption so we know whether it is just a small number of the requirements or whether it is all of the requirements that are being waived. We need to know the period for which this exemption is going to be in force. Is it just for a short period, perhaps, while the screening officers are actually doing their training and there is a shortage of screening officers and these people are doing their training at the same time they are on the job and the exemption will cease after a few months? Or is it an ongoing issue? These are all very reasonable and very important bits of information that are needed to make sure that the security regime that is being put in place is appropriate, with appropriately trained officers who have got the appropriate skills and qualifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened very closely to the minister as to why this amendment was not reasonable, and I'm afraid I was not convinced by her answer. I think essentially there's just a reluctance to go into this level of detail. All we were told was that this level of detail is not appropriate. I'm sorry; that is not good enough. Good legislation requires this level of detail being available to the public and to the Senate. This amendment will ensure that the level of information that the Senate needs and that the community needs is published in the annual report and is available for everyone on a timely basis. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:01</span>):  I just have a couple of questions in relation to the undertakings that have been provided by the government to Labor. Just to help me out, I'm wondering how long an undertaking lasts for. Does it last until the end of the parliament? Does it last until a change of prime minister? Does it last until a Liberal government leaves office and is replaced, perhaps, by the Labor Party in government? Or is it somehow enduring? How long does that undertaking to the Labor Party last? Maybe it's a bit like conventions, where we have longstanding conventions where the courts accept the exemptions and the parliament accepts the exemptions. I'm thinking of things like cabinet-in-confidence as a convention of cabinet, which the Morrison government has just expanded quite dramatically to cover pretty much everything that COAG used to do under a veil. There's an example of, if undertakings are made or something happens by way of convention, how they can be quickly overturned just at the will of the executive. I actually wonder why Labor might accept an undertaking rather than having something embedded in law. Minister, again, how long does the undertaking that you have provided the Labor Party last for?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:07</span>):  Today Labor supports the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019 and the introduction of deterrents to academic cheating services in Australia's higher education system. The bill before us implements recommendations made by the Higher Education Standards Panel. That panel concluded that inadequately constrained cheating activity 'has the potential to cause great damage to the domestic and international reputation of Australian higher education.' Unfortunately no Australian jurisdiction currently has offences aimed specifically at deterring or punishing organised cheating services. We know that the higher education sector is critically important to Australia, and Labor will always support legislation that defends the sector's integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us makes it an offence to provide, offer to provide or arrange for a third person to provide an academic cheating service to a student undertaking a higher education course in Australia. Commercial services will face both commercial and civil penalties, while services not operating commercially will face civil penalties. It also makes it an offence to publish or broadcast an advertisement for one of these cheating services, and you'll see this in proposed section 114B. We have expressed some concerns about the design of this offence and we will talk through them now. A person prosecuted for publishing an advertisement for an academic cheating service operating for a commercial purpose could face a potential jail term, even if they are receiving no personal gain. The concern among Labor is that this provision could unintentionally capture vulnerable students who are simply forwarding or sharing electronically an advertisement for commercial services. It could easily be disguised as something more innocent, and the student may not be aware of exactly what they're sharing. It could be advertised as some kind of academic support service, whereas embedded in it is in fact a cheating service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the explanatory memorandum acknowledges, these can be persuasive and sophisticated operations. These operations are aimed at vulnerable people and they often try to portray themselves as being altruistic. We have alerted the minister to these serious concerns, and an addendum to the explanatory memorandum has indeed been tabled by the minister in the House. This addendum makes clear that the circumstances about which Labor is concerned are not intended to be caught by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as I said, we very strongly support the deterrence measures for academic cheating services. But we also want to make sure that the legislation does not implicate vulnerable students who have received no personal benefit from their unintended actions. Cheating services are very well known to target vulnerable students as part of their business model. Indeed, there are a great many vulnerable students in our nation at the moment. We've got students who are away from home and family and are separated from their usual support systems and they can, as we know, be particularly vulnerable to rogue services like these. We know that the reputation of the sector is vitally important, and unfortunately our reputation has copped a severe battering among international students this year. Sadly, we've seen international students lined up around the block, desperate for a free meal, with no support from this federal government. What are these people going to tell their friends and families about Australia when they get home, with all of the pressure that is upon them to get good marks and pass as well as be able to support themselves while they are here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about an industry that provides Australia with some of its most significant export income. It provides huge value to our nation's regional communities, and it is a sector that is absolutely critical to our nation's ongoing economic prosperity. But we have a government that is absolutely throwing this critical sector under the bus. We should be a nation that knows that Australian universities are good for all of us. The minister acknowledged himself that productivity improvements in the sector can increase economic growth by some $2.7 billion a year. However, we have a government that is now sitting by and watching as universities shed jobs, close campuses and cut back on courses and degrees. We have a government that has gone out of its way to exclude universities from COVID support. We have a government that has repeatedly changed its policy to stop uni staff from accessing wage subsidies. Hundreds of university jobs in our country have already gone. Campuses have closed, and thousands more jobs are at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, most unfortunately, this is just the beginning of a sector-wide crisis. The impact of these losses on our nation's regional communities will be devastating. Universities support some 14,000 jobs in country Australia and help underpin the economy in countless towns. Across the board we are looking at tens of thousands of livelihoods being destroyed. Here we are talking about academics, tutors, admin staff, library staff, catering staff, ground staff, cleaners, security and so many others—all people with families, with bills to pay and with commitments to meet. This government has gone out of its way to exclude these workers from JobKeeper, and I am extremely alarmed at the Prime Minister's determination to abandon them. Why have this government and this Prime Minister been so determined to abandon these workers? To me, it seems like a deliberate attack on Australian higher education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Job-Ready Graduates Package will just make things worse for universities. Under this package the sector will face an overall cut of almost $1 billion a year in government funding. So much for job-ready graduate support. For students this package means it will be harder and more expensive to go to Australia's universities. This has never been Labor's approach and it never will be our approach. Under Labor we saw a boost in investment from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. We opened up the system, uncapped places and gave an additional 190,000 students a spot at university. Labor's decisions were driven by our commitment to improving Australia's productivity and by our commitment to breaking down disadvantage and inequality in our education system. Indeed, it has succeeded. It succeeded in bringing new people to university; Indigenous enrolments are up and more Australians with disability entered the system, as did people from regional and remote areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education has helped create jobs, higher wages and a better quality of life for all Australians. These are the issues and guiding principles that should be at the heart of Australian education policy. It should be a vision of equity and productivity that is funded and supported with strong resources. Unfortunately, this is not a vision that is shared by this government, which is watching thousands of jobs go in the higher education sector. It is watching campuses close. It is making it harder and more expensive for students to go to university. So, while we have this legislation before the chamber, in relation to academic cheating, I would really like to draw the government's attention to the bigger picture of the state of Australia's higher education institutions for Australian students and for international students. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:17</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Greens to speak to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019. This is indeed a serious issue. I thank the stakeholders across the sector for the time they've taken to engage with the bill throughout the process. In recognition for the need for stronger protections against commercial contract cheating operations, the Greens will not oppose this legislation. But we do have deeply held concerns about the approach it takes to addressing academic issues within our universities and the impact the bill will have on students, on their friends families and on academic communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first instance, it's not at all clear that the threat of penalties like those contained in this bill effectively deter contract cheating operations. In 2019, research from Melbourne and Toronto examining real incidents of contract cheating online found that heavy penalties on contract cheating seemed not to be limiting the impunity with which it occurs. They concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We do not think supply-side approaches to the contract cheating problem are likely to have any significant positive effects. Even worse, they direct resources away from other approaches, and they may have unintended negative consequences for students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is those negative consequences for students that I'm particularly concerned about. The first version of this bill needlessly exposed individuals such as family and friends of students to significant penalties, including jail time. So I was glad to see that revised after feedback from our office that came from many in the sector. I'm also pleased that our comments resulted in amendments to the definition of a cheating service, a definition which lacked clarity and risked criminalising or disrupting perfectly normal collegial behaviour and collaboration to the detriment of students' learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the second version of the bill—the one that is before us today—still exposes individuals to civil penalties of more than $110,000. Whereas universities are not well placed to tackle large commercial providers of cheating services, they are best placed to identify and respond to inappropriate, non-commercial assistance provided to students by peers or family and friends. This is not an issue that we want universities to pass the buck on to TEQSA, nor are these penalties remotely commensurate with the low-grade academic misconduct that universities should actually be resourced to deal with. As such, it remains completely inappropriate to expose individuals to the civil penalties this legislation prescribes for commercial providers. I do note that there's been a lot of language from the minister and the department about the supposed targets of this bill not being students or their friends or families, and I hope that that is the case. But it's easy for us to guarantee that today, by restricting the application of both the civil and criminal penalties in this legislation to commercial providers of cheating services alone. I will be moving an amendment to that effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broader issue here, for which this government is as culpable as any other, is that decades of systematic underfunding of our universities has put them in a funding situation where it is easier to surveil and sanction students than to support them. In this, we are seeing a shameful tendency towards increasingly strict monitoring as an antidote to a lack of meaningful connection between students and their teachers. This legislation's punitive response to academic misconduct reflects that. So too do the concerning reports of universities rapidly adopting exam surveillance software with little regard for the privacy implications or the impact on their students' learning experience. The use of this software must stop. More recently, the government's craven plan to strip HELP loan support from students who fail more than half their subjects reflects the government's drive to police and punish where it should provide support and help. Blame for this should be laid squarely at the feet of successive governments, whose cuts to funding have seen university class sizes grow and the quality time academics get to spend with their students diminish. If the government's cruel uni cuts and fee hikes get through, this situation will only worsen. There is no question about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own experience as a university lecturer and course coordinator, I can frankly say that this legislation is no way to stop non-commercial participants in organised cheating. Why? Because it does not and cannot address the underlying causes of students' cheating. Let's not delude ourselves that these are simple cases of lazy students looking for a way to avoid the work on an essay or an assignment. We know that pressures like the financial consequences of failing a subject or academic requirements for visa retention are often present in cheating circumstances. This bill and the rest of the government's higher education policy settings do nothing to fix this. And that's not to mention the broader circumstances that are systematically denying students the opportunity to attend to their studies without worrying day to day about making ends meet, putting food on the table or having a roof over their heads. Even before the pandemic, it was all too common for students to work multiple jobs and live pay cheque to pay cheque, reliant on meagre government support. Many often went hungry. All of these conditions have worsened during the pandemic, as the move to online learning has isolated students from opportunities to seek support and has limited academics' ability to assist a student before they begin to engage in academic misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My firm view is that academic integrity is best protected, in the first instance, by adequately funding education and training providers, where low student-staff ratios allow staff to ensure integrity by developing an individual understanding of each student's abilities in order to detect and address issues before they become misconduct. I say this based on a number of years of experience. This approach comes with the benefits of improved educational outcomes. Instead of the attacks they are suffering from those opposite at the moment, our public universities and TAFE institutions need substantial long-term increases in government funding to allow them to provide the best possible education. We know thousands of university staff have already lost their jobs and thousands more are set to lose their jobs by the end of this year. Who knows what's going to happen next year? Yet this government is set upon cutting further funding from universities and hiking fees for students. It's absolutely abhorrent and shameful. It is cruel and callous. The Greens will work to block these attacks at every turn, and we will fight to see all students supported through free university and TAFE throughout their lives.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:25</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019. We shouldn't have to do this but, of course, we do because human nature is what it is. Cheating services are a blight on our education system. There are criminals who are exploiting vulnerable students and undermining the integrity of our high quality degrees. Cheats should never prosper and, under our governance, if you sell a cheating service to an Australian student, you will face two years imprisonment or fines of up to $100,000. This bill is aimed at commercial cheating services—not, Senator Faruqi, at students who use them. Students who cheat will still be subject to their own institution's academic integrity policies and sanctions, including any consequences that flow from those. After consulting with the sector, we have clarified the legislation to ensure that parents and friends who might edit their child's essays or provide suggestions on how to improve an assignment, will not be impacted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national regulator will be given new powers to investigate and recommend prosecution of cheating service providers. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency will also be empowered to seek court injunctions to force internet service providers and search engines to block cheating websites. This bill amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011, known as the TEQSA Act, to make it an offence to provide or advertise a range of academic cheating services to students studying with Australian higher education providers, whether the service is provided from within Australia or overseas. Criminal and civil penalties of up to two years jail and fines of up to 500 penalty units, around $100,000, will apply where the cheating service or advertising is for a commercial purpose. Civil penalties of up to 500 penalty units will apply where the cheating service is provided without remuneration. Strict liability will apply to the criminal offence of providing an academic cheating service, in order to undermine services' tactics of disingenuous disclaimers regarding the purpose and use of their product. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency will be appointed to enforce the new law, with its powers to include monitoring, intelligence gathering, investigation and prosecution of identified offenders. TEQSA will have additional powers to collect and disseminate information about cheating websites and their users to help institutions combat cheating activities on campus but with safeguards to protect the unwarranted sharing of personal information about those who purchase cheating materials. TEQSA will also have the ability to seek court injunctions to force internet service providers and search engines to block cheating websites.</span>

                    </a>  No. Never. I've never seen so many people present! This bill really brings to light many different aspects of our tertiary education sector, not just its overreliance on foreign students, remembering that the minister reminded the sector only recently that their primary function is to educate Australian students and that anything else is up to them and is their responsibility. We fund the sector at record-high levels. Commonwealth expenditure is estimated to be more than $18 billion in 2020 and $19 billion next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Several years ago, a vice-chancellor commented to me that the consequence of so many foreign students is that our universities have lost their Australianness, and that is my personal experience as well. Still developing is a story today alleging that far too much openness is being provided in access to research by our universities. Australian national interests must come first, and universities, it seems to me, are losing popular support in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now for the regulator. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency is empowered to enforce the HES Act and framework so that taxpayers and students know that publicly funded universities are carrying out their core mission of educating students. But surely freedoms are an integral part of quality and standards? The question I would need to ask is: is TEQSA the problem or the solution? One TEQSA chief commissioner some years ago mentioned intellectual freedom at a Senate estimates inquiry. You, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Bilyk, questioned them on that occasion. But there's not much evidence of commitment to holding universities to their core mission of intellectual freedom and academic freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the French inquiry and now we are into another inquiry. A law requiring intellectual freedom is one thing, but enforcement is everything. I remember the appalling treatment of Geoffrey Blainey in 1984 at the University of Melbourne over the Hawke government's immigration policy, which, it was alleged, could threaten the country's social cohesion unless managed properly. As Janet Albrechtsen said recently, 'He'—Blainey—'was hounded off campus as a racist.' Blainey is not a racist; he is Australia's finest historian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think of Australian universities today, I don't think of them as places of learning where intellectual freedom thrives. If that were the concept that drove our universities, a student guild running stalls for new students wouldn't dream of banning a right-wing Generation Liberty stall on the basis that its brand did not align with the guild's values, regardless of the spin. If intellectual freedom were taken seriously, a vice-chancellor would not put up with this rubbish on their campus; neither would the regulator nor our government. The Queensland University of Technology student guild refused to offer the group Generation Liberty a stall in market week, which is held the week after the university's orientation week. According to the vice-chancellor, Generation Liberty was wrongly advised that its application was declined on the basis of its values. It might have been wrong, but it did occur and, if there were the culture of intellectual freedom, it would not have occurred. Professor Sheil corrected the record. 'Any assertion that I or the university have exercised bias or failed to protect free speech are factually incorrect,' she said. Professor Sheil was backed by the chief commissioner of the higher education regulator, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, who told a Senate estimates committee hearing that after investigating QUT's actions it considered the matter closed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, what about support for intellectual freedom in the case of Peter Ridd, an academic who was sacked by James Cook University for challenging the quality of climate science, something which is still going on to this very day? My memory is that each publicly funded university must now include reporting on their approaches to supporting intellectual and academic freedom on campus. This bill before us today is not about removing public funds. It's about cheating, which is an aspect of intellectual freedom that needs to be reinforced. But really: what about regulator? The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency is empowered to enforce the HES Act and the HES framework so taxpayers and students know publicly funded universities are carrying out their core mission to educate their students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the University of Queensland in particular might spend more time looking after their students rather than banning them in the way that Mr Drew Pavlou has been banned or the way that James Cook has appealed the decision against Mr Ridd, now waiting on a decision of that appeal. As one commentator said, even the university is embarrassed. An hour or so after the verdict, Chancellor Peter Varghese, a former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, stepped into the role of video umpire. Mr Varghese said he was personally concerned about aspects of the finding and the severity of the penalty. In consultation with Vice-Chancellor Peter Hoj, who played no role in the disciplinary process, the chancellor has convened an extraordinary meeting of the University of Queensland Senate next week to discuss the matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frank, robust debate serves the public interest. On contentious issues, robust argument is inevitable and helpful at arriving at the truth. Judge Vasta said last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the search for truth, it is an unfortunate consequence that some people may feel denigrated, offended, hurt or upset. It may not always be possible to act collegiately when diametrically opposed views clash in the search for truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives effect to the advice of the Higher Education Standards Panel that legislation is required to deter third-party academic cheating services. The panel found that the array of state, territory and Commonwealth laws relevant to cheating offences makes it difficult to pursue legal solutions against providers of cheating services. The panel's advice was that additional legislative backing is needed to more effectively deal with such risks. The panel advocated modelling this on New Zealand's approach outlined in section 292E of the New Zealand Education Act 1989. The panel recommended that legislation be aimed at those who provided cheating services and not at students who might use such services. Students who cheat remain subject to their institution's own academic integrity policies, processes and sanctions.</span>

Forty-six submissions were received in response and generally supported the need for the legislation but raised concerns about some aspects of the bill. The bill, of course, was revised to take account of these issues. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:38</span>):  I want to make a few comments about this bill and then a few comments about higher education more broadly. I can say that nothing illustrates more fully how lost the coalition is on these issues than the obscurantism of Senator Molan's most recent comments on this issue. Labor will support the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019. Labor will support the bill because academic cheating is a blight on the Australian university sector. We'll support the bill because of the potential damage that cheating can do to individual university institutions and the overall global reputation of Australian higher education. The government had no concern with the global reputation of Australian higher education over the course of the last six months, but we will support the bill on those bases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor did have some concerns about the design of some aspects of the offences set out in the bill. A person prosecuted for publishing an advertisement for an academic cheating service operating for a commercial purpose could face a potential jail term, even if they are receiving no personal gain. We, on this side, were concerned that that could capture vulnerable students who simply forward an advertisement to their friends, even if they didn't understand the implications of the advertisement or were unaware of exactly what they were sharing. The government has made changes by way of an addendum to the explanatory memorandum that does, fundamentally, deal with that issue. Cheating services target the most vulnerable students. They often target students who are here—international students—who are at their most vulnerable and lonely and are away from family and friends and home. That is the cheating services' business model. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reputation of Australia's education sector is absolutely crucial. Over the last few months, enormous damage has been done to the reputation of Australia's university sector. We had a good global reputation as a provider of higher education services with universities that had deep research capability and the capacity to collaborate with international researchers in areas of great benefit to this country and great benefit to the globe. The Morrison government's failure to deliver a higher education package and to support international students who have been stranded here has done not just enormous damage to the reputation of Australia's universities but great damage to the reputation of Australia itself. I was walking through Haymarket some weeks ago and there was a food queue some hundreds of students deep—a food queue of international students in one of our great capital cities. Apparently people in the Morrison government think that that's okay. These students were Thai students—destitute, hungry and unable to provide for themselves because this lot over here are more committed to the sort of obscurantist student politics that Senator Molan was going through than actually delivering for Australia's universities and looking after these kids. I shouldn't call them kids; they're young adults. But their parents and the universities—and, in fact, their parents and the country—have entered into a solemn contract. Our universities get paid an enormous amount of money by international students, and the contract we should have with their parents and their families is, 'Yes, we will educate them, but also we will look after them.' What we've done as a country is a disgrace, and it's caused enormous damage to our international reputation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, when most Australians saw the impact that the coronavirus crisis was having upon the teaching and research capabilities of our universities, they saw it is a crisis. But what people in the far Right of the Liberal Party or in the National Party saw was an opportunity—an opportunity to square off with their student political opponents and an opportunity to denigrate people: to denigrate the capability and denigrate the hard work of tens of thousands of university lecturers and researchers. They saw an opportunity to wreck these institutions that are so vital to our national progress and our prosperity. What did we see happen? We saw an enormous effort to ensure that Australian university staff, particularly casual staff, would be unable to access the JobKeeper provisions that were offered by the government to many millions of Australian workers. Why was it that Australian universities were specifically excluded by this government? As a consequence of that decision, many thousands of casual academics are destitute and it will be harder for Australian universities to sustain their staff and to sustain their research and education capability through the crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just when we need our universities the most, the Morrison government is in there trashing the Australian university system. Beyond the JobKeeper package, you would think that a government that had the remotest care or concern for this vital set of national institutions and their research and teaching capability would deliver a package to secure the future of those universities. There is no package. In fact, there has been a determined refusal to deliver a package that can support the sector. There will be many tens of thousands of academics, casual staff and university support staff who will lose their jobs, but the damage to Australia will be well beyond the economic effect and the effect on people's families of those job losses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look across the state of New South Wales and see the regional universities that have already started to announce many thousands of job cuts—Southern Cross University in the North Coast electorate of Page, the University of New England in Mr Joyce's seat and Charles Sturt University, largely located in the seat of Calare, currently occupied by Mr Gee. When these universities started to work their way through hundreds of staff cuts, thousands of lost student places and deep cuts to their research capability, I was quite surprised by the response of what passes for the modern National Party. Mr Joyce supported the cuts. He thought that the cuts were a very good thing indeed, and a rational response by the universities. Most people, when a local big employer makes cuts in their electorates, are opposed to them. Mr Joyce had a short career in Armidale—that's what he tells everybody, anyway—as a bouncer at the Wicklow Hotel, and he supports cuts to the University of New England there. Mr Gee, who apparently has some ministerial responsibility for education, is against cuts to Charles Sturt University. His own government is delivering the cuts and he is against them. On the Southern Cross University, largely located in Lismore, with some campuses spread across the North Coast, nobody knows what poor old Mr Hogan, the member for Page, thinks. They rarely ever do. So there is a confused position in the National Party, which should be standing up for regional universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the research capability of these universities and you look at what they actually engage their capacity in, it is in issues like plant and animal breeding, water security, improvements to rural education, economics, particularly agricultural economics, and community resilience in country towns. Mr Joyce has no regard for any of these things. Cut, cut, cut—that's all Mr Joyce understands, and it is all that the coalition understand. They have truly lost their way in the way that they regard higher education institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a sort of unrestrained dopiness about the coalition's approach to all of these issues. The idea that, instead of adopting a funding approach to universities that is all about the cost of delivery of courses, the coalition would interfere in the process of how students are billed their higher education fees in a Venezuelan-North Korean way to try to shape the choices that young school leavers make is too dopey for words. The idea that young people who want to study arts or social sciences at university when confronted with an increase in their fees will choose to be dentists or scientists is too silly for words. But it weaved its way through the cabinet and it weaved its way through the coalition party room, and what we are now left with is universities that deliver science courses suddenly having to work out how many staff they have to cut. Universities that deliver engineering courses are working out how many fewer courses in engineering they are going to deliver because the cuts on that side are going to make it harder for them to deliver the very courses that they say they're interested in more Australians studying. It is too dopey for words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've turned our televisions on over the last six months and as the television stations have turned to experts to explain to the community what's going on with the COVID-19 pandemic, how the search for a new vaccine works and what things they need to do to keep themselves, their families and their communities safe, who has been on the television? University academics—public health economists in our universities. The community has leant on the universities' capability at this time of crisis, but all Senator Molan can talk about—and I think Senator Molan accurately reflects the unrestrained dopiness that I talked about on these issues in the coalition party room—is a gleeful excitement that universities are somehow losing support in the Australian community. What a witless, dopey thing to say!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our higher education system is a key national institution, but these guys are obsessed with student politics. Maybe they were denigrated while they were student politicians by other student politicians. Most of us got over it. Most of us forgot about it. But these people bear a grudge from 1969 or whenever it was that they were last on a university campus. There is no censorship. There is no censorship on Australian university campuses. The only example that poor old Senator Molan could drag out was that people were upset by what Geoffrey Blainey had to say in the 1980s, and they should have been upset because Geoffrey Blainey was campaigning against Asian migration to Australia. Does anybody seriously defend that? I think Geoffrey Blainey is a fine Australian historian, but he was dead wrong on that issue. He will always be dead wrong on that issue, and many thousands of university students demonstrated against him. That's good; it's spirited debate. But, if your conservative views have so corrupted your thinking, if your resentment over your university experiences have so damaged your thinking about this important national institution, if you can't get yourself beyond the bitterness and weird obscurantism of the approach espoused by people opposite, you are going to continue to do enormous damage to these absolutely vital institutions and enormous damage to the Australian national interest.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:53</span>):  Centre Alliance supports the intention of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019, which is to inhibit cheating services. These services threaten the quality and integrity of the higher education sector, which has been a source of significant employment and export earnings. The bill does this by imposing penalties for providing or promoting cheating services. These penalties can be very severe—500 penalty units worth $105,000 and up to two years imprisonment. The severity of these penalties is designed to act as a deterrent and I'm confident that they will have the desired effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we do not support the other offences created by the bill, such as that which criminalises non-commercial cheating and imposes a penalty of 500 penalty units. To be clear, non-commercial cheating refers to assistance from a friend or family member without a financial benefit where the assistance forms a substantial part of the assessment. I think we can all agree that cheating is wrong and that it is desirable for students to act honestly and complete their work. But, when a student is struggling and their mother ends up helping them with an essay, is it really appropriate to label that behaviour as unlawful and, potentially, impose a fine of as much as $100,000?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every university in the country already has rules against cheating, and, for extreme cases, prosecutions can be brought for existing serious offences such as fraud or dishonestly obtaining an advantage. So what is to be gained by the creation of this new offence? Certainly, it does nothing to reduce commercial cheating services, which is the very point of this bill. The government may say that it has some deterrent value, but that assumes parents and siblings and neighbours and friends are aware that such an offence exists. There may be some media coverage on this measure if it passes into law, and so some people would become aware of it, but I imagine it would not be many, and so it would do little to change people's behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's original proposal was for a civil penalty of 1,000 penalty units—more than $200,000. In response to stakeholder feedback, they acknowledged this was excessive and reduced the penalty to 500 units. But this is still excessive. Centre Alliance will be moving an amendment to the bill which removes the non-commercial offence. We believe this is a sensible, reasonable change that will not inhibit the government's efforts to crack down on commercial cheating services.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:56</span>):  I rise in support of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill. Before I talk about the bill, I'd like to rebut a couple of the points made by Senator Ayres. It is worth noting that when students come to this country they have to have sufficient funds for 12 months. That is a part of the contract. So I think the idea that somehow the federal government is ignoring the contract is false. It's also worth pointing out that the federal government gives $17 billion in funding to higher education. There's a $70 billion outstanding debt on higher education, and universities happen to have a tax-free status on profits earned from higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I pointed out in my first speech, there were over 700,000 foreign students in this country who are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week, so they get very generous entitlements in this country. And that extra supply in the labour market can actually push wages down for hardworking Australians. I think the idea that the federal government doesn't look after international students is absolutely wrong, and for it to come from the party that introduced the Dawkins reforms in 1990, which absolutely trashed higher education—and the party that in 1989 brought in HECS for teachers and nurses, the same year as they introduced the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, which gave a 15 per cent uplift on foreign multinationals investing in oil exploration in this country—is a little bit hypocritical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for suppression of speech, I don't think Senator Molan was talking about Geoffrey Blainey back in the sixties. He was referring to Drew Pavlou today, who has very courageously stood up to certain interests at the University of Queensland. He's been demonised. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the fact that many of us on the conservative side probably have different views to Drew, we are more than happy to stand up for freedom of speech and we'll happily back Drew. Anyway, back to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it is becoming increasingly clear that education in Australia has been on the decline for the past 20 years—yes, think Dawkins reforms. According to the 2018 PISA report, education standards in Australia had hit an all-time low, with maths falling below the OECD average and science being the lowest it has ever been. Teacher quality has also been called into question as school test results have fallen, with some citing low ATAR requirements for teaching degrees and poor university results as the culprits. However, there could also be a more sinister factor at work here to explain falling academic standards among graduates—that is, cheating. It is becoming increasingly common for university students to hire cheating services to write their essays or sit their exams. This means that students are graduating without the necessary skills to succeed in the workplace, and cheating providers are profiting from this breach in academic integrity. The Higher Education Standards Panel has advised that legislation is needed to address this growing problem and deter third-party academic cheating services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an amendment to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 that will make it illegal to provide third-party academic cheating services to students. In academic circles, this kind of cheating is called contract cheating, which is where a student outsources or contracts their work to someone else, often in exchange for money. Contract cheating can take the form of a third party sitting a student's exam or, more commonly, the provision of bespoke essays or other academic material. Successful businesses have been set up to cater to this emerging market and are colloquially known as essay mills, referring to how they grind out essay after essay. According to Australian research from 2018, 2.2 per cent of students in Australia self-reported buying essays, representing approximately 33,000 students. This puts conservative estimates for the market for cheating services in Australia at between $10 million and $23 million. These are alarming numbers, and it's time the Australian government stepped in and did something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, there was a significant cheating scandal that erupted in the major universities of New South Wales, where it was revealed that students were buying essays from the MyMaster contract cheating website. Up to 70 students were facing academic penalties or suspension, and at least two were expelled. The MyMaster website was in Chinese, targeting international students, and in 2014 had a turnover of $160,000. Anecdotal evidence surrounding the MyMaster scandal, due to its publicity, revealed that the integrity and quality of Australian higher education was brought into question in the minds of foreign regulators. It is precisely situations like this that this bill aims to prevent by providing a strong deterrent, enforced by legislation to prosecute businesses like MyMaster and prevent them from providing cheating services that erode academic standards and damage the reputation of Australian education in the process. The provision of academic cheating poses a real threat to academic integrity and the reputation of Australian higher education. Employers need to be confident that graduates of Australian universities and TAFE colleges are truly qualified for their jobs—especially when it comes to positions such as engineering or medicine, where the consequences of incompetence are extremely high. By not submitting to an appropriate level of academic discipline by doing the work themselves, students fail to master the content or achieve the necessary skills to earn their degrees and sustain a career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further—and this is crucial—international education is Australia's largest service based export industry, contributing $35 billion to the national economy in 2018. Should the international reputation of Australian universities take a hit, even in part, because of these cheating services, it will have a significant negative impact on Australia's economy. Passing this bill will send a message to international students and their parents and guardians, foreign governments and overseas employers that Australia takes its education standards seriously and is doing all it can do to maintain high levels of academic integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there is no law directly prohibiting contract cheating in Australia, only indirect legislation by the states and territories in allied areas, which are often difficult to pursue and hard for a state or territory to justify prosecuting in terms of cost. This bill will send the message that academic cheating is not only unethical but illegal in Australia and will make the consequences clear, commensurate and easier to prosecute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency will be given the power to enforce the legislation through monitoring, intelligence-gathering and investigating and prosecuting identified offenders to ensure the legislation's positive effect. Practically, TEQSA will be able to seek court injunctions to block cheating websites and their ability to be found on search engines. They will also educate students about the changes and disseminate information to universities and overseas regulatory authorities about cheating websites and their users, while safeguarding the identity of students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is designed to directly penalise third parties that operate cheating services rather than bring charges against the students themselves, who remain subject to their institution's academic integrity policies. The maximum criminal and civil penalties will be two years in jail or up to $100,000 in fines. These penalties may seem harsh, but they must be harsh to be effective as a strong and comprehensive deterrent. To this end, even advertising cheating services qualifies as an offence under the proposed legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the further point that some commercial cheating providers are so successful that fines may not be much more than an inconvenience. Therefore, the fines in such cases are higher and offences are subject to possible jail terms. After consulting with the sector the government has clarified the legislation to ensure that parents and friends who might edit a child's essay or provide suggestions on how to improve an assignment will not be impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If academic cheating is allowed to flourish, it will damage the reputation of Australia's higher education sector by degrading our academic institutions and placing future education exports at risk. Those exports accounted for $35.1 billion and were Australia's third-largest prior to the devastating impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Going soft on cheating will almost certainly lead to a fall in academic and professional standards and impact Australia's ability to compete in the global marketplace. The consequences of academic cheating could also put the public at risk if graduates are not thoroughly qualified for their jobs. Cheating certainly carries significant personal risk for students. If they are caught, they risk their degree and if they are not caught, they will be inadequately prepared for the workplace and will lack the necessary skills to excel fully in their careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that this kind of third-party academic cheating is bad for students, bad for our institutions and bad for the economy. It is in Australia's interests that we act now. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANTIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:07</span>):  I rise tonight to speak in support of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019. Australia is home to one of the best education systems in the world. We all take pride in Australians having an equal opportunity to access quality tertiary education. The job of rebuilding our economy is now ahead of us. The Morrison government is of course working hard to ensure that we have a skilled workforce to support the ever-changing needs of the market. As the economy evolves we need to ensure that we have a skilled workforce to support the changing nature of the market. To ensure that we're providing skilled workers and quality education we must stamp out cheating services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Traditionally academic cheating involved the simple task of students copying from one another, but in this modern world commercial cheating services have become, sadly, very common. The issue of commercial cheating services—or contract cheating, as it has become known—came to the attention of the government in 2014 in the wake of media reports regarding the widespread use by students of a commercial cheating site known as MyMaster. The Minister for Education and Training at the time referred the matter to the TEQSA for investigation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course it would be remiss to suggest that all students are involved in these sorts of practices. In fact, the investigations that have been undertaken show that some students are more likely to engage in these behaviours than others. The likelihood of cheating is influenced by, surprisingly, gender—more male students self-reported cheating than female students—and age, with younger students being more prone. Linguistic background and the use of technology are two other factors that are reported to influence whether or not students conduct this behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third-party cheating typically involves the provision of academic material that is subsequently submitted by a student for assessment, or a third party even impersonating a student in an exam or a practical test. It is disappointing that we do have people who will rort the system. Unfortunately, the provision of these services has become more widespread through targeted promotions for cheating services through on-campus advertising, emails, social media and other forms of promotion. These targeted promotions are now being used to highlight the ease of access. The minimal cost is also a feature as well as the low risk of detection. In so doing, they do, of course, downplay the ethical dishonesty and the risk to the student's future study and career prospects, not to mention the overwhelming undermining of the academic integrity of a system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those engaged in providing academic cheating services are ultimately exploiting students and undermining the integrity of our high-quality degrees. This bill aims to stop this. The bill amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act to make it an offence to advertise academic cheating services to students studying with an Australian higher education provider, whether the service is provided from within Australia or from overseas. It also serves to add preventing and minimising the use and promotion of academic cheating services to the responsibilities of Australia's higher education regulator, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, or the TEQSA as it has been previously referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will see commercial cheating services sold to Australian students face civil and criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and fines of up to 500 penalty points, which equates to about a $100,000 fine. It does set a very high threshold. It has been set deliberately high to create a strong deterrent to those who seek to provide these services. These penalties will apply where cheating services are advertised for a commercial purpose. The bill also introduces civil penalties of up to 500 penalty units which will apply when the cheating service is provided without remuneration. The object of this is to stamp out third-party cheating that's occurred on an unpaid basis. Research has shown that a large portion of third-party cheating occurs, sadly, by family or friends, or others in the community. It's intended that strict liability will apply to the criminal offence of providing an academic cheating service, but, to be clear, mums and dads at home who help proofread or edit a son's or a daughter's essay, or give advice on to how to improve an assignment, are obviously not intended to be captured by this bill. They won't be impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision has been made after significant consultation with the sector. It's designed to target commercial cheating services and, of course, not the students who use them. But just because the students are not covered, it doesn't mean they'll get off scot-free. Students who cheat will, of course, still be subject to their institution's own academic integrity policies and sanctions, including the consequences that flow from those. It is important to reinforce for the students who are considering using such cheating services that getting a tertiary education is a privilege, not an entitlement. Our students should take the responsibility, the opportunity and the privilege of getting a tertiary education seriously and respect the obligations that go with it. Such actions will ultimately call into question the integrity of our system and the qualifications earned. Of course, in some areas of study, such as the discipline of medicine, there is a risk that these sorts of services may irresponsibly put the lives of others at risk as a result of assumed knowledge and the possession of skills obtained during these courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cheaters should never prosper under this government. These cheating services are a blight on our education system. It is currently too easy for those who provide these services to prey on students. It must be remembered, of course, that students who use the services are often away from home, under pressure, under stress and having difficulty with their studies, and the provision of these services does provide instruction that it is okay to buy an essay or have someone else take an exam for them. They're told by these service providers that no-one will find out or that there's a minimal risk of detection and there are no consequences if that happens. We know this is not the case. If it were, we wouldn't be standing in this chamber speaking to the bill which specifically targets this easy way out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency will be appointed under this new law with powers to include monitoring, intelligence gathering, investigation and prosecution of identified offenders. This body will have the ability to seek injunctions and to force internet service providers and search engines to block cheating websites. They'll have additional power to collect and disseminate information about cheating websites and their users to help institutions combat cheating activities on campus—of course, with safeguards to protect the unwarranted sharing of personal information of those who purchase these services. The national regulator will be given powers to investigate and then to recommend prosecution of the providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill comes after consultation, as I said, with the sector and gives effect to the advice of the Higher Education Standards Panel that legislation was required to deter such services. While many aspects of these services and the provision of same are already subject to criminal and civil penalties—for example, the offences of fraud, misrepresentation and dishonestly dealing with documents—they can often be difficult to pursue and provide very little deterrence in certain instances, as there is often no law which explicitly outlines the provision of these services specifically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Higher Education Standards Panel also found that the array of state, territory and Commonwealth laws relevant to these offences makes it difficult to pursue legal solutions against the providers, and the panel's advice was that additional legislative backing is needed to more effectively deal with the risks. It's actually modelled on the New Zealand Education Act and their approach. The legislation comes with the support of Universities Australia, who have said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Universities Australia thanks Education Minister Dan Tehan for taking a strong stance on the issue and for incorporating our feedback into the revised Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legislation now draws a distinction between commercial cheating services – which face criminal penalties – and civil penalties for people who help a student cheat without payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To not stamp out cheating services poses a significant threat to the integrity and the reputation of our higher education system, both in Australia and internationally, and the bill acts to ensure that our students are not taken advantage of. It also sends the message that third-party cheating is not just immoral and it doesn't just undermine the integrity of our education system and our society; it will now be illegal. For these reasons, I commend the bill. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:17</span>):  The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019 raises a number of issues. It has, of course, a laudable aim: to crack down on cheating services that exploit vulnerable students. It is aimed at seeking to strengthen the integrity of our tertiary education system. While, as the Labor Party has pointed out, there are some difficulties with this and the debate has ranged very widely, I think it's fair to say that the provisions of this particular amendment to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency are welcomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to concentrate more on the questions around our international reputation in terms of research. I want to concentrate specifically on the question of the relationship between our research sectors and international students, who are often the victims of these sorts of cheating arrangements. I'm particularly affected by the concerns that have been raised by students from China. Fees paid by international students, especially those from China, have been used to cross-subsidise the funding of research in this country, and it's the lack of a secure funding base for research which has seen so much of our university sector move into international education as a means of subsidising our research investments. With the onset of the pandemic and the consequent decline in international student numbers, we've seen this question really brought to the fore. Funding for university research is now down some $4.7 billion this year—$4.7 billion of approximately $12 billion that universities spend on research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China is Australia's biggest source of international students. In 2018, the services export market to China was about $11.7 billion. Our economy is hugely dependent on our relationship with China. In some quarters, particularly sections of the media, the university sector is singled out as the villain for cultivating this relationship. They've called for a radical decoupling from China. Of course, the criticism is not extended when it comes to other sections of Australian society, particularly agriculture or mining, forestry or fisheries. You don't hear the suggestion that we should immediately cut off our relationships with the People's Republic of China. We hear nothing, for instance, of the $63 billion from the iron ore trade that is tied directly to China. For instance, in the period from 2016-17 to 2018-19 the value of Australian merchandised trade with China increased by 40 per cent. Iron ore was the most valuable part of those exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what some call excessive dependence on China is not only a higher education characteristic, yet the university sector is attacked for that dependence while other sectors of the economy are not, and the reputations of highly regarded academics and university administrators are smeared because they have promoted engagement with China. There are suggestions that somehow there is some disloyalty to Australia if these academics engage in research collaboration with China or if they encourage more Chinese students to come here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, Professor Peter Hoj, has been referred to in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> as a 'China-friendly' vice-chancellor, as if there's some offence in that. He's been attacked by Senator Paterson because of the University of Queensland's decision to award him a performance payment. This is irony upon irony, because not only is Professor Hoj a highly decorated, internationally recognised scholar; he in fact played a leading role in the establishment of the new University Foreign Interference Taskforce, which is to be set up within TEQSA. He, of course, was criticised by Senator Paterson on the basis of 16 KPIs awarding Professor Hoj payment concerning research collaboration with China, increasing the university's share of the Chinese student market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Hoj was awarded his Companion of the Order of Australia in 2019 in the Australia Day honours list, which specifically referred to the fact that he had presided over the establishment of the Confucius Institute for the study of Chinese languages and culture at the University of Queensland. When that award was granted, it was presented amongst his achievements. The citation includes his role as a senior council executive member of the Hanban, the Office of Chinese Language Council International, since 2013. Are Professor Hoj's critics suggesting that somehow or other the Governor-General made a mistake in awarding him the nation's highest honour?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Hoj was defended by the university's chancellor, Mr Peter Varghese. Mr Varghese is a former director-general of the Office of National Assessments. He's keenly aware of what constitutes a security risk and what does not. He's found nothing inappropriate in Professor Hoj's actions. He said that under Professor Hoj's leadership the University of Queensland has risen from a global ranking of 90, when he became vice-chancellor in 2012, to a ranking of 54. That's why he received his performance payment. I understand that Professor Hoj has been linked to the possibility of taking a vice-chancellor position in the city of Adelaide. I understand that that's actually welcomed by senior Liberals even if it is rejected by some of the fringe players within the Liberal Party. Managing the relationship with China has to be a primary concern of whoever is the vice-chancellor, whether it be at Adelaide or the University of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixty-three per cent of the University of Queensland's international students actually come from China. They in fact provide some 20 per cent of the university's revenue. Mr Varghese said that the way to reduce that level of dependence is actually to seek greater diversity in students who come here. The wrong way would be to launch a sudden and disastrous decoupling from China. International student fees fund research at Australian universities, but the people who complain about the reliance on these fees have so far done nothing to provide a more secure basis of funding by the Australian government, where the funding should actually come from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The education minister recently announced that he wanted to convene a group of vice-chancellors to look for a solution to this crisis of funding within our research sector. Let's hope he finds one, because what was missing from his announcement was any suggestion that there should actually be an increase in funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inconsistency we see in these proposed changes to domestic student fees can't inspire any confidence—certainly not from me. Mr Tehan has made suggestions about making students more job ready by reducing funding for science, at the same time, of course, suggesting that teaching humanities somehow or another is improper. The proposition is farcical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that does very little thinking about the implications of its higher education policies, but it seems quite happy to acquiesce to having our university scholars—our scientists, our researchers—pilloried by its own backbenches, because it's easier to get a headline by inciting fear about security breaches. It is fear without substance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same tactic that is used against academics who engage in science collaboration with Chinese colleagues. A notable example of that is in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. A report by Sharri Markson and Kylar Loussikian names several Australian Chinese academics who have had or currently have appointments at Australian universities. They are also said to be beneficiaries of China's Thousand Talents Program, which provides financial incentives for researchers abroad and encourages them to do work in China. The journalists cite the FBI investigations into the program, and it's been alleged that there's been a transfer of intellectual property to China without the knowledge or permission of the universities employing these people. But, after insinuating that that's the case in Australia, Ms Markson and Mr Loussikian hastened to say they're not actually suggesting that there'd been any wrongdoing by academics here. You might be surprised to note that. You've got to read the articles carefully. On a number of occasions <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>this morning said that there's no suggestion of wrongdoing, inappropriate action or a failure to meet disclosure requirements. In fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>goes on to suggest that in fact what we've got here is lax regulation. Australia, which of course has stronger and tougher regulations than the United States, has allowed something to go wrong—the smear, of course, to be suggested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could find no evidence. No-one has declared any evidence of any breach of the Defence Trade Controls Act, so what's the basis of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>'s story?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again, it contains nothing but smears and insinuations directed at people who, I repeat, the journalists themselves say have done nothing wrong. It has become an all too familiar pattern for Ms Markson in reporting Australian research collaborations with China. The bigger picture is ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is: China is seeking to develop technological capabilities so that it can be a global leader in advanced manufacturing. It simply doesn't want to accept the old division of labour that has been assigned to it. China, in its Made in China 2025 plan, which was announced in 2015, set about restructuring its economy. There have been investment increases in R&amp;D in China of some 400 per cent. China is rapidly moving away from being chiefly a producer of low-cost, mass-market goods. According to the highly reputable Leiden science index, 10 years ago China had only one institution in the world's top 25 leading universities. Today it has 13—in 10 years. It has a series of measures to attract talent, as does this country, as does the United States, as do the English, as do the Germans. It's a common feature of higher education around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be naive. No-one pretends that there is no such thing as industrial espionage, but people who wish to make allegations of industrial espionage need to produce proof, not smears. There is nothing resembling proof in today's reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. More important than these confected fears is the question of what role Australia chooses to play in the historic transformation that is actually occurring in China. The continuing conflict between the United States and China is only intermittently a trade war. It has enormous capacity to do immeasurable damage to Australia's national interest. It is an underlying clash in a contest for technological supremacy. We have an opportunity here to actually participate for the benefit of Australia— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:32</span>):  There is quite a lot to unpack in this debate tonight, and I note that it has been quite wide-ranging in considering some broader issues facing our higher education sector and, particularly following Senator Carr's contribution, the relationship that some of our universities have with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I disagree with Senator Carr's characterisation that people who question the relationship that our higher education institutions have with the Chinese Communist Party are fearmongering. The number of students on our university campuses who have spoken to me and other colleagues about their concerns about free academic inquiry on campus, as well as the influence of the CCP on university campuses, completely flies in the face of that characterisation. On an evening when we are meant to be talking about a quite straightforward piece of legislation, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2010, I find it regrettable that we are engaging in a debate about the relationship that our higher education institutions have with China and that people who question that relationship and just want some transparency in the relationship are characterised as fearmongers. Quite frankly, I find it really disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will get to the legislation that we have at hand now—the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019. I think it's safe to say that cheating has changed a little since I was at university. Ten years ago, when I was studying at university, you always heard these stories of some of the more creative ways students had found to try to work their way around the system: writing the answers to exam questions on pieces of clothing, which they would then remove during the exam; eating notes once they were caught with them in the exam; or copying the text directly from Wikipedia, which, when the hyperlinks showed up in the essay, was a bit of a giveaway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the advent of the internet and enhanced communications means the art of cheating is now smarter and in many cases more commercial. Back in the day, in terms of proving an offence of cheating, universities would have academic misconduct policies in place and disciplinary processes in place and it was often contingent on finding the evidence and simply building a case that impropriety had occurred. But we know from the reviews that have been discussed in the debate tonight, undertaken by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, that these policies and procedures are perhaps not enough. Indeed, that is why we are having this debate tonight, talking about this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's interesting to note the history of how we've come to this position, because it is important to consider that universities are primarily responsible for maintaining the integrity of their academic services, so to speak. Commercial cheating came to the attention of this government through the MyMaster scandal back in 2015. That was, as we've heard tonight, a website through which students could obtain a prewritten essay. After this came to the government's attention the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency investigated this issue on the recommendation of the government. They came up with a report that suggested, as I alluded to earlier, that a stronger response from the government was required in order to regulate the higher education sector to strengthen it so that this new commercialised form of cheating service couldn't occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister then requested that the Higher Education Standards Panel advise on options to deter commercial cheating based on those recommendations from the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, which I'm going to refer to as TEQSA for ease of pronunciation—and otherwise we're going to be here all night! I would like to read from the report on student academic integrity and allegations of contract cheating by university students undertaken by TEQSA—just a short paragraph—because it really does go to where this issue has come from and why it's necessary for us to have this legislation in front of us tonight. The report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Contract cheating – the purchase of another person's work to present as your own – has a long history. Recently, the ready availability of sophisticated communication technology and the rise of social media have increased the opportunity to access and/or repurpose another's work to present as your own. Availability of essay writing services is pervasive with both local and international websites advertising their services. A number of assessment strategies have been devised to minimise the opportunity for such fraudulent activity by students and to detect it when it occurs. However it should be noted that the efficacy of such strategies has not been established and the favoured way to combat such behavior is by the promotion of academic integrity in the student body.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean, this report fundamentally explains how universities had these policies and processes in place, yet it wasn't actually preventing this cheating from occurring, as we saw with the MyMaster scandal back in 2015. So, the natural question was asked: what more can be done? The legislation we are discussing here tonight is what could be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that cheating services are a blight on our education system. These are people who are exploiting vulnerable students and undermining the integrity of our high-quality degrees. A lot of the government speakers I have listened to tonight have talked about the importance of maintaining the integrity of our degrees, because having a degree should be a worthwhile exercise and a degree should be a worthwhile commodity that should be preparing our students for the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that we're debating here this evening is aimed at commercial cheating services, not the students who use them. Students who cheat will still be subject to their institution's own academic integrity policies and sanctions, including any consequences that flow from those, like the ones I discussed earlier. The national regulator, TEQSA, will be given new powers to investigate and recommend prosecution of cheating service providers. TEQSA will also be empowered to seek court injunctions to force internet service providers and search engines to block cheating websites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives effect to the advice of the Higher Education Standards Panel that I referenced earlier—that legislation is required to deter third-party academic cheating services. Like I said, when universities have policies and procedures in place and have embedded these policies and procedures in their teaching processes and yet this sort of cheating is still occurring, we know that more needs to be done. The Higher Education Standards Panel found that the array of state, territory and Commonwealth laws relevant to cheating offences made it difficult to pursue legal solutions against providers of these cheating services. The panel's advice was that additional legislative backing is needed to more effectively deal with such risks. The panel advocated modelling this on New Zealand's approach, which is outlined in section 292E of the Education Act 1989, which is a piece of New Zealand legislation. The panel recommended that this legislation should be aimed at those who provide cheating services and not at students who might use such services. Like I said, students who cheat will remain subject to their institutions' own policies, processes and sanctions if that is deemed appropriate in the individual situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have consulted broadly on this bill. An exposure draft was issued for comment in early 2019. A number of submissions were received in response which generally supported the need for the legislation and raised some small concerns around the bill. The bill that we have in front of us this evening has been revised to take account of these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 to make it an offence to provide or advertise academic cheating services to students or arrange academic cheating services for students studying with Australian higher education providers, whether the services are provided from within Australia or overseas. Criminal and civil penalties of up to two years jail and fines of up to 500 penalty units will apply where the cheating service or advertising is for a commercial purpose. Civil penalties of up to 500 penalty units will apply where the cheating service is provided without remuneration. Strict liability will apply to the criminal offence of providing an academic cheating service in order to undermine services' tactics of disingenuous disclaimers regarding the purpose and use of their products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I alluded to earlier, TEQSA will be appointed to enforce the new law, with its powers to include monitoring, intelligence gathering, investigation and prosecution of identified offenders. TEQSA will have additional power to collect and disseminate information about cheating websites and their users to help institutions combat cheating activity on campus but with safeguards to protect the unwarranted sharing of personal information of those who purchase cheating materials. TEQSA will have the ability to seek court injunctions to force internet service providers and search engines to block cheating websites, as I previously alluded to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that last point around disseminating cheating websites is a really important one. Like I said, back in the day when I was at university, cheating was still—let's call it—paper based. It was very much around borrowing a student's notes and using another student's work to complete your essay or writing your own notes and taking them into an exam and relying upon them when you were completing an exam question. The way that students can access information now has completely changed not only their educational landscape generally but, of course, the ways in which they can be preyed upon and the access, potentially, that they might have to services such as these that can provide essays online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the bill that we are discussing here tonight is an important one. It is important that we maintain the integrity of our higher education system, because the qualifications that result from it are only ever as valuable as the integrity of the broader sector. So I certainly commend the bill to the Senate, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate around this bill, which, as I mentioned in my opening statements, has been somewhat wideranging.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:44</span>):  It is a great pleasure to rise and speak on the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019. Whether it's safeguarding against foreign interference and foreign influence, whether it's ensuring the integrity of university research, whether it's providing consistent academic standards, including for non-English-speaking international students, or whether it's combating cheating in university exams, the integrity of our university sector is critical to the reputation of our graduates, the success of our businesses for which these graduates will go on to work and the prosperity of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think I can remember a time when the integrity of some universities has been so in the spotlight as now, and that is principally the reason that this bill is so important. We just heard a very good contribution from Senator Chandler in relation to the importance of the bill. I just briefly want to touch on the bill, and I want to make a couple of comments about Senator Carr's contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011, the TEQSA Act, to make it an offence to provide or advertise academic cheating services for students studying with Australian higher education providers, whether the service is provided from within Australia or overseas. There are serious penalties in this bill for the provision of a cheating service. We are not talking about incidental help or students getting a bit of assistance here and there. We are not talking about parents or siblings giving some helpful advice. We are talking about professional, commercial cheating services which seek to undermine the very integrity of our universities. That's why there are criminal and civil penalties provided for in this bill of up to two years jail and fines of up to 500 penalty units, around $100,000. That is how seriously our government is treating this issue. Strict liability will apply to the criminal offence of providing an academic cheating service in order to undermine the service's tactics of disingenuous disclaimers regarding the purpose and the use of the products. TEQSA will be appointed to enforce the new law, with its new powers to include monitoring, intelligence gathering, investigation and the prosecution of identified offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly refer to Senator Carr's contribution. I am concerned about his characterisations of the work of our government in ensuring the integrity of our university and research sector. I commend the journalist who wrote the report in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper, because it shines a spotlight on what is a very serious issue and one that our government takes very seriously—and that is foreign interference and foreign influence in our universities. We saw the disgraceful, appalling conduct of the University of Queensland in the way that it treated Drew Pavlou when he dared to criticise the Chinese Communist Party. Of course, that was very much influenced by the university's very close links with the CCP through the Confucius Institute. But again today we have seen more concerning reports about the many dozens of academics in Australian universities who have been involved in a program called the Thousand Talents Program. The report includes information that the names of these academics have been included in Chinese patent applications in a manner that may not only compromise the intellectual property of our universities—of course, universities are reported to have said they didn't even know about this in some cases—but also compromise our national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are issues we take very seriously. We must at all stages protect the integrity of our universities. We are doing that, whether it's through the espionage and foreign interference act, through the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, through new electoral funding and disclosure reforms or, of course, through this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Queensland: perfect one day, paradise lost the next under Labor. For almost one full year—48 weeks, 335 days—the Queensland Labor government has been spinning, reviewing, back-pedalling and tap-dancing around a very simple question about the Paradise Dam fiasco in the Wide Bay Burnett region. It's a very simple question that the farmers and the graziers of Wide Bay Burnett want to know the answer to—that is: when will the Queensland Labor government safely restore Paradise Dam to its full capacity? Since the Labor government announced in September last year that they would release thousands of megalitres of water in the middle of a drought by just flushing it out to sea, farmers in the Wide Bay Burnett region have suffered through 335 days of uncertainty, not knowing when the damn will be restored and whether the water that underpins thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of investment will be returned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The farmers in this region produce 75 per cent of Australia's sweet potatoes and more than half of Australia's macadamias. They grow chillies, strawberries, tomatoes, sugarcane and passionfruit. It's a cornucopia of all that is good for you. At times this region produces 25 per cent of all of the fresh food grown in Australia. But Labor have smashed the fruit bowl that is Wide Bay Burnett without care, without compassion and without common sense. This is a very real and serious issue, yet we hear nothing from Labor's Premier. We hear nothing from her agriculture minister. We hear nothing from her water minister. In fact, the only recent information to be found is on Sunwater's Paradise Dam Facebook page. Sadly, it does not provide the certainty that farmers and graziers in the Wide Bay Burnett region desperately need. Sunwater have stated that, 'Long-term improvement works at Paradise Dam are likely to include several years of construction activities to 2025.' But even that work is dependent on the outcome of a business case being undertaken by Building Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the people of Queensland and the farmers in Bundaberg still haven't heard from the tired Labor government is what their dam plan is. How does Labor propose to plug the $2.4 billion economic hole that is going to be left in this region over the next 30 years if this dam is not fully restored? What is Labor's plan for jobs? What is Labor's plan for water? These are all questions that Queensland Labor have no answers to. Sadly, this is becoming a pattern for this tired, out of touch Labor government in Queensland. They have no plan to offer water security to our drought ravaged farmers. The Labor government are not only not building dams but tearing down existing dams. A fun fact, Madam Acting Deputy President Askew: of the 20 dams that have been built in Australia since 2003, 16 have been built in your home state of Tasmania. Labor are tearing down the one dam that has been built in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only people who have a plan to address these important issues in Queensland are Deb Frecklington and the LNP. Local LNP MPs Col Boyce, David Batt and Steve Minnikin, along with the federal members Keith Pitt and Ken O'Dowd, have been fighting for their patch of paradise and standing up for Paradise Dam, and standing up for all those who depend on the water that is in Paradise Dam. Deb and her team know that water equals jobs. Deb and the LNP are going to build Bradfield 2.0. They're going to set up the Queensland dam company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queenslanders know they cannot afford another four years of Labor, a Labor government who are using coronavirus as an alibi for their appalling economic activity over the last few years. Queensland has had the highest levels of bankruptcies and the lowest levels of business confidence. We've got a state Labor government who are using coronavirus to hide their appalling economic record. We've got a Labor government who are using base, grubby politics to divide communities along the borders of New South Wales and Queensland. Labor's Paradise Dam is Australia's largest and worst infrastructure fail. It is an Olympic gold medal, gold star, rolled gold, grand Pooh-Bah of a Labor stuff-up. There are only 67 days to go to throw out Labor, who have ruined Queensland for 25 out of the past 30 years. Queensland: perfect one day, paradise lost the next under Labor.</span>

                  </a>  There should be more of it. It probably wouldn't do the Labor Party in Queensland any harm if you repeated it. I was struck today by seeing—of all places, on Sky News—the ACTU's new advertisement that they've launched in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It sets out very clearly who it is that Australian unions represent. As the ad beautifully puts it, they represent ordinary mums and dads, sisters, brothers, aunts and uncles. The ad quite appropriately puts the focus on many of those people who have worked through the pandemic—worked through the period when most Australians were required to be at home—and, indeed, as is sadly still the case in Victoria, are still working through the pandemic as essential workers today. They are working through the pandemic as essential workers this evening. When we all go to bed, many of those people will still be working to deliver safety and security and health services to many, many millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those people should have a new place in our hearts: the nurses, the aged-care workers, the teachers and the supermarket workers. There are the people who work in the supply chains, in the factories that are still operating, the mines that are still operating, the power stations that are providing us power, and the childcare centres that are looking after our children. There are the doctors, the GPs, the surgeons, the hospital workers and the hospital orderlies. There are the transport workers, the truck drivers and the taxi drivers. There should be a solemn contract between the people in this place and those people: 'You've looked after us during the pandemic; we will look after you.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There should be an end to the quaint obsessions about industrial relations of those opposite. These are the people who recently—in the last few weeks, remarkably—were still idolising poor old Margaret Thatcher. The Treasurer of the country, in the middle of a pandemic where government action couldn't be more important, was idolising the woman who said that there is no such thing as society, the woman who sucked up to some of the worst characters across the globe, the woman who brought gifts to General Pinochet after his conviction and supported that murderous regime, the woman who supported ruthless paramilitary death squads in Northern Ireland, and the woman who, more than any other leader in modern history, weakened Britain and trashed its institutions. That's not the pathway forward for us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You looked after us; we will look after you. In this place, we should listen to those workers, give them a real voice through their unions and value them with decent wages and good jobs. I was horrified—everybody here should be horrified—to hear about casual workers in the aged-care sector who, in order to make ends meet, are working in two or three or four centres. That is unacceptable, and it has caused more human misery than any other thing. Your failure—</span>

                  </a>  I'd stay quiet, if I were you. You've had a pretty quiet day. You've had a pretty ordinary day, and your going to have a pretty ordinary fortnight. Damage through hypercasualisation in that sector, and in many other sectors in the Australian economy, has driven the pandemic more than any other factor in the labour market. I want to draw this place's attention to the circumstances of some of these groups of workers. A company called Ovato, the largest print and packaging company in the country, is a merger of Hannan printers and PMP. They've worked closely with their union over many decades, with 850 workers covering every state of the country except Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many businesses, it has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. In March the union agreed to discuss cost-saving measures with the company. A long course of very cooperative industrial relations has characterised the last 30 years. On the day before their collective agreement expired the company applied to have the agreement terminated. We know what that means for that group of people. Some of them have worked there for 10, 20 or 30 years. The purpose of the company terminating their collective agreement was in order to avoid their redundancy obligations to those workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went out to the factory the other day I met some of the workers. Some of them are owed 50 weeks, some 100 weeks, some 150 weeks and some more. Mr Gripp, who works in Melbourne, said: 'I've been at the Clayton site for the past 23 years and have seen the highs and lows of the print industry. I'm the third generation of my family to be employed at the Clayton site.' His grandmother Joyce Gripp worked there for 31 years; his dad, Kevin Gripp, worked there for 28 years; his mum, Lynn Gripp, worked there for many years; and he has worked there for 23 years. There is all of that service to that company. There is a long tradition of service to that company by Australian workers in the western suburbs of Melbourne in particular and in Sydney. They built the company and collaborated with the company. They are now going to be left destitute because of a dishonest strategy from Ovato. In the middle of a pandemic we're supposed to be looking after these people, and what have we got? A dishonest strategy to effectively defraud them of their redundancy entitlements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my industrial work over many years I met the family that's a very large shareholder in that business. Traditionally their word was their bond. They operated in a straightforward way. I don't understand why the Hannan family is allowing this operation to pursue the course of action that it has. Their word should be their bond. The collective agreement should be honoured and not avoided. If the company can't find its way to do the right thing then the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Commonwealth should intervene to make sure that these people get every cent that is owed to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been plenty more going on in workplaces across the country. Just today 275 distribution workers at Officeworks went on strike. Officeworks has been a beneficiary of the pandemic as many Australians have set up home offices. Sales at Officeworks have gone up by 27 per cent and profits have increased by 41 per cent. Workers have worked through that whole period delivering goods to Officeworks stores. They've worked through three positive coronavirus cases and continue to work safely. Instead of offering a fair deal to this group, they offered a wage increase below inflation and cuts to overtime penalties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pretty convinced that their union, the new United Workers Union, will see them through that process, but there are lots of employers out there who are not doing the right thing in Australian workplaces. Woolworths on the Central Coast of New South Wales had a lockout for many days. Their union stood by them. They have recorded a very good outcome in their collective bargaining negotiations. It's a credit to them and their union, the United Workers Union, that they and the union did something about being locked out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australian workers and their union stick together, there's nothing that they can't achieve. There are great signs for the United Workers Union with their progress over the last few months with their merger. My old union, the AWU, is going from strength to strength. We should have a commitment in this place to look at the faces of those workers in the ACTU ad. We should thank the workers in our aged-care centres, hospitals and supermarkets for their work, but we should not forget their work. We should deliver for them fair incomes and decent jobs into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
