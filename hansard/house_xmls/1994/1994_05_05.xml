         —Before the adjournment debate last night I was speaking on the government's attitude towards the full-time child carer in the home. I pointed out that there is a very major difference between the way the government treats these parents, most of whom are women, and the way it treats others. I also pointed out that whilst there is now a recognition that the cost of child care can be a necessary cost incurred in earning an income and, therefore, it ought to receive a tax concession—something that the Labor Party has resisted for years but now, necessarily, must give in to because of pressure—it has, in effect, thrown the baby out with the bathwater.

         In moving away from the assumption that children were cared for at home by their mothers—in the process of bringing in the child-care rebate—the government has put the woman who is looking after a child full-time at home into a very disadvantaged position. The amount of benefit that will flow to this woman is meagre indeed and is very severely means tested. Once the woman's income reaches $282 per annum—that is, less than 78c per day—she starts to lose the benefit. The point that we were seeking to make, which was very badly misrepresented by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), was that the full-time at-home child carer should be considered to be making a valuable contribution to society.

         I pointed out that the family allowance that the Fraser government introduced was a recognition of the contribution that the full-time mother at home was making. In responding to this, the honourable member for Moreton chose to put all family support into a general category. He then falsely claimed that I had contradicted myself in a debate relating to the capping of the child-care rebate. The government now talks about all these family issues as family support. It has transferred all payments into a welfare situation, other than the new child-care rebate. The family allowance never was welfare. It is obnoxious to mothers for it to be suggested that in recognition of the contribution they are making they are actually receiving some sort of social security payment. The principle is very clear: if the professional looking after children in a child-care centre is entitled to fair remuneration then so is the woman looking after her own children at home.

         Yesterday I pointed out that none of us have our remuneration reduced because we happen to have a spouse who is earning an income. One would never hear a union leader suggesting that someone's reward for input ought to be reduced because of income from other sources either to that person or to his or her spouse. It is quite outrageous that the principle is enshrined and defended here by the Labor government. I am sorry to say that it shows the government still does not understand the central issues of the right of choice that women—and particularly mothers—want to have, which is the right either to be full-time mothers or to participate in the work force.

         —Yesterday I tried to explain to the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) that the government's approach is based on guaranteeing choice for women to participate in the work force or in other activities in society or to stay at home and play a bigger role in the rearing of children. Whichever way they choose, the government has now put down programs in both areas. As I have pointed out, in yesterday's white paper we introduced a further program—the parenting allowance—which is going to further assist people, especially low income people, who are at home looking after children. The parenting allowance is actually going to assist 120,000 low income families by, on average, an additional $59 per week.

         For the honourable member to suggest that we are not doing enough for the people who choose to stay at home is incorrect. Yesterday she started talking like this before the white paper came out and, after the white paper has come out, she is still talking in the same vein. I find this extraordinary, because the reality is that not only did we recognise this factor but we have actually reinforced this factor in the white paper.

         There is no doubt that, through the provision of more child care and a better child-care scheme, the government is concerned to ensure increasing equality for women to participate in our society. From 24 April 1994, people have also been eligible to apply for the child-care cash rebate scheme, and the eligibility criteria are set down quite clearly in the previous act. In addition to that, there is the home child-care allowance and, as I mentioned, there is now the parenting allowance. So we reject the claim that there is insufficient provision, especially for women, in either area. We are trying to support choice for women, whether they want to go out into the workplace or whether they want to stay at home and look after children.

         As I said yesterday, the critical matter is that it is fine for opposition members to get up and say, `Well, you should be doing more in this area,' but at the same time as they say these things their economic spokespersons—especially the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)—tell us that they want to cut $5 billion to $7 billion off the budget. In other words, they talk in general terms about the need to provide more for families and more for women but then, when it comes to the actual funding of that proposal—the concrete demonstration of doing something in the area of social justice for people—what happens? They run away, as they did in the last election when in Fightback they had a proposed cut to social expenditures of about $7 billion to $10 billion.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Those sorts of cuts in expenditure would occur in the social justice area and the social programs of the Commonwealth. If that is the case, it is time for the opposition to show some consistency. Its economic spokesmen should get behind the social justice programs if they believe in them. If they do not, let us not have the opposition's social spokesman coming in here and telling us that we ought to do this and that when the opposition is not really serious about funding these programs. It is about time that some consistency was established by the opposition.

         , I have not been able to extract all the information. All members are familiar with a publication of the Department of the Parliamentary Library entitled `Comparison of 1991 Census Characteristics: Commonwealth Electoral Divisions'. I have responded on previous occasions to ignorant comments similar to those made by the honourable member for Watson yesterday. So I will give members of this House, particularly the honourable member for Watson, some facts about the Gold Coast. It is quite common for the Gold Coast to be denigrated in these terms. Therefore, I feel that it is appropriate to put some figures on the record.

         This publication of the Parliamentary Library contains a table—Table 29a—showing how many families in particular electorates have an annual income below $16,000. As there are two Gold Coast seats—McPherson and Moncrieff—I will give figures for both of them so that I am not accused of being selective. McPherson has 4,947 families with incomes below $16,000; Moncrieff has 4,364; but Watson has only 3,925.

         I now refer to `Table 30a: Families With Annual Incomes Above $60,000'. McPherson has 2,310; Moncrieff has 3,176; but Watson has a whopping 4,143. Let us look at median family income—Table 31b—to give us an indication of general wealth. McPherson families have a median family income of $27,936; Moncrieff families have $31,568; and Watson families have $35,987, which is well above both of the Gold Coast electorates.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let us look at Table 31b showing how all the electorates in Australia compare with respect to family income, ranked from lowest to highest median family income. McPherson ranks 22nd lowest; Moncrieff ranks 52nd; and, goodness me, Watson ranks 88th. Moncrieff and McPherson are very firmly in the bottom half of family median income for Australia. Watson is very firmly in the top half.

         Lest it be thought that there is a link between those figures and families with both parents working, let us look at the number of women in the labour force. McPherson has 22,388; Moncrieff has 25,838; and Watson has 23,940, which is lower than my Gold Coast electorate. Table 83a gives the figures for couples who are both in the labour force. The figures show that McPherson has 10,594; Moncrieff has 12,715; and Watson has 12,515. So it is not couple income that ranks Watson well above Moncrieff in terms of family income.

So differences cannot be ascribed to single parent families. The statistics for single parent families—given in Table 27a—are as follows: McPherson has 2,504; Moncrieff has 2,732; and Watson has 2,041, which is lower than both of the Gold Coast electorates.

         —It is a fascinating suggestion that the situation as seen by the naked eye—in other words, one's impression at first glance as a tourist—somehow outranks the facts that come from the Australian census. On a previous occasion the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) foolishly made the same sorts of silly assertions about the Gold Coast that the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) made yesterday. Later that day I came into the House and placed on the record the same sorts of facts as those which I have placed on the record today. The honourable member for Chifley subsequently had the good grace to apologise. He said that he had made an error and that he was sorry he had so denigrated the hardworking low income people of the Gold Coast. It was an error that may be understandable because people who visit the Gold Coast—most Australians do—tend to do things like take a river cruise, and they see some very beautiful housing.

         I once had the fortune to visit Miami. I went for a trip to Fort Lauderdale and took the same sort of river cruise one might take on the Gold Coast, because I had been told that the Gold Coast was modelled directly on Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale housing is very much the same as Gold Coast riverfront housing. I could therefore have come away from Miami and said that it is a hugely rich city. In fact Miami is one of the poorest cities of the United States, with one of its highest crime rates.

But the honourable member for Watson insists on being obtuse about it.

         For the whole of Australia's history, the women of Australia, the mothers of Australia, have had buckets of lip-service paid to them about what a wonderful job they are doing, how important it is to society and the enormous contribution they are making to the future of this nation. They have long since been fed up with lip-service. The facts are: we put money values on people's contributions when it comes to work. We do it in the paid work force; we have in the past done it in the unpaid work force through the family allowance which has now gone. The means testing of a family income means that you are refusing to face the principle that is so important to those women, those mothers. Words are not enough. There will not be much financial recognition for women generally through this bill. It is the principle: do we believe it or do we not? This particular aspect, the child-care support, does not.

         As for the other matters that were announced yesterday to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) referred, I will believe it when I see it. I want to see the fine print. I think a lot of women believed that the same child-care allowance was going to be good for them when it was announced. Many women are going to find out that it is not worth very much at all to them. We will wait and see what the outcome of the so-called initiative that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced yesterday amounts to.

         Additional revenue of about $1 million annually is expected from the introduction of a charge for failing to inform the department of a change in circumstances likely to affect entitlement to assistance. The purpose of the measure is, however, not to attract revenue but to serve as an incentive for clients to inform changes in their circumstances so that overpayments can be avoided. On this basis, it is expected that there will be savings of about $2.5 million a year through the identification of changes that would otherwise have gone unreported and so led to overpayments. The other provisions in the bill have no significant revenue implications.

This does not, however, require any change to the scheme rules and is therefore revenue neutral.

        This bill seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of debts arising under the Social Security Act 1991, the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. These three acts are the main Commonwealth statutes dealing with income maintenance. Each provides that an overpayment may be recovered by making deductions from a person's payments, whether the overpayment was incurred under the same act or one of the other acts.

         The bill proposes to amend the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to enable their payments to be adjusted to recover debts associated with an overpayment under another act. These associated debts are penalty charges incurred by a person who has incurred an overpayment and who is dilatory in arranging a repayment regime with the relevant department or voluntarily breaks an agreed repayment arrangement.

         —The Student Assistance Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are considering in tandem this morning, are essentially mechanical bills and as such are not controversial. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has pointed out, the Student Assistance Amendment bill extends the scope of the 1973 act by establishing a legislative basis for the Abstudy scheme and the assistance for isolated children scheme and extends the debt management regime under the act to unlegislated student assistance schemes.

         The Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of overpayments covered by the three main Commonwealth acts dealing with income maintenance. These acts are: the Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The changes being implemented by these new acts seem to be no more than an effort at good housekeeping by the government. That is something which we are happy to encourage.

         I enter only one caveat. I would like some reassurance, which I think the minister did give in his second reading speech, that where students or other beneficiaries have been found to have obtained an overpayment, they will at least be given the chance to make repayments by instalment rather than having to make a full payment immediately. I do not believe that the desperation which gives rise to seeking a loan under these circumstances should be compounded in such a manner.

         In fact, when dealing with supplementary loans we can see that considerable inequities can befall people who are forced to accept this sort of assistance. Whilst on the one hand it enables students to get twice the amount of money that they would under Austudy, by converting the grant into a loan, it also means that the most needy students end up being the students with the most debts. My office handled one such case recently. A single mother was trying to better herself and thought that the supplementary loan would give her more assistance. She thought that she was converting only half of her Austudy grant when in fact she was losing it in its entirety.

         The department then compounded her problem by giving her too much money all at once—which she promptly used to pay off debts and then had virtually nothing for months—while offering no explanation that she could understand. She says that the government offers poor students carrots and then leaves them with the stick. She advises other students not to have a bar of the supplementary loan scheme. In relation to these provisions, for example, clause 29 of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill provides:

       <para>
        But when one turns to the other bill before the parliament, the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill, one finds that clause 4, for example, provides that social security overpayments may be recovered by deductions. But on reading the legislation there does not appear to be in relation to these overpayments and the recovery thereof guidelines which exist in the other legislation. If there are no legislative provisions in the bill itself or some administrative arrangements such as guidelines, whether formally proclaimed by way of the legislation or proclaimed by way of fiat from the minister, that leaves open the possibility that an entire overpayment could be deducted in an immediate next instalment due or in subsequent instalments, leaving the recipient without financial support.

         I note that the minister said in his second reading speech that that would not be the case, but I seek some assurance that that relates not only to student assistance overpayments but also to overpayments made pursuant to the social security provisions of these bills and the veterans affairs provisions as well.

         I would like to take the opportunity to touch upon what we believe to be altogether inadequate assistance for students and particularly for students who come from rural areas of Australia. I think everyone in this country is now entirely sick of that meaningless phrase `the clever country'. It is perfectly meaningless because this is a government which does not reward cleverness. We have a scientific brain drain because this government does not think that science is important. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) yesterday noted that the white paper proposals mean that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, our scientific jewel in the crown, is to get at least $60 million less over the next three years.

         This government allocates a piffling $1 million each year for programs to help gifted children. Contrary to public opinion and a lot of popular opinion, gifted children do not just succeed anyway. They can also become drop-outs because the education system leaves them feeling bored and insufficiently stimulated or challenged. So a street kid in Australia can be a gifted child. A kid who has died of a drug overdose at 15 can be a gifted child. Perhaps the piece de resistance is that the government gives people less to study than it does to do nothing. In this connection I would like to read a letter that was written to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) recently and passed on to me by a young Chinese student who is a recent immigrant to this country.

If a student chooses to live more modestly, a $120 won't go far either. $60 for rent, $40 for food, $10 for gas, water and electricity, $10 for bus tickets, full stop. No money for anything else. No hair cut, no toothpaste, no shampoo, no Coca-Cola, no telephone, no cinema, nothing. Then you become nobody, a uni. student.

         I have been told, for example, of a Gippsland family where the man earns $40,000 a year and has five children. Forty thousand dollars is not a lot of money and is certainly not a lot when it is distributed amongst seven people. His oldest child is a clever girl who excels at maths and science. Because he earns the princely sum of $40,000, his daughter does not qualify for Austudy. The student assistance centre informed him that he should take out a second mortgage to pay for his daughter's education. So he consulted the bank manager. What did the bank manager say? He said,`That is completely out of the question. There is no way we are going to grant you a second mortgage.' Why? Because he did not earn enough money.

         When it was announced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training last year that health care card holders would automatically qualify for Austudy, many of Australia's farmers, who have been earning zero incomes for the last few years, breathed a collective sigh of relief. For example, Mari and Richard Pietsch have a diversified farm at Inglewood on the southern Downs, which is 150 kilometres from Toowoomba. They made $1,900 last year after meeting the general operating costs of their farm. For the two years before that time, they had a nil income. They have two children. One is on the land and the other is a second-year student at university. They got a health care card and applied for Austudy on 8 February, the day after the department discovered that all its literature for the past six months had contained an `error'. The health care card provision was not meant to let farmers with assets over the threshold pass through this keyhole for Austudy.

A few days later, they were refused Austudy on the grounds that their assets were too high. Mari and Richard Pietsch cannot understand why city people can tie up their money in large expensive houses or companies and get Austudy while they, with a nil income and assets that have only a notional value because nobody wants to buy them in the current era, cannot get Austudy.

         I find it interesting that honourable members opposite who purport to work only for the individual believe that the government has no role. We have heard them constantly cite the demand of their own constituents, which they believe is to get government off their backs. Now we hear constant demands for health care cards for people on the isolated children's allowance. These are the same people who opposed bulkbilling. It is quite an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy for a party on the one hand to espouse this kind of philosophy and on the other hand to make demands on this government for a whole range of services. I find it quite extraordinary given that over a decade this government has enormously expanded the range of services to students.

         I think nothing is more indicative of this expansion than the student retention rate. All of us know the figures. We now see somewhere in the range of 70, 80 or 90 per cent of students completing year 12, which is an enormous change from the beginning of the decade. While we recognise that schools, schooling and curriculums need to change, this provides an opportunity for young people to be skilled and to participate in the 20th century. Many children do so because they have access to Austudy, Abstudy and some of the other programs, such as the isolated children's scheme. They too need to be part of that wider range and also to have the same kind of legislative approaches as all of us have. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill provides a legislative framework for these programs and brings them all under the one aegis. That is particularly important.

         What we must recognise today are the opportunities, the changes, and the demands the community makes and students as individuals make upon our secondary system. We have seen some quite dramatic changes in the way in which secondary schooling and national schooling as a whole are conducted. They become more and more important as almost a quarter of Australia's school children move interstate every year. The states that are still dragging the chain on the issues of national schooling and the development of a national curriculum are denying their own students the right to participate in Australia. Yet again, they are putting states rights ahead of the national framework and national demands.

         We are seeing some quite dramatic changes in the way in which schools deliver their schooling and the way in which students are able to access it. Yesterday's white paper looks at other different ways. One of the programs it cites is the TRAC program, which has been sponsored by Jack Dusseldorf and the Evatt Foundation. It has enabled students to work a number of days a week to gain work experience and to have that recognised within the school framework. I am delighted to see that there are even students in this very Parliament House who are on that program. They are not here today, but they are working in a couple of places around here.

Most areas do have some access to learning through such things as video and television. Particularly in Western Australia—for example, in Karratha—a whole range of apprenticeship programs, modules and so on, are delivered through television across the Kimberleys.

         —I rise to support the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. This bill makes some minor amendments to the Student Assistance Act, on which the Austudy scheme is based. These amendments are as follows: firstly, to provide a legislative basis for the assistance for the isolated children scheme and for Abstudy; and, secondly, to extend the debt management regime under the act to cover other educational assistance schemes such as ATAS, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme, and to decriminalise penalties that relate to a failure to notify change of circumstances in time to allow the department to alter payment to the recipients of benefits under the various schemes. I particularly applaud this latter amendment because the legislation can in certain circumstances have some unintended and unfortunate consequences for individuals who are perhaps less than fully aware of the requirements they have to comply with under the legislation.

         The third amendment is to implement changes with respect to the repayment of benefits under Austudy and Abstudy in relation to eligibility for the financial supplement that applies. Finally, there is an amendment to ensure that the dependent spouse allowance which applies under Austudy is indexed and thus to ensure that those receiving that allowance are not effectively discriminated against with respect to the real value of that allowance.

         These are generally housekeeping amendments in order to ensure that the act has an overall coherence and that there is logic and symmetry across the various components of the student financing regime that now applies in this country. I  would like to take this opportunity to make a few comments on the question of student financing generally because it is a matter of some considerable interest to me and of particular interest to people in my constituency, because I have a very large number of students living in my electorate who attend mostly RMIT and the University of Melbourne but also some other institutions.

         I look back on my experience. I lived for approximately five years on the forerunner to Austudy, the tertiary education assistance scheme, or TEAS. I was able to qualify under the independent status provisions, which were not a great deal different from the independent status provisions that now apply to Austudy. When I look back on my own experience, I wonder how students manage to survive under the current arrangements, complete their courses and go on to play a full role in the economic affairs of our society, given the restrictions that apply, the real incomes they have to put up with and the debt they have to carry into their post-education lives.

         Back in 1978 it took me about six months to battle with the bureaucracy over my own qualification for independent assistance, and I was finally successful. For that six months I had no income and so built up considerable debt. For the next four or five years, I lived on an income that was extremely limited. It meant that I, along with many other people, was forced to live in what I think anybody would consider to be substandard housing. I spent very little money on clothes and other basic necessities. I was left in a position where scraping together an existence day to day was reasonably difficult. I survived okay. I am no worse for the experience, but there were many others in those circumstances who were worse off than I was. They had considerable difficulty putting together the requisite money to be able to survive and complete their education.

         My parents were not wealthy, but they were better off than many. I wanted to be independent of them, and I was. By this stage I was in my early twenties and was long distant from that connection. By the time I left Melbourne University I had debts to the student loan scheme of roughly $2,500, which was a fairly considerable sum of money in the early 1980s. I also had other debts that had been incurred as a result of studying in higher education. It took me several years of employment before I was finally able to repay those debts.

         This was at a time when the higher education contribution scheme did not apply. So I had no debts related to fees for studying at an institution. I repeat my observation that I wonder how those students who are now studying at places such as University of Melbourne manage to scrape by. I wonder what sorts of daunting prospects face them when they finally enter the work force, which is no longer necessarily immediately upon completing their course, and are, in some instances, faced with a mountain of debts.

         Unfortunately, one myth that is prominent in many areas of our community, not the least of which is within the Australian Labor Party—and it dates back to the 1940s and 1950s—is that all students are the children of the rich, that the kids of ordinary people do not go to university, colleges of advanced education or their modern day equivalents and that, therefore, any notions of assistance to students means that ordinary workers are subsidising the children of the rich. When we look at the statistics—the origins of people who attended higher education institutions; the geographic and demographic distribution of those people; and the relatively small numbers of those people—we see that there was probably a fair amount of truth in that observation back in the 1950s. But it certainly is no longer the case now.

         There is still something of a bias towards people from professional backgrounds. But we now have over 500,000 people in the higher education system, and a large number of them are from very ordinary and average backgrounds. A change in mind-set has become increasingly important within the public affairs of this nation to recognise that we are no longer dealing with institutions that cater for the children of the rich.

         I add that, regardless of whatever other criticisms I may have of policy with respect to student financing in higher education, it certainly is to the government's great credit that the number of people in higher education has almost doubled in the 11 years that this government has been in office. The other point about the class origins of people in higher education is that, by and large, people from rich backgrounds do not qualify for assistance through schemes such as Austudy. There are some fancy mechanisms that people from well-off backgrounds can manage to qualify for because their parents are self-employed and can get them independent status perhaps when they should not, but they will always be a tiny minority. Efforts are always made to prevent that sort of thing from occurring. By and large, people from wealthy backgrounds do not qualify for the assistance. The assistance goes where it is needed.

         The problem we now have, which is very clearly linked to the unemployment circumstances that yesterday's white paper is targeted towards, is that a recent investigation by the Australian Government Actuary found that 16 1/2 per cent of graduates would be unlikely to ever pay off their HECS debts and that the Commonwealth should write off approximately $376 million of HECS debts as bad debts. Degrees are no longer the automatic meal ticket that they once were for many people. For example, approximately half of law graduates are now unemployed six months after having completed their course. When I completed my law course, there was no consideration as to whether or not we would get a job. The consideration related to what sort of job we would get. That has changed even in an elite area such as law. It is doubly the case in some of the less prestigious courses offered in higher education institutions.

         We are no longer talking about a gravy train that is there to provide people with huge incomes for the rest of their lives. Higher education will provide that for some but, for a growing majority, higher education will simply be a ticket to a relatively ordinary, average paid job in the work force eventually. That ought to be acknowledged in the structure of the higher education contribution scheme.

         The justification for HECS that graduates are an economically privileged group and, therefore, that they should pay directly through their contribution for the source of that privilege is substantially weaker now than it was in the mid-1980s. It is still there to some extent, but it is questionable as to how much notice one should take of that.

         There are a number of weaknesses in the current Austudy arrangements. The most obvious is that Austudy payments are significantly less than unemployment benefits. Students often have more costs. I agree that people who are unemployed have substantial costs due to jobsearch activities and the like, but students often also have substantial costs that are not covered by Austudy arrangements. For example, one of my constituents is undertaking a textile design course. She is very highly motivated, but she has been having financial difficulties. She is having extreme problems finding the roughly $1,000 a year that she needs to pay for materials, such as paints, that are relevant to her course. These are the sorts of things that many students have to deal with on an income that is lower than the unemployment benefit.

         There is an obvious disincentive for people who are unemployed to return to study when the Austudy payment is lower. As the pot of gold is no longer at the end of the rainbow, as I have indicated, that disincentive is now magnified with the doubt as to whether going back to study and completing a degree, a diploma or whatever will substantially enhance that person's employability. That clearly is a problem that we need to address. Having incentives for people to upgrade their skills and get further qualifications to become more employable is obviously critically important to the employment prospects of people in this country. It is something that was central to the white paper released yesterday.

I see people who are very motivated and committed to performing well, getting their degrees and going onto bigger and better things, but who are literally struggling to pay the rent and afford the basic necessities of life. I ask the government to pay some serious attention to trying to lift the level of Austudy. The guidelines for independent Austudy are still too tight, particularly in a period of high unemployment. Many students who do not get parental support and who are genuinely independent of their parents are unable to qualify.

I applaud wholeheartedly the initiative in yesterday's white paper which provides people who are eligible for unemployment benefits with the opportunity to receive up to $500 or $1,000 in advance in order to allow them to pay, effectively, start-up costs, such as costs for tools and materials. This initiative provides yet another gap between the effective level of unemployment benefits assistance and Austudy.

         These problems are also exacerbated by the rapid and unregulated growth of fees on many campuses. It is extremely disturbing to see that some vice-chancellors have been promoting the notion that domestic students should be able to buy their way into our higher education institutions by paying full fees, even if their secondary education results do not qualify them. This totally misconceives the nature of the overseas student intake that occurs in Australian higher education. That notion would allow us to return not only to the bad old days but to worse than the bad old days because it would create a situation where people could actually get preference of position in higher education according to their parents' income, according to their wealth, rather than according to their academic merit. The tiny enrolments in private higher education institutions, such as Bond University, tend to suggest that there really is not much of a demand for this type of provision anyway. But that may not necessarily remain the case once we allow it to happen.

Unlike some in this place, I do not back away from supporting the Whitlam government's reforms in many areas, none the least being in the area of higher education. As far as I am concerned, when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said to the media that the white paper is a Whitlamite adventure, he could pay no greater compliment to yesterday's white paper. Not everybody in the Labor Party thinks like that but I thank the Leader of the Opposition, and may he give us more compliments of that nature.

Yes, it has acted as a disincentive for some people to enter into or to continue in higher education but nowhere near to the extent that I feared. But I would make that concession. I would also concede that HECS has provided a significant part of the funding necessary to ensure the massive expansion of higher education that has occurred in this country. Therefore, I fear that extensions of HECS, changes to HECS, could have those effects. I would much prefer to hold the line where it is although, as I have indicated, I feel that there is considerable scope for changes to Austudy.

         The loan supplement that was introduced to Austudy a couple of years ago should be either substantially altered or abolished. This is because, in effect, students who are able to get a bank loan would be better off getting their full Austudy and the bank loan to take them up to the total amount available under the loan scheme plus a truncated Austudy. I am afraid that that is—and I hope the minister pardons me for saying this—something like the service that Waltons used to offer. I really think that we should have a close look at that scheme.

         What worries me with students and debt—and it is something that has not been studied, to the best of my knowledge—is that the level of debts that many students are now taking into their post-education lives must be having an effect on their economic decisions.

         I would like to finally comment on another problem—and the shadow minister probably will stop nodding when I say these things—which has recently surfaced in the states of Victoria and Western Australia, which also impacts on the ability of students to conduct their ordinary affairs and live a reasonable life and so forth while they are studying: the push to introduce voluntary student unionism. I speak with particular reference to the Kennett government's legislation which is basically designed to attack organisations that the Liberal Party sees as sources of political opposition. It has been dressed up in all sorts of civil liberties garb and stuff about rights of voluntary association and the like. In reality it is about trying to knock off organisations that generally speaking are run by people on the left of the political spectrum, but not always. Probably 20 per cent or 30 per cent, maybe more, of Australian student unions would be run at the moment by people on the right of the political spectrum, but generally a majority have been run by people on the left of the spectrum and that is what the Liberal Party and Jeff Kennett do not like.

         Voluntary student unionism will force up the costs of many ordinary student services that students, particularly lower income students, rely on—such as student catering services that are subsidised. The higher costs resulting from the pursuit of an obscure ideological obsession that really relates to nothing other than political advantage for the Liberal Party would add yet another financial burden on the students. That has been shown by recent internal documents from the Liberal Party which indicate quite clearly that that is what the agenda is. In answer to a question I raised in this House a couple of months ago, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) referred to a leaflet which gave a Liberal Party phone number as a return phone number for students for voluntary student unionism. It is quite clear what the campaign is about.

         I have participated in ballots with students at Melbourne university about voluntary student unionism. An overwhelming majority—two-thirds or thereabouts—supported compulsory student unionism. That was some time ago but I venture to suggest that equivalent ballots now would produce the same result. We also see that, through legislation, Victoria is deciding that certain activities currently done by student organisations can be the subject of compulsory fees without membership and without rights of representations, and certain activities cannot. The classic contrast can be drawn between sport and theatre. Student sport can and will be the subject of a compulsory levy which people who have no interest in sport will have to pay, but student theatre cannot be because student theatre has to be voluntary. This may give us cause to reflect on the philistine nature of the Kennett government, but it does indicate that we have a totally arbitrary basis for deciding that certain compulsorily levied fees for certain events and certain activities are okay and others are not.

         I would remind the honourable member for Menzies that this year our government will contribute $3 billion to school education. That is something that we are proud of. It is an unprecedented amount that is being expended by a federal government on school education, and I would ask him to compare that to the record of the Kennett government in Victoria in particular and the Greiner-Fahey government in New South Wales and what their effect has been on delivering school services in those two states. Over the past 12 months in Victoria, and a longer period in New South Wales, we have seen an unprecedented attack on school education by those governments. When I talk about school education there, I talk about state education: the delivery of educational services to the ordinary children, the ordinary people of Australia.

         Having been a teacher for some 30 years in the school education system of New South Wales, I know that children in remote areas, in country schools, are not taught at any less a level than those at any other school. As a matter of fact, the last school I taught in has an enviable record of regularly producing top students from the Hunter region. It consistently gets students into the top hundred of the higher school certificate in New South Wales. That is what can happen when there is a commitment from the staff to do their job.

         Over the last couple of months I have had the pleasure of attending the openings of school facilities. At Maitland High School, formerly Maitland Boys High School, I had the pleasure of being present when a facility, towards which this government contributed $760,000, was opened by the state minister, although of course she did not have the courtesy to invite the federal minister to attend. The state government did not contribute as much as the federal government did, but it insisted on the right to open that facility. Then, only a couple of weeks ago, I attended the extensions to Dungog High School, to which the federal government had contributed $600,000. In a couple of weeks time, I know that the federal minister will be present in my electorate to open a science laboratory, which has been fully funded by the federal government, at the Hunter Valley Grammar School. In a couple of weeks, I personally will be opening a new home science facility, which has been funded by the federal government, at the Bulahdelah Central School. They are initiatives of which we are proud. Of course, when we extrapolate the openings of new facilities from all over the country, it indicates our contribution to school education.

         I do not want to be chastened for not debating the legislation before us, so let me get back to the topic. Essentially, the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill is about administrative management. It seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of overpayments of benefits under the Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It sometimes happens that a person has incurred a debt to the Commonwealth under one income maintenance act but is receiving an entitlement under another. The Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act all need amendments so that overpayments by one department can be recovered by another. This means, in effect, that if, say, a person has received an overpayment of Austudy or any other benefits under the Student Assistance Act, including a late payment charge, and then is receiving some maintenance from Social Security, those overpayments can be deducted from his or her social security benefits; and vice versa. The same applies to overpayments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In other words, debts will be portable.

         The legislation is a means of recovering debts from people's failure to repay. It is only proper that the Commonwealth should have this right of recovery, just as the private sector does. It is important from an administrative point of view that the majority of these clauses of the legislation commence on 1 July this year. This means that a satisfactory lead time for procedures can be put in place for the new recovery arrangements.

         I am sure that no honourable member of this House will dispute the need for such measures. Debts to the Commonwealth arising from income maintenance overpayments amount to about $1 million in a full financial year. Only about 72 per cent of Austudy-Abstudy overpayments are currently recovered, and this is a significant amount.

         However, there is also the principle involved of personal responsibility, of personal accountability. I am sure that many persons who find themselves in the situation of having received overpayments—and it is not always their fault; they do not do it consciously—will welcome the opportunity for repayments that are managed for them in a mutually satisfactory way. We are not talking about a hard-hearted government with a Shylock mentality. Government agencies will negotiate with the person who has incurred the debt to work out mutually suitable repayment arrangements. After consultation, repayments will be tailored to individual needs.

         The Student Assistance Amendment Bill proposes to extend significantly the scope of the Student Assistance Act 1973 which provides the basis for the Austudy scheme and the Austudy-Abstudy supplement. It also provides a debt management regime for unlegislated student assistance schemes. It is proposed that applicants for assistance under the Abstudy and assistance for isolated children scheme will be able to seek a review of departmental assessments by appealing to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It will also extend the debt management regime which I have outlined previously to include the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and the vocational and educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. Debts incurred through overpayments of the Austudy-Abstudy scheme under a stay order of the AAT, or a court, or under the Data-Matching Act will now be recoverable.

         I am also pleased to note that the legislation encompasses several commonsense changes. The dependent spouse allowance under Austudy will be indexed in line with changes to the CPI. Also, where currently it is an offence for a person who has been receiving Austudy and has had a change to his or her circumstances to fail to notify the department within seven days, it is now proposed to decriminalise this offence. A charge of $10 a week will be substituted. It is also proposed to extend the period from seven to 14 days. I am pleased to note that the minister will be able to issue guidelines for departmental officers to follow when they are deciding whether students who have obtained a supplement loan by fraud should have to repay it immediately rather than under the HECS type arrangements.

         It will also be clarified that it is an offence if a person knowingly receives student assistance to which he or she is not entitled. The taxable income thresholds for the compulsory repayment of financial supplement debts will be varied so that they are equivalent to the thresholds of the higher education contribution scheme. The total amount of financial supplement payable to a student will be reduced where the student requests a lesser amount of financial supplement or where there is a reduction in the amount for which the student is eligible.

         The financial impact of these measures may not be considered great. A saving of about $2.5 million in the first year is anticipated, and other changes do not involve additional expenditure. However, the saving of $2.5 million, added to the accountability and the responsibility of the individuals, I think is the underlying concept of these proposed changes. The indexing of the dependent spouse allowance involves no additional expenditure under the act, and the establishing of the Abstudy scheme and assistance for isolated children scheme on a legislated basis are revenue neutral.

It is enshrined in the principle of social justice and equity of offering a helping hand to our fellow Australians when they need it. The Veterans' Entitlements Act, passed in 1986, affirmed our commitment to the members of our ex-service community and their dependants. Subsequent federal budgets have continued to improve the range and quality of services to our veterans as a continuing recognition of a debt that can never fully be repaid.

         —In closing the debate, I thank those who took part. It was quite a wide ranging debate when one considers that we are dealing with bills which are fairly specific in their intention. I will resist the temptation to discuss the higher education contribution scheme, Austudy supplement or Austudy in general. I will resist the temptation to talk about voluntary student unionism and even the new schools in the Hunter Valley, of which the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) is obviously so proud.

         Two matters raised by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) are relevant to the bills. On the question of repayment of debt by instalment, I am happy to confirm that the rate of instalment can be adjusted to suit the means of the particular person involved. Secondly, the honourable member for Menzies expressed some concern about the administration of debt recovery, given that we are dealing with a number of different acts here. The administration of debt recovery will be different, of course, because it is under different legislation. Officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, for example, will be using tabled guidelines under the Student Assistance Act. The Department of Social Security operates under secretaries guidelines issued under the Social Security Act.

         The honourable member for Menzies should take comfort from what was said in the second reading speech on the reciprocal recovery legislation, which makes it clear that the rationalisation of debt recovery provisions in the bill will not be leading to an increase in the level of deductions from a person's payment. In other words, the government is quite aware of the need to balance a debtor's need for adequate income maintenance with his responsibility to pay debts due to the Commonwealth as expeditiously as possible. Notwithstanding that, yes, there will be different administrative regimes.

         I should deal with some of the other remarks of the honourable member for Menzies, who took the opportunity to chide the government for what he regarded as lack of achievement of the objectives encapsulated in the phrase `the clever country'. I admire the capacity of the honourable member for Menzies to attack the government in such a way without blushing. Certainly he was a fine lawyer; he is obviously a fine member of the opposition if he can attack the government on its achievements in education and not blush at the same time.

         I take this opportunity to remind the honourable member for Menzies and the House that when the government came to office in 1983 around one in three young Australians completed full secondary education through to year 12. Last year, it was a little under 80 per cent. Secondary retention rates have risen to an outstanding extent over the period that this government has been in office. Equally, I should remind him, as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) did during his contribution, of the outstanding expansion in the higher education area that has occurred during the period that this government has been in office.

         When we took office there were around 16 universities in this country, mainly in capital cities, to cater for a relatively small undergraduate population, dealing with those relatively few youngsters who went on to complete a full secondary education. We have revolutionised the higher education system during our period in government. The unified national system now has something like 38 member universities across the country. The undergraduate population has expanded to a very large extent and universities are now to be found across the country, not just largely in capital cities.

         The honourable member for Menzies also really ought to understand what the government has achieved and what it has in mind in the vocational education and training sector. The commitment over a four-year period of an additional $1.1 billion from the government in growth funds will enable us to build a first-class vocational education and training system in this country, allowing us to develop the skills in our own population that we will need as the recovery continues.

         I can remember the recovery of the early 1980s. As the recovery from the recession, induced by the former government, gathered pace, skills were simply not available for industry. As a result, this country had to use migration programs to import skills. With the development of the first-class vocational education and training system in this country, with a commitment of resources like $1.1 billion provided by this government in additional growth money, we have the opportunity to develop those skills among our own population. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it quite clear in his statement on the white paper yesterday and in his remarks this morning that this is an important objective of the white paper program.

         Certainly some of the political colleagues of the honourable member for Menzies in the Victorian government understand the importance of this, so much so that they are anxious to take credit for some of this additional Commonwealth money in their own economic statement, which was tabled in the Victorian parliament last week. In that statement the Victorian government claimed some $80 million of Commonwealth TAFE capital as its own. I certainly understand that it shares our objectives, so much so that it wants to claim our expenditure as its own. People, including the honourable member for Menzies, ought to understand that the TAFE system of the 1990s is certainly not the TAFE system of the 1960s or 1970s. It is a first-class system offering a range of opportunities that were simply not available a decade or two ago.

         The honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Melbourne both treated us to some interesting anecdotal evidence on student assistance. I should point out to both the honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Melbourne that the question of aligning rates is something that has concerned the government for some time. It is not an easy set of problems because allowances are paid to different people for different purposes. On the one hand, unemployment benefit is intended to be assistance, for a limited term, to people out of work in the job search activity. Student assistance, on the other hand, is to provide assistance over the period of a course, taking into account family income and assets, essentially to give that student the capacity to undertake further study.

         The Commonwealth student assistance schemes have provided over $1 1/2 billion this year to more than half a million students and the system has grown over 10 years or so. The government at the time of the early 1980s, for example, spent around $300 million on student assistance under a scheme which was certainly more complex than the present one.

         The contrast drawn between the unemployed person over 21 and the over 21-year-old full-time student is the kind of contrast that students will often offer. Almost universally they will not mention that their capacity for part-time earnings is much greater under Austudy. They will not say that their capacity for earning without affecting benefits during university vacations is much greater than that of those on unemployment benefits, nor very often will they tell about their access to the Austudy supplement, which is a very good option for some students who might choose to use that to obtain funds for up-front purposes such as those as described by the honourable member for Melbourne.

         I found the case of the father of five on an income of $40,000 interesting. I would be happy to look at the details that the honourable member for Menzies has outlined. We should all be aware that the cut-off point for a student living away from home is $42,487 before one takes into account deductions for other children. The deduction for the first child is $1,200, $2,500 for the next and $3,700 for children 16 or over. On the face of it, I would have thought that the family which the honourable member for Menzies described would have an entitlement under Austudy. As I say, I would be happy to look at the details. I would be surprised if the student assistance centre actually offered the kind of advice that the person writing to him has suggested he received.

         Finally, the honourable member for Menzies has used the debate and his amendment as an opportunity to make a point about access to Austudy under the health care card. I remind him that it is a fiction to say—and it is a fiction that has been repeated in this House this morning and on other occasions—that it was ever the intention of the government to waive the Austudy assets test for any particular group of applicants. The situation arose as a result of a misinterpretation of the government system, and it was unfortunately repeated in a number of documents. It was not the government's intention to waive the assets test for farming families holding the health care card. The honourable member would be aware that already a generous assets test concession applies to farming and small business families. It allows a 50 per cent discounting of assets and, therefore, enables farmers to have assets of around three-quarters of a million dollars before withdrawal of assistance.

         The government will not be accepting the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Menzies. Again, I commend him for raising this matter in such an unblushing manner. I say `unblushing' because no doubt he was at the occasion of the burial of Fightback at the Eagle Hawk motel a couple of weekends ago. He should remember that, had the opposition formed government in March last year and been on this side of the House now, under Fightback it would probably be legislating to remove $30 million from student assistance schemes. It would probably be now in the process of removing student assistance from some 30,000 students. Fightback proposed that some 30,000 students would lose Austudy, ripping $30 million out of the scheme. It is not a bad effort for the honourable member for Menzies to come in here and unblushingly complain about 20 individuals who have been inconvenienced when, at the same time, he knows that the opposition has just disposed of a policy that would have removed student assistance from 30,000 students.

         The waterfront reform program was based on an in-principle agreement, IPA, negotiated between the government, stevedoring employers, unions and the ACTU, and implemented over a three-year period from October 1989 to October 1992, under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. As part of the reform of the industry framework, the IPA called for the restructuring of awards and agreements. A new award, the stevedoring industry award, was ratified in November 1991. The award included a skills-based classification structure which saw the former `waterside worker' classification replaced by `stevedoring employee', together with a wider definition of stevedoring operations.

The special levy will continue to be collected and applied to meet the industry's loan obligation until that obligation is fulfilled.

         The committee is currently required to maintain registers of waterside workers consistent with the General Agreement of 1977 between stevedoring employers and the union (now Maritime Union of Australia). These provisions were part of the industry-based employment arrangements which characterised the industry prior to the reform program. The provision for registers was also relevant to meeting Australia's obligations in relation to ILO convention 137. At the completion of the reform program, all parties agreed that the registration system incorporated in the General Agreement of 1977 would cease to apply. The bill removes the requirement that the committee maintain a register of waterside workers for these purposes and in relation to levy collection, although the committee will establish a register of names of stevedoring employees, consistent with the convention.

         It is supremely ironic that the House should be debating a bill dealing with industrial relations only a day after the government's employment statement. The government has invested an enormous amount of the political and economic capital of the nation in the employment white paper that was brought down yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The government would have us believe that this represents a revisiting of earlier days when a former Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, produced a white paper in favour of full employment. The government has committed billions of dollars towards an attempted solution of Australia's chronic unemployment problem. Yet almost unnoticed, almost silently as if deliberately by design, the government has been changing the industrial relations laws of this country in a way that makes unemployment likely to rise rather than fall, in a way that is likely to further complicate the workplace rules that prevent small employers taking on new staff, in a way that entrenches the rigidities of Australia's already very rigid industrial relations system.

         The broad fact is that Australia has one of the worst unemployment levels in the industrialised world. I heard the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), in his response to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), talk about the capacity of the honourable member for Menzies to make allegations against the government without blushing. I never cease to be amazed at the capacity of the Prime Minister, in particular, to make claims about Australia's unemployment performance, to make claims about what his government has done to tackle that problem, without blushing. He would have us believe that we are like the rest of the world when it comes to unemployment. That, of course, is not true.

         The Prime Minister would have to be the most selectively comparing Prime Minister this country has ever had. When it suits him, the countries that he compares Australia with are the dynamic economies of the Asian Pacific region. When it suits one purpose that is what he does. When it suits another purpose, he would compare us with the countries of Europe and of North America. When it comes to unemployment, we never hear the Prime Minister comparing Australia with the United States or with Japan. He says, `Our unemployment problem is like everybody else's.' It is not. The Americans have an unemployment level of 6 1/2 per cent. When we bear in mind the enormous urban underclass that the United States has in its major cities, particularly in the north east, we have an idea of how much better the Americans are doing with unemployment than we are.

         One of the reasons the Americans do better with unemployment is that they have a far more flexible labour market. They have a capacity to regenerate and to come back and to recover. Because of the flexibility of the American labour market, when economic recovery begins, it is not the government that reaches back and picks up the people—it is the private business sector of the American economy that reaches back and picks up the people. The only way you reach back and pick up people is to have a business sector that has the right incentives to employ.

We have just had an industrial relations act passed by this parliament, with the support of the Australian Democrats and the Western Australian Greens and in the teeth of the opposition of both the Liberal and National parties, which actually makes it less attractive for small business to take on new staff.

There is no area of industrial behaviour so etched in the Australian consciousness and so associated in the Australian consciousness with abuse of privilege, union inspired rorts, bullying tactics and privileges being claimed and conceded by governments over the years as the Australian waterfront.

         It is worth for a moment putting into perspective the claims made by the government that somehow or other it has wrought wondrous miracles over the last 11 years in improving the performance of the Australian waterfront. We keep being told by the government and by the Prime Minister that the last 11 years has been an unending, uninterrupted parade of economic triumph and economic success. We are told about the marvellous structural changes that have occurred. Unblushingly the claim is made that the Australian economy is now the fastest growing in the industrialised world.

         The minister who spoke a few moments ago told us that the retention levels in Australian schools were much lower in 1983 than they are now, and he claimed that that was somehow the result of a deliberate government policy. The reason the retention levels were much lower in 1983 than they are now is that 11 years ago most young people thought they could get a job when they left school. They did not have embedded in their consciousness the belief that they had to remain at school because there was fundamentally no alternative. Of course there was high youth unemployment in 1983, but it had not been a decade-long phenomenon. Therefore, at that particular time, the expectations of young Australians were nowhere near as pessimistic. For the government to seriously and unblushingly say that the high retention rate is the result of an inspired, deliberate policy construct of its 11 years in office is absolutely ridiculous.

In recent times, Australian waterfront costs have declined. Of course they have declined. It is the relative performance in that area that is important to our economic achievement. Over the last few years Australia's waterfront costs have declined by between five and 10 per cent. Over that same period, New Zealand's costs—remember New Zealand; the government always likes to knock New Zealand when it suits—have declined by 45 per cent, and that is from a base that was already lower than Australia's. Sydney's stevedoring costs are now up to five times higher than New Zealand's.

The reality is that this international competitiveness is a never ending race and unless we keep in front, we lose. There is no finish line.

Unless our amendments are successful, we intend to vote against this bill because, despite what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has said, it does endorse the maintenance of a register of waterfront employees. Stripped of all the verbiage, the maintenance of a register of waterfront employees is a reaching back to the dark ages of Australia's waterfront.

This government has put us in hock to the bankers of the world.

         The Prime Minister talks every day about the need for us to move into the Asia-Pacific region. He is right. We have been doing that since 1957 when John McEwen, the Deputy Prime Minister in a coalition government, trailblazed into Asia by signing the Japan-Australia free trade agreement. I say in passing that it would have taken more political courage to sign a Japan-Australia free trade agreement in 1957 than it would in 1994 to talk about the importance of Australia's association with Asia.

         We are unhappy with this bill. We will vote against it unless it is amended. It fails to address the fundamental challenge of any intelligent system of workplace relations in this country, and that is productivity. What will this bill do to increase the productivity of the Australian waterfront? The answer is nothing. Will this bill potentially make that productivity less? The answer is yes. Will this legislation do anything to make our industrial relations system more flexible? The answer is no. Will this legislation placate the union organ grinders so far as this government is concerned? The answer is yes. This country is very different from what it was 20 or 30 years ago. Many of the changes that have occurred over that time have been good, but a lot of them have been bad.

The waterfront remains a glaring example of just how out of date this country remains according to international best practice. We may be doing better now than we were doing 20 years ago, but in relative terms we are still a long way behind the rest of the world. If we are to have that super-duper international best practice that the Prime Minister tells us time and time again is so absolutely essential then we should not be passing legislation like this. We should never have passed the Industrial Relations Act.

This bill and the Industrial Relations Act represent, yet again, a very simple fact: for the last 11 years the industrial relations laws of this country have been drafted by people who have no understanding of how the average small business in Australia operates. They have no idea that the average small businessman is simultaneously the managing director, the sales manager, the personnel manager, the chief accountant and the tea lady all rolled into one. They have this vision that small business operators have a personnel department that can fill out all the forms, answer all the questionnaires and keep all the records of discussions with employees. They do not know the realities of trying to run a small business and the sorts of pressures that bear upon small businessmen. Until they do, they will never solve the unemployment problem of this country. The solution to that problem lies with a resurgent small business sector.

         In the field of waterfront reform, which this legislation is principally concerned with, I think it is fair to say that this government has shown a great deal of courage in its policy moves, despite the occasional outburst to the contrary by those opposite. The process of reform on the waterfront is continuing at a steady pace thanks to the government's commitment to deal with this area in a thoroughly comprehensive and far-sighted manner.

         The purpose of this bill is to repeal redundant provisions dealing with waterfront disputes and the general levy payable by waterfront employers. The bill will also reduce the size of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee and provide for that body to cease to exist when its functions are completed. The majority of the amendments reflect changes in the nature of employment on the waterfront.

         As most honourable members are no doubt aware, unfortunately it is true that the Australian waterfront has had an unhappy history of inefficient operations compared to the world's best ports. Reform of the waterfront has been proceeding since the Weber task force on shore-based shipping reported in 1986 and found that one of the main causes of inefficiency was low labour and equipment productivity rates. The task force was followed by a comprehensive Inter-State Commission report, which was released in 1989. The ISC recommended a three-year reform package to increase productivity, which centred on changes to the way in which people were employed in the stevedoring industry, reductions in the work force and improvements in management.

         Following the signing of an in principle agreement between employers, waterside unions and the ACTU in September 1989, a three-year program was introduced to reform the industry. Prior to the introduction of the reform program, stevedoring had a lot of problems in the industrial area. Employment was industry based. Employers drew on a pool of workers who enjoyed virtually a lifetime guarantee of employment. As a result, there was no direct link between employers and employees, and conditions of employment were standardised across the industry. These arrangements arose out of the history of the waterfront and the unions' successful fight to move away from the pool of casual labour employment arrangements that had characterised the industry for many years.

         The manner of employment changed during the reform program so that stevedoring companies directly employed their work force with the changed aim to increase competition among the stevedoring firms and create a greater affinity between the employer and the employee. As employers could now offer different conditions of employment, there was greater incentive for employers and employees to negotiate changes that could improve productivity and offer rewards to both the company and its employees. The change was implemented through 108 enterprise agreements established by this government.

         Another central plank of the reform program was the reduction in the size of the stevedoring work force through the provision of attractive retirement-redundancy packages. In the period between the introduction of the reform package on 1 November 1989 and its end on 31 October 1992, the work force was reduced by 4,479 people who took retirement-redundancy packages and 840 by natural attrition. An additional 265 people were recruited into the industry. The net reduction of 5,054 left a work force of 3,818 and represented a reduction in the work force of 57 per cent—and this is quite substantial—which was over twice the reduction anticipated in the 1989 in principle agreement. The retirement-redundancy packages cost a total of $413 million, of which the Commonwealth contributed $165 million, the balance being met by levies on employers and their customers.

         The reform program resulted in considerable change in the stevedoring industry. I will now list some claims of performance improvement. The number of containers handled per person per shift has increased by 130 per cent. Annual savings from the process are estimated to be $300 million. Stevedoring charges have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent between 1990-91 and 1992. The time needed to load and unload a ship with an average container load has fallen from 44 hours in 1989 to 27 hours in June 1992. For grain terminals, costs have fallen by approximately 50 per cent. Ship turnaround time has been reduced by approximately 45 per cent. The number of containers handled per crane hour has increased by 57 per cent. So there have been substantial changes on the waterfront, despite what some people may suggest.

         An international comparison of waterfront productivity was conducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics, which released its report in March 1993. The BIE made a number of provisos concerning the comparisons. It noted the difficulties in obtaining identical data from a number of ports and the difference that economies of scale can produce. For example, productivity indicators are measured in terms of a TEU, the equivalent of a standard 20-foot container, which is the type most often used in Australian trade. However, a number of the larger world ports, such as Singapore, deal with a large percentage of 40-foot containers, which are rated as two TEUs. It does not take twice the time to deal with a 40-foot container that it takes for a 20-foot container. The BIE also noted that stevedoring charges are not the sole cost of a port and that port authority charges in Australia are significantly higher than the overseas average.

         The BIE found that average labour productivity in Australian coal terminals is more than 50 per cent higher than the overseas average. Although there was difficulty in gaining valid data for a comparison of labour productivity in relation to container traffic, the available information showed Australian ports to be significantly below the best. The BIE also found that the average crane rate for Australian container terminals was 20.1 TEUs per hour compared with 25 for Singapore and 29 for Yokohama, that labour productivity and equipment utilisation in Australian coal terminals is approaching, or is at, world best practice, and that productivity in container terminals is in some cases approaching world best practice in similar sized overseas ports, but there is considerable scope for further improvement in many Australian container ports.

         There is some evidence to suggest that the very good rate of reform of the waterfront over the last few years has slowed somewhat recently. A Prices Surveillance Authority report found recently that the reduction in charges to users of the waterfront seems to have levelled off. The report also said that any further gains in waterfront productivity were not likely to match the previous rapid gains. The PSA is also reported as saying that charges may increase as stevedoring companies seek to restore their profits.

         Another concern that I am sure all members of this House can remember was the recent dispute involving Australian Stevedores and stevedoring unions concerning the plan to retrench 55 more employees. This dispute came about when a merger between various stevedoring companies formed Australian Stevedores last year. One result of that merger was that 317 positions for employees were declared surplus, and the company sought voluntary redundancies to achieve the reduction in the work force. Enterprise agreements were reached between the employer and the employees in eight ports, but agreement was not reached in Sydney, where there was disagreement on four  points.

         In February 1994 Australian Stevedores announced that it had not announced sufficient voluntary redundancies and that 55 employees would be retrenched. The union's response was a national stoppage of stevedoring workers. This dispute was temporarily resolved when the Industrial Relations Commission ordered the parties to negotiate and the 55 employees to be reinstated. Negotiations to finally settle the matter are continuing, and the company has announced that an additional 37 employees will be dismissed.

Clause 9 of this amendment bill seeks to amend section 5 of this act to reduce the membership of the committee from seven to four and to ensure the continuation of the tenure of the current chairperson of the committee.

I suggest that a lot of living conditions in the US are nowhere near ours in Australia. We have an obligation to the Australian people.

I was very interested to hear the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who spoke about some of the great changes that have taken place on the Australian waterfront. I was pleased to hear him talk about the improvements and I was pleased to hear him make comparisons with some of the other trading ports around the world. I was also pleased to hear him say that there is room for to us make further improvements here in Australia through our ports.

Unfortunately, the very bill that the honourable member for Oxley is supporting here today, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, goes precisely in the opposite direction of achieving further improvements in productivity through our Australian waterfront. This bill will take Australia back to the period before waterfront reform started in 1989.

         —It is not rubbish. The honourable member for Throsby should be ashamed of himself. Anybody who has an intimate view of what has gone on in the waterfront over the last few years will know that one of the principles of waterfront reform is to establish enterprise employment through enterprise agreements. What does this legislation, which the government hopes will be passed today, do? It goes to the very heart of eroding the benefits of enterprise agreements, enterprise employment. How does it do that? It does it through the establishment of a register of employees of stevedores. That is putting us back in the position we were in prior to 1989 when everybody in the waterfront was employed through a pool—not through individual enterprises—and the union had full control over all of those people who worked on the waterfront.

         I went down to the waterfront during that period and I have been again since. If I had asked a wharfie, `Who do you work for, brother?' he would have said, `The Waterside Workers Federation, of course.' He would not have said that he worked for Conaust, National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, Strang Patrick, as it was then, or whatever other stevedores existed in those days that no longer exist today. But if I went to the waterfront today and asked a wharfie, `Whom do you work for?' he would say, `Conaust' or `Australian Stevedores'. They are the only two left, due to all the government's reforms.

         —Perhaps somebody in the advisers box could remember every word of it. This legislation will take us back to the situation of port pools and the establishment of a register. This is typical of what has happened on the waterfront for a long time throughout Australia's history. We have seen the Australian people pay out $430 million over the period of the waterfront reform process to entice wharfies to retire ahead of schedule through redundancy payments.

         There were 4,500 wharfies who retired. On average $100,000 was given to every retiring wharfie over and above their superannuation, their sick leave and long service leave payments, et cetera. Every cent of that $430 million is being paid for by Australians, either through their taxes or through higher charges on the goods that they consume through the establishment of this levy which will pay for the remaining amounts over and above the taxpayer's contribution.

         That amount of money was paid to get the unions to agree to change. As part of the process, those who did not take the redundancy package and kept their jobs as wharfies received average wage increases of 23 per cent. According to the rhetoric of some in this place, the average wharfie is a hard bitten, hard done by soul. But the average wharfie is earning several times more than the average Australian for working probably only 60 per cent as hard as the average Australian.

We are masking the reason why we need a register by saying, `We must have this register because we have to conform with ILO convention 137'—I think that is right. Who is the ILO?

         The whole purpose of what we have achieved on the waterfront is to try to make Australia's waterfront more internationally competitive. I heard the honourable member for Oxley and I no doubt will hear from the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) about how we have gone so far towards achieving this. Even though we have spent all this money, $430 million, and provided wharfies with a 23 per cent pay rise, and treated them like royalty, productivity levels on the Australian waterfront have declined over recent time. During the waterfront reform process, there is no doubt that crane loading rates improved by up to 50 per cent—no doubt about that at all. But it is interesting to note that in the latter portion of last year crane loading rates for TEUs per hour at Sydney went from 19.95 down to 13.8. The same thing occurred in Melbourne where they went from 26.75 TEUs per hour down to 18.8 TEUs per hour. What we see there is effectively a reduction in crane loading rates at two of our major ports, Sydney and Melbourne, of around 50 per cent. What does that mean? The wharfies got the $430 million and the 23 per cent increase in pay rates, and the productivity gains that were achieved in the process of forking out all of that have now been eroded. As a result, Australia really has not got that far down the track towards being internationally competitive.

         It is interesting to note some TEU rates or crane loading rates for containers in other countries. If we look at Felixstowe for the same period as I just compared Sydney and Melbourne to, it had crane loading rates of 35.36 TEUs per hour. Auckland, New Zealand, had TEU crane loading rates of 30 per hour, compared with Sydney which had 13.8 and Melbourne which had 18.8. So we have not achieved one of the goals set through waterfront reform of making ourselves internationally competitive. It is fair enough to say that loading a container in Sydney is 2 1/2 times more expensive than loading exactly the same container in New Zealand. That is the sort of competition we are up against and that is the sort of failure that we have had despite the fact that we have forked out all of that money, provided the wharfies that remain with a substantial increase in their pay rates and given them, I think, a pretty fair deal.

         The government, by masquerading it as a requirement to meet ILO convention 137, is doing this country a great disservice because there is no doubt at all that the net result of this will be, as the legislation says, the re-establishment of a register of waterside employees. What do we need a register for? We have enterprise employment now. We need the register so that the union knows who is on the waterfront, whom they are working for, for how much, for how long and all those sorts of things. It is a process of re-establishing what was there before 1989.

         If the stevedore employers are doing what they are required to do by law, then they already keep a list of their own employees, which is privy to them but which can be provided to people from the industrial relations department, the tax man or whoever else requires it. So we do not need an additional list set up through this legislation. Indeed, why do we need the list? The list is simply there for the benefit of the Maritime Union of Australia. It wants to reintroduce a list because it wants to re-establish the job for life syndrome on the waterfront. That has been a fact of life on the waterfront for quite a long time now, but the threat has been that through the waterfront reform process that was going to be traded off. We saw in February of this year Australian stevedores go through a very costly and painful strike.

         At first blush it probably is. But when we go to the structure of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee that the minister is proposing it is quite possible that the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee will be completely dominated by wharfies, members of the Maritime Union of Australia. From memory, the chairman of it is appointed by the minister and there are two other people on it—an appointee of the Maritime Union of Australia and an employer of stevedores. People will say that is all right, that means there is one from the unions and one from the employers. But that does not necessarily follow. If, for example, a representative of the Federated Stevedores in Darwin happens to be appointed to the committee we end up with a member of the trade union, the Maritime Union of Australia, because Federated Stevedores is indeed a stevedoring business which is owned by the local branch of what was the Waterside Workers Federation in Darwin. So it is quite possible if we go down that route to end up with a committee fully dominated by members of the Maritime Union of Australia, the wharfies.

         By making this compromise through this amendment that the minister has indicated that he will put forward, we could still end up, and indeed I would suggest we will most likely end up, with the reintroduction of a register. If we have the reintroduction of a register, it will take away all of the benefits that we have achieved on the Australian waterfront. It causes me a great deal of alarm and distress to see this legislation being put forward. I know it causes stevedore employers around Australia the same sort of distress. They are totally opposed, to a man, to this legislation because from their point of view there is no need for it; and from their point of view it leads to the reintroduction of the old habits and the old ways that this country fought so long against and paid a very high price to get rid of.

We do not like it because we think, as do those who have been involved with the waterfront for quite some time now, that there is no purpose in the future for the existence of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. The whole process of waterfront reform was going to end with the axing of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee because there was going to be no need for its existence. The sole purpose of the existence of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is to collect a levy to pay for the redundancies that have been forked out to retiring wharfies over the last few years. Once those redundancies have been paid for, there is no further purpose for the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee; therefore, its future is limited.

If we are to start throwing blame around about what is happening on the waterfront, we should take a look at a few of the actors, the people, on the waterfront. The members of that committee spent over a year going around the various waterfronts in Australia.

Take the tardy attitude of many people towards the use of electronic transfers. Take the whole stream, the whole host, of documentation: thousands and thousands of documents. Surely those opposite are not blaming the waterside workers for all these things. If we start to hurl blame around, let us hurl it perhaps a little wider and at where it should be most directed.

         The honourable member for Hume made much of the dispute which occurred on the waterfront earlier this year when 55 workers were sacked. It was very interesting that he did not bother explaining how that was brought about by a try-on by the bosses which they have done before. He did not bother quoting the judgment which was handed down by Deputy President Williams. That judgment, in part, states:

         I suggest that no player in the industry has been more prepared to take on the challenge of restructuring and reform than have the unions on the waterfront in Australia, yet the only thing we ever hear from those opposite when dealing with the waterfront is totally negative. It is as if nothing had been achieved. There have been achievements, there have been reforms and there has been great restructuring. In many cases it has been the waterfront unions that have led the way with reform and restructuring in Australia. Interestingly, not only on the waterfront but also in the other section of the Maritime Union, the former Seamen's Union, there has been tremendous change and restructuring there.

It is one of the most dangerous occupations in Australia. When I was being told how wonderful it was, I asked, `What about safety? It would seem to me that loading logs is a very dangerous job.' I was told, `You have to understand, Colin, that having only one worker here is even safer because we have stopped the possibility of having accidents. The more workers you have on the site, the more likely you are to have accidents. If people went down the hole and went to sleep we might drop the logs on them, so that is why we have only one person with a front-end loader going around picking up these logs.' I would suggest that they have got quite a serious accident risk there. If people want to work to the conditions that exist in New Zealand today they are quite welcome to, but I do not particularly want to work with the industrial conditions New Zealand has, nor do the people that I represent.

         The recently completed reform process had its origins in the Webber task force on shore based shipping, which handed down its report of 1986. This task force was, as many honourable members would be aware, followed by a comprehensive Interstate Commission report which was released in 1988. The Interstate Commission report recommended a three-year reform package to increase productivity focusing on changes in the way people were employed in the stevedoring industry, reductions in the work force and improvements in management, a significant area in the overall operation of the waterfront and an area that the opposition chooses to ignore. This followed the signing of an in-principle agreement by employees, waterside unions and the ACTU in September 1989 and a three-year program was introduced to reform and restructure this industry.

         Before the reform program began, stevedoring employment was industry based. Employers drew from a pool of workers. The result was no direct link between the employer and the employee and the conditions of employment were standardised across the industry. Before the opposition starts making its usual rumblings, I point out that this arrangement reflected the history of the waterfront, an arrangement supported by coalition governments of many years standing. I listened to what the honourable member for Hume was saying and say that the opposition has supported the employment practices on the waterfront over many years.

         The manner of employment changed under the reform program so that stevedoring companies directly employed their work force. The change had a goal of competition amongst stevedoring firms and a stronger link between the parties in the employment relationship. Stevedoring employers could now offer different conditions of employment and the incentive to negotiate changes which could improve productivity and offer both the companies and workers rewards. The change was implemented through 108 enterprise agreements. The agreements were approved and watched over by WIRA.

         The reform process reduced the size of the waterfront work force. This was achieved by retirement and redundancy packages. I know that the amount that was paid galls honourable members opposite; nevertheless, these were negotiated between November 1989 and October 1992. The waterfront work force was reduced by over 4,000 people who took advantage of the retirement and redundancy packages but, because of the age process, there was also a recruitment to the waterfront.

         As has been said, this legislation will reflect changes in the nature of employment on the waterfront. I am disappointed that the opposition has decided to oppose the legislation, but I am not surprised. As I said, sooner or later members of the opposition are going to realise that there are more than waterside workers on the waterfront; there is a whole range of players in that very important sector of the Australian industry; so they should stop bashing the waterside workers and have a look at some of the people they purport to support. If there are inefficiencies on the waterfront, for once they should do a bit of homework and trace the blame to where those inefficiencies really lie. They will find that, in most cases, it is not the waterside workers of Australia whose union has been massively reformed and restructured; it is many of those people that they stand up in this parliament and purport to support. I reject the opposition's amendment and support this legislation.

I am not, despite the words of the honourable member for Throsby, going to deal at length with the old inefficiencies and enmities that have existed on the waterfront not only in this country but in other countries around the world for almost 100 years. That history is colourful and it is interesting. But I am not sure how relevant it is to the debate today except that this bill gives the government, and gives the industry itself, the opportunity to go back to the employment practices of the past, which were inappropriate, which were inefficient, which were costly and which placed a burden on all Australians in terms of the cost that they had to pay for imported goods.

         The reform process, which other speakers have referred to, has been a long, slow process.

         The fact is that we have achieved some efficiencies in the waterfront with the so-called reform process. The fact is that there are fewer people now employed on the waterfront. The fact is that there are now two major companies in the five major ports which compete directly with each other. The fact is that we now have supposed enterprise agreements between the union and the employers. Those enterprise agreements designate the working conditions of the people who work in the industry at the ports and designate their pay rates and the totality of their terms and conditions of employment.

         But those employees today are employed directly by companies. Before this process began, before the restructuring, we had for a very long time pooled employment. In fact, it was back in 1967 that we introduced permanent employment for registered waterside workers. Prior to 1967 all waterfront employment had been on a casual basis. Individuals were selected from a pool and put into their jobs on a particular day by the employers, but the pool itself was maintained and directed by the union. So if a person wanted a job on the waterfront then that person went not to an employer seeking to ask the employer to give him a job; he went to the union. He went to the union boss and did what was necessary to get the union boss to give him a job. That job meant that the person had the right to be registered and the right to stay in the casual pool, which meant that maybe he got work and maybe he did not.

         The port pools were also at that time established for excess workers. They were for those who could not be used on the day, and those individuals either sat and waited for eventual employment or were told to go home and were still paid. The payment for that came via an industry levy which was administered by a separate organisation. In 1977 that organisation was abolished in five major ports and pool employees were allocated to employers. New levies were established at that time in order to pay for the pool employees whose labour could not be utilised on the day or on the shift.

         It was in fact a jobs for life industry. If one wanted a job on the waterfront, one approached the union and one could be guaranteed employment forever. That was not unusual around the world, nor is it necessarily unusual in other industries in other countries. It had not been generally the practice in Australia that we had jobs for life, as it was not in the country which I came from many years ago, but there are countries in Europe where jobs for life have been part of the industrial scene for a very long time. Again, it is not part of the Australian experience. One of the problems with jobs for life is the fact that there is no real incentive to do better and to progress, to work harder or faster, because, no matter what one does or does not do today, one still is paid and one still has the job tomorrow. A job where performance is taken into account and one is paid appropriately tends to generate greater efficiencies for any organisation and for an economy than does a jobs for life type of scenario.

         Following 1977, when the new levies were established and the pool employees were allocated to employers, we maintained that scenario until the most recent reform process. Now we have employees employed by the employers and no pool, because in effect the $420 million has been used to pay employees who have left the industry for their redundancy and has been used to help recompense others for disadvantage which they have suffered through the reform process.

         This bill, firstly, recognises the role of enterprise agreements by repeal of division 9 of part 6 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, which established port conciliators and coordinating committees. This bill finally recognises what has become fact, and that is enterprise agreements. We all know that enterprise agreements were not on the agenda of the Labor Party, were not part of any ALP platform. Enterprise agreements are finally seeing the light of day in our country because of the continued pressure put on government by my side of politics, by the opposition, to try to free up the labour market and to try to make more meaningful the employment contract between an employee and his employer rather than between some obscure body and the employer or, in the case of the waterfront, a pool of employees who owed their pool existence to the union bosses themselves. That part of the bill which recognises enterprise agreements is a positive part of the bill.

         However, the bill then goes on and amends section 5, to reduce the size of the finance committee and to remove the general levy, but to allow special levies to be struck by the committee and to reintroduce an industry register of employees. It is these two issues with which the opposition takes exception today. The committee itself should have the right to determine its own members and the committee should certainly represent the interests and rights of the employers, who are those who provide the employment on the waterfront, as in fact they do in any other enterprise or any other industry. So we object to this reduction in the size of the committee and the inability of the industry to establish its members of that committee.

         Any attempt to return to the pooling arrangements will break down the enterprise employment agreements which are in place and will break down the whole shift in emphasis that the government tells us it is so determined to push ahead with, and that is to re-establish relationships between those who do the work and those who pay for the work. Those relationships will become very important, both in a productivity sense and in a personal sense, so that those in work are able to feel that they contribute to a company's wellbeing—and to their own employment, if you will—by helping to make a company strong and competitive and by helping it to produce the products and services that that company was formed to produce and supply.

         So the concept of jobs for life, which is inherent in pooling, must not return to the Australian waterfront; but this bill allows it to return. And the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) tells us he must do this because he is required to by International Labour Organisation convention No. 137, which Australia ratified in 1974. The date 1974 is particularly important, because I note that the requirement for all countries under conventions of the United Nations is that these ILO conventions may be dispensed with only once every 10 years, on the anniversary of signing and ratifying the particular convention.

That resulted in the lists and that resulted in all of those practices we have heard about in this place time and time again which acted to the detriment of the Australian economy and were rorts—well and truly some of the greatest rorts that have ever been perpetrated on Australian business and Australian commerce.

         When the waterfront reform process took place, we transferred any obligation towards those pooled employees, firstly, by redundancy payments which were exceedingly overgenerous and which were accepted voluntarily by those in the jobs. They were not imposed; they were put there voluntarily. As for the removal of some of the other rorts and practices, compensation of the remaining employees took place by way of very generous increases in hourly rates and further improvements in conditions of employment.

         We have long since taken care of any responsibility we had under ILO convention 137, ratified in 1974, which we should withdraw from in 1994. I make this recommendation to the Minister for Industrial Relations with great joy. The minister would only want to bring back the register to allow the union to re-create a pool so that the committee could reintroduce levies. That would take us back to the old practices, and the benefits that we have obtained in improvements in productivity and performance would be lost.

I have been listening to the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, they have forgotten nothing and they have learnt nothing. What we hear from them are the same old attitudes, the same old catchcries, the same old slogans of attack. All the problems on the waterfront are problems for people who work on the waterfront. In the ideal world, I suppose the honourable member for La Trobe would probably abolish people altogether on the waterfront.

         If there were no people on the waterfront, most of the problems would still remain. The honourable member for La Trobe carried on about ILO convention 137. The legislation provides for the register to be maintained. If the honourable member looks closely at the legislation, he will find that the amendment that will be moved later in this debate does not bear any relationship to the re-establishment of the old financial arrangements or wage arrangements between the work force and employers. As I have said, each time these issues or the waterfront comes up, the same slogans are regurgitated.

          Hansard

        This Bill is part of a parcel of legislation designed to enable the introduction of new administrative, financial and industrial arrangements for the stevedoring industry.

       <para>
        The then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, foreshadowed it. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        That is the opposition's legislation. He was going to reform the waterfront. He went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will be recalled that up until 1967 the nature of waterside employment was almost exclusively casual. This resulted in a situation whereby the absence of employer-employee relationships which existed in most other industries adversely affected the performance of the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The waterfront we had up until the waterfront reform of this government was the creation of the conservative governments—of the Fraser government's Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street. I will not go through all the text. Members can read it. I will just pluck out some bits to drive the point home. On the following page, page 2247, he referred to the problem of surplus labour on the waterfront. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first step was to act in respect of the problem of surplus labour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention this because the previous speakers on the other side made great play of the fact that there have been redundancy payments. Redundancy payments on the waterfront were not the creation of this government or Labor governments. They were the creation of conservative Fraser governments. Mr Street went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Arising from those proceedings, a special redundancy program was developed which was to apply for a limited period . . . This program had the immediate effect of some 900 men being induced to leave their employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the very point that was made by the previous speaker. People voluntarily accepted redundancy packages. According to
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        , the voluntary packages were advanced by the Fraser government. Mr Street continued:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I might point out that since 1975 the work force has been reduced by almost 3,000. The total industry work force has declined since 1966 from 21,000 men to a position where today there are slightly more than 10,000 waterside workers. The cost of removing men from the industry has not been light. There was, however, an acceptance by those in the industry that the level of the labour force had to be reduced and I would point out that this reduction was achieved without disruption of any kind.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has come from those on the other side today shows that they have no knowledge of the origin of the legislation, of the arrangements on the waterfront. Those arrangements were the creation of conservative governments. The Fraser government in 1977 offered the redundancy packages to buy people—surplus work force—out of the waterfront. It is there in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        , as I have mentioned, on page 2247. Instead of coming here today to try to make an effective contribution to this debate, as one would expect from them, those opposite have again launched an assault on the people who work on the waterfront.

         Similarly, we have the performance from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). The honourable member for Hume has a habit of making a statement—how inaccurate it is does not seem to matter to him—then, having made that statement, repeating it whenever the opportunity comes. The statement he made this morning about the fall-off in crane handling rates in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne I can read to you also from
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

That information appears to have been drawn from an article in the

The first question is: who was the Mr X? If it was not Senator Richardson, please tell us who it was. Who was the Mr X, the senior ALP figure? The second question to be answered is: who were the underworld figures in Sydney and on the Gold Coast who were paying for these prostitutes? Who were those people? The third question to be answered is: what compensation was there? What was the quid pro quo? What services were rendered by this senior ALP official to warrant this sort of looking after that was taking place for him?

        If this investigation was being conducted with the knowledge of these two bodies, it is absolutely incomprehensible to me, as a minister who has served for six years, that the relevant minister would not have known these facts. How would an investigation of a senior ALP figure in Australia not have been brought to the attention of the relevant minister? I think that the minister is now in a very serious situation. To say that he did not know that is an admission of total towering incompetence and of being treated in total contempt by the officers in his department—or he knew and was using some tricky nuances and legal devices to slip the noose on saying anything yesterday in this House. That is the substance of the fourth question.

It is like an adjournment debate: we do not interrupt each other's speaking time by taking what I and many others might regard as frivolous points of order. What will happen, if we are going to have that all through the grievance debate today, is—as someone suggested—that most members will not have very much time to air their grievances, and that, I suggest, would be a great pity.

The fact is, Mr Deputy Speaker, for a member to say that what someone did was aberrant is certainly not within the ambit of a reflection that a member could legitimately ask to be withdrawn. If we are going to have the standing order drawn that tightly, no-one will be able to say anything whatsoever, and poor old members of the opposition will be sat down all through question time with their questions and interjections. So I would put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the word `aberrant' is certainly not unparliamentary.

He has the material, he told the House, about this behaviour. Why be a coward in this place and use newspaper reports to allege certain facts to happen, if one has evidence? Why would one behave in this fashion? The lemon from Kennedy—and the National Party has dropped a lemon in this place; of that there is no doubt, because we now know that his contribution to policy in this House will be zilch—has exposed himself as a member who will have no comments to make on economic matters, on foreign affairs, on any serious issue affecting this parliament. He has now disgraced himself as a member of no value to the Australian community. He has disgraced himself, the memory of his father and all of us in this place by his behaviour and his comments today. If he has got material which can justify any of the claims he has made in this House, let him use it. But he has not got any material. He has not got anything to back it up. He is in cowards' castle acting like a coward, and he should be ashamed of himself. He is a person who served Bjelke-Petersen in the most corrupt government this country has ever seen, and he stands in this House and talks about corruption. Well, so may it be, Mr Deputy Speaker.

         , there was a survey on multicultural affairs that showed that only three in 10 voters thought the government could be trusted and only one in five considered that it knew what it is doing. People were asked to comment on whether they think leaders and other politicians are untrustworthy or insincere. The survey says something about Australians' approach to politics and to the political world.

         In other words, today I wish to place on record my very strong support for the principle of citizens initiated referenda. It is a principle of having a process where the public can initiate and then make or repeal a law by referenda. No-one of any political view could deny that such an approach would be democratic. There is a need to cut the disillusionment the public has with the current system.

         Public opinion, of course, is understandably disillusioned with government and politicians. All of us looked at the policies announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prior to the last election and at what he promised. However, he tricked the Australian people because no sooner had the election taken place than the government marched into this place to announce that it was unable to fulfil its election promises.

         We have had a situation in the ACT where the Liberal opposition has put forward a policy for CIR—or DD, direct democracy, as it is also known. I understand that it is very likely that the Legislative Assembly in the ACT, with the support of the Independents, could well carry this proposal, and it could be that the ACT becomes the laboratory in Australia for citizens initiated referenda. As such, this would be a catalyst for the introduction of this initiative elsewhere.

         Now is the time that we in the federal parliament should consider following the example likely to be enacted shortly in the ACT assembly. It ought to be noted that the CIR is not the property of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the ALP, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, until the 1960s had CIR as part of its platform. The Australian Democrats have supported it; the National Party government in Queensland prior to the election in 1989 looked at it. The Liberal Party in Queensland went to the people at the last state election supporting the principle of citizens initiated referenda.

         At federal level the coalition has been investigating this concept for a number of years, and honourable members would be aware of the green paper released by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in 1988 when he was then shadow Attorney-General. The coalition has not as yet adopted the principle of CIR but I certainly hope that it is going to be on our agenda.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course, one ought to look at some of the principles contained in the paper by the honourable member for Flinders. It is important that a very substantial proportion of the electorate indicates that it supports the initiative to be put to the people. About five per cent of the Australian electorate would be an appropriate percentage and I understand that would amount to approximately 500,000 signatures. If we use the precedent of the American situation, this should indicate that frivolous proposals are not put up. Frivolous proposals would waste the time of the community and indeed cost great amounts of money.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is also important to realise that referenda ought to be held only on the days of state, federal or local elections. The last thing we would want would be for referenda to be held regularly every three months. The cost would be horrendous and, indeed, we could well have a situation where the system, which I believe is very worthwhile, could be brought into disrepute.

         In looking at the federal situation, it would be wise to ensure that not only was there the necessary majority of electors in the Commonwealth to carry the initiative but also that there was a majority of people in the majority of states. Of course, that goes very much to accountability. It would also go very much to recognition of the fact that any referendum carried by the Australian people should have a broad consensus right across the Australian nation.

         Opponents of CIR have pointed to a number of potential drawbacks. Some people say that there is a difficulty in identifying and verifying signatures: 500,000 signatures represent a lot of people. That could be approached through a sampling process and I think that it would be very unlikely that any group would look at bringing 500,000 signatures forward, if those signatures had been forged or rorted. A verifying process by sampling could ensure that the signatures were indeed genuine.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The cost is another matter which is regularly raised by those who fear the wrath of the people. As I said, if we ensure that the referenda are held only at the time that elections are held, we would certainly get around the problem. Those people who hold others in monumental contempt would suggest that the general public does not have any ability to draft laws. Looking at some of the shocking bills and amendments that the government has brought in, and remembering the discussions we have had over and over again on certain bills, I would have to say that the public certainly would not have a monopoly on bad drafting. Facilities could be made available to people to ensure that bills were of a very high standard.

         Of course, there are solutions for all of the problems raised by opponents of direct democracy. We do have a good system currently. We have a constitution that has worked and that has ensured that, as a nation, we enjoy freedoms that are the envy of the world. I include the constitutional monarchy as being one of those institutions that really have helped us as Australians to be envied by people throughout the world. But we could make our system better and I would therefore look at CIR as being a supplement to a system that works well. It is working in 26 states in the United States. It has existed in Switzerland since 1874 and it exists today in various forms in several European countries and I understand that, in Canada, it is widely used at local government level.

         It is very important that, as elected representatives of the people, we do whatever we can to restore the regard that people have for the political process.

         We also find that there has been a suggestion that the government is going to seek to overrule the laws in Tasmania in relation to homosexuality. If CIR existed in Tasmania, the way to resolve any problem would be for those people who feel that the Tasmanian parliament does not represent the will of the Tasmanian people to bring forward a referendum that could be dealt with at the time of the next election. The will of the people of Tasmania would determine whether the government of Tasmania is in or out of step with the community.

         We must do whatever we can to gather input from the community. We, of course, do not have a monopoly on wisdom and commonsense. Indeed, many of the bills that have been carried through this place have in fact been quite ridiculous and have helped to bring Australia as a nation and the parliament as an institution into disrepute. I think that there is no valid criticism of citizen initiated referenda or direct democracy which cannot be addressed. What we have to do, as parliamentarians of all parties, is to sit down and try to work out how to take this very important initiative and make this very important improvement to our Australian system work for the benefit of the Australian people—the people we are supposed to represent.

         —Today I would like to recognise a great moment in world history. In particular, I refer to the incredible achievements, against all odds, in recent days of a great man. Of course, I refer to Nelson Mandela, the president-elect of the Republic of South Africa. Nelson Mandela will be elected president of South Africa; it is only a matter of time before that is declared. It is worth considering the events that have taken place over the last few days and the events leading up to that great moment in world history.

         In 1910 the black people of South Africa were excluded from their country's parliamentary process, so for 84 years we have had an abhorrent, repressive system of apartheid—racial discrimination—whereby all except an exclusive white minority were denied basic human rights, including the right to vote, of all things.

         It is significant also to point out the contribution made by the party which I am very proud to be a member of, the Australian Labor Party, in the process that we have seen in South Africa. Last year the national executive of the Labor Party decided that the party would assist the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela's party, in its election campaign. That was a very good decision, I believe, especially given the fact that the majority of South Africans would never have voted before or ever had any experience of elections. Certainly the ANC had never been allowed to take part in an election before. So I think it was very important for like-minded political parties and political movements like the Australian Labor Party to assist in that process.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to read out a letter to the parliament, a letter that I was very proud to receive as a member of the Australian Labor Party. It was a letter dated 24 April 1994. It was sent to every member of the Australian Labor Party. My letter reads:

        I am writing to you as a member of the Australian Labor Party to say thank you for the assistance the Labor Party has provided to the ANC. This week 18 million South Africans will vote for the very first time in an election that is not merely a contest between different political organisations but a contest about freedom. Since its inception the ANC has been committed to the creation of a non-racial democratic South Africa—a South Africa that will protect the rights of the individual while building a nation in which all are equal and secure. It is a commitment I know is shared by the Australian Labor Party. But the ban on the African National Congress was lifted a mere three years ago and, unlike you, we have never fought an election. It has meant we have had to instantly acquire skills that under normal conditions would have taken decades. That is why I want to take this opportunity to express my profound appreciation of the support our struggle has received from the Australian Labor Party and therefore from you—support not just in international forums but support for ANC endorsed activities through your federal government's aid program, and more recently your party's very direct assistance in providing campaign organisers. The campaign expertise that Ian Henderson, the assistant national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, is currently providing our campaign follows a long tradition of support from Labor's parliamentary leadership, support from leaders like Gough Whitlam, Bob Hawke and more recently Prime Minister Paul Keating. It is therefore reassuring to know that in these final days I can continue to rely on the support of the Australian Labor Party, and for this I thank you.

        As I said, I was extremely proud, along with most members of the Australian Labor Party in Australia to receive that letter from Nelson Mandela. It very rightly points out the support that the ALP gave. The ALP is, after all, a like-minded party having the same beliefs in equality and democracy and social justice as the ANC. It is quite right that our party is recognised for its support.

         It is also fair to mention that there are others who have contributed. One should mention the contribution made by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, for his role as an eminent person in the CHOGM process. Of course, at that stage most of the British Commonwealth countries were on board in the fight against apartheid and repression in South Africa, all except one, the British government led by that arch right wing reactionary, Margaret Thatcher. It was still holding out in support of apartheid. But every other country in the Commonwealth knew how abhorrent the apartheid system was.

         I notice my colleagues in the opposition are still trying to argue the point about this. I would have thought they would be past that by now. Nevertheless, one needs to give credit where credit is due. I believe that Malcolm Fraser, along with the other former Labor Prime Ministers I have mentioned, deserves credit for his ongoing role in the fight against apartheid and the fight for freedom, equality and democracy in South Africa. Of course he, along with Bob Hawke, has been over in South Africa recently.

         I suppose my first memory of South Africa was as a country in an atlas I would have had at school where all the British Commonwealth countries were painted pink. At that stage South Africa was a member of the British Commonwealth. It pulled out of the Commonwealth in the early 1960s after being condemned for its apartheid policies.

         My other early memory of South Africa is due to my lifetime interest in cricket, and to a lesser extent rugby. I can remember Australia playing cricket against South Africa and the South African cricketers being a pretty formidable bunch. There were the Pollock brothers and Eddie Barlow and those people. I certainly remember South Africa as a cricketing nation long before I was old enough to understand dreadful things like apartheid and the political repression that went on in that country. That led to our no longer playing cricket against South Africa after 1969-70 and no longer playing rugby against them after 1971, after that dreadful tour by the Springboks in 1971. They are my early memories.

         Let me once again reflect on the achievements of Nelson Mandela. He is a person who has spent almost 50 years leading the struggle, leading the group called the African National Congress which now can be called a political party in the democratic process. He led that fight against overwhelming odds in a situation where the very existence of his organisation was banned. As I said, against overwhelming odds he has continued to lead that struggle and to be in the position today of being elected president, the first ever democratically elected president of the Republic of South Africa.

         Not only that, this is a guy who spent 27 years in gaol. Can you imagine how you would be if you had spent 27 years in gaol. Here is a man who not only survived that and kept his sanity and kept his faculties and continued to struggle, but he has come out of 27 years in prison to continue to lead his party. The culmination of that is his election as President of the Republic of South Africa. It is truly an amazing feat and truly one which must inspire awe amongst anyone who likes to think about it. The struggle that that man has gone through, together with many of his supporters, is monumental. After 27 years in gaol still to have all his faculties, his sanity, and more importantly his resolve strengthened, is an absolutely incredible achievement.

If a whites-only South African team can give us a hiding in the 1960s and give us a run for our money in the recent series, imagine what a South African cricket team chosen from the whole population could do. When it happens, when the first ever fully representative South African cricket team is selected, imagine what it will do to the Australian team.

        Less than two weeks ago Australia paid homage to the men and women who died on foreign shores for the sake of maintaining the Australian way of life. While we remember those who died, it seems that the federal government would rather forget those remaining. Despite the assurances of the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), I grieve today for the veterans that returned.

         Throughout the past 10 years Australia has been addressing the discrepancies which have occurred in the recognition of the returned service personnel. Recently, however, the federal government has turned around and is once again making the veterans suffer during their time of need. The role of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, as its name suggests, is to look after the interests of all veterans. This would suggest that it should be working with the Returned Services League to establish the most effective means of resolving veteran issues and concerns. The RSL is recognised as the main avenue of support for veterans. The league, however, is continually being kept out of important decisions which affect the lives of thousands of Australians.

         It has been brought to my attention that in at least two major issues recently faced by veterans in Western Australia the government has ignored the wishes of veterans. This has left the veterans confused and often scared—scared at how the government is treating those who assumed they would be looked after by the country which they fought for. Firstly, there is the selling of Hollywood hospital. This is one of the many veteran hospitals which was sacrificed in the federal government's rationalisation process. Prior to the calling for tenders in the beginning of 1993, each state government was approached and offered control of the hospitals. The Western Australian government declined this offer. Since then the Hollywood hospital has been privately purchased by Ramsays, and, while part of the condition of the sale was that veterans would still have access to the hospital and its facilities, the men and women who have risked their lives for this country have put up with a changeover which is less than satisfactory.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This has coincided with the introduction of a scheme which invites veterans to use public hospitals as private patients. While many of the veterans would prefer to continue using the hospital which they have attended for many years, they are being `encouraged' to go elsewhere. This includes being informed that the treatment that they require is only available at a hospital other than Hollywood. This treatment has been available in the past at Hollywood hospital. Since part of the conditions of sale was the maintaining of the ability for veterans to use the facilities, surely the new owners of the hospital would have kept the various facilities which are required for service injuries and illnesses. Veterans are now faced with the trauma of new surroundings and staff.

         The federal government, in its wisdom, neglected to ask the people who use the veterans' hospital if they wanted an alternative venue. The disbursement of funds, which increases the bureaucratic jungle faced by the department, would be increasing total expense, not decreasing it, as a rationalisation program should. No longer do the veterans have the sense of stability in the knowledge that the medical staff would be familiar to them and would know the problems of the patients. Those living within close proximity of the hospital have to face changes in the facilities available since the privatisation of the Hollywood Hospital. The radiography and pathology units are no longer under the control of the hospital. Indeed, the pathology unit is now situated at the St John of God Hospital, some six kilometres away.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The staffing levels of these facilities have also decreased significantly. For example, where radiography used to have between 12 and 16 staff members to cater for patients, under the new lease there are only four staff. Outpatients of Hollywood hospital are now not only facing the trauma of having their medical facilities altered greatly, but they are also facing an increase in the financial burden for necessary medication. Prior to the privatisation of the hospital, both inpatients and outpatients were able to use the registered pharmacist to collection prescriptions at a cost of $2.60. Since the change of owner, however, outpatients are required to pay the full cost of prescriptions dispensed from the hospital and then seek reimbursement. The only alternative they have is taking their prescriptions to another pharmacy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Many veterans do not have their own transport and need to rely on family and friends to take them to the hospital. By having to go elsewhere for necessary medication, the burden, which is placed not only on the veterans but now also on their drivers, is increased. The veterans who have previously used the hospital are also facing psychological battles. The new administration of the hospital decided that new medical files would be issued to all patients. It was with horror that many veterans found, on arrival for an appointment with a doctor at the hospital, that their previous records had apparently vanished. This resulted in many of the veterans contacting the Department of Veterans' Affairs to determine where their files had been placed. The issue of the records was made more confusing when it was revealed that the department was not aware of what had happened to these files.

         Most people prefer to have one doctor or centre which they attend. The alteration of hospital procedure is making the veterans relive the receiving of their injuries. This stability is of particular importance to many of the veterans who have been attending the Hollywood Hospital for decades. I can only begin to imagine the trauma which these people must have faced when they were placed under the impression that they would be required to recall their past problems to receive correct medical attention.

         Not only are the veterans undergoing a battle to keep the security which they have found in hospital but they are increasingly having to fight for the right to compensation for injuries and illnesses which they received during their service. The involvement of the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the claiming of compensation has recently increased dramatically. People in the RSL, which assists the veterans in the procedure involved, are currently being retrained in two-day seminars.

         A clear warning for what the federal government plans to install for the Australian veterans was highlighted in a case which was part of the Baume committee investigations. The Bushell case, which was recently resolved in the High Court, determined whether the Department of Veterans' Affairs had the right to overrule the decision of a medical specialist on a disability compensation claim. It had been determined that Bushell had started smoking through stress during the Second World War. The majority of state governments not only have legislation which bans cigarette advertising from sporting events but run comprehensive `quit' campaigns. Cases of businesses being sued for passive smoking are becoming a common event.

         The federal government, however, will not admit that issuing cigarettes in military ration packs during the Second World War and the Vietnam War may have induced soldiers to start smoking and, as a result, they are now dying of lung cancer. A decision by the High Court, with only one dissenting judge, that the Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot override the findings of that qualified medical specialist was still not good enough for the government. In fear that it would have to give yet more money to the brave men and women of Australia, the government sought any legal advice which could override the precedent which had been set.

        In Western Australia, neither the state executive nor the chairman of the state veterans' affairs committee has yet seen the Baume committee report. Is it any wonder that veterans are fearful of the implications that this report has in store for them? In the past, veterans have had the RSL to reassure them in times of need. By keeping this organisation at bay on important recommendations, this security blanket is being taken away. The offer of assistance by the Department of Veterans' Affairs is barely a substitute. Like any other government department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs must abide by the rulings that the federal government brings down. I can only hope that the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs—good fellow that he is—follows what he has stated about not adhering to all the recommendations of the report. Although these veterans have fought long and hard for our country, it seems that their battle continues.

         —Today I want to grieve for the Aboriginal people who are victims of what I see as the Aboriginal industry which, while absorbing an enormous amount of taxpayers' funds, is clearly not benefiting the Aboriginal people. In my own electorate, there are many areas where housing is appalling. The last time I had a look at Jiggalong community, for instance, it needed 42 houses. The number today would probably be closer to 80. We will only ever build a few houses at a time—five houses this year, five next year. When the houses are built, they are overcrowded. They are often catering for 30 people, sometimes more. Because of this overcrowding, the houses deteriorate rapidly. Doors will only open and close so many times, the toilet will only flush so many times before a breakdown does occur. When the breakdown occurs, of course, we blame the victims. We say, `These useless blackfellows: we give them all this infrastructure and they destroy it.' I find that particularly offensive and it is certainly counterproductive.

         There is a way around it and I believe it must be addressed. I am presently looking at a proposal—not a new one; one I put forward 12 years ago at least—to involve Aboriginal people in the construction of their own houses. It is interesting to note that where people are involved in the construction of their houses there is certainly a greater pride taken in them. They are not subject to the same vandalism and more care is generally taken of them. I think this occurs throughout society, in whatever country or whatever ethnic group we happen to be talking about.

         In the present system of house construction, we bring in a house from outside. We say to a contractor, `You must employ Aboriginal people.' He promptly jacks his price up by 20 per cent to accommodate the cost. The training given to these people is minimal. It is simply, `Hold this. Stand there. Do that,' to the end of the program—usually about 16 weeks. Then they throw them back on the scrap heap. If we could change that to a system where we use local material and the cost is transferred from material to labour, we could build a much cheaper house. We could have a much greater degree of actual Aboriginal ownership of the property and we could have a continual process where people would learn real skills.

         In passing, with the interest being taken in Australian heritage matters, there is going to be a big demand for stonemasons in the future. If we follow this program, maybe in 30 years time the only stonemasons available will be Aboriginal people and they will be able to demand a very high price for their labour. In the meantime, we can provide much better housing if we go about it this way. We do not need to build a four-bedroom house for a young couple starting out; a two-bedroom house is adequate. As a new child arrives, the building group comes back and puts on another room. If the design is appropriate to accommodate this, the growth of the house is quite easy and can be done without much disruption. This would enable us to house these people much more quickly than can be done at the moment and in houses in which they have a big stake. But that is not happening.

I am hoping that negotiations with the mining industry will be successful and we can get the mining industry to fund the trainer and the necessary vehicle.

         When one sees the money being poured into Aboriginal affairs, one must speculate as to what is happening. Today we are spending on Aboriginal affairs money that would buy every Aboriginal family in Australia a new house every two years. Clearly, they are not getting it. The money is not doing what it is supposed to do. I have said before in this House that we should be asking ourselves: what is the point of the Aboriginal affairs policy? Is it to improve the lot of Aboriginal people? If that is the case, I do not think it has been a great success. I have Aboriginal communities that 30 years ago used to kill their own meat, bake their own bread and grow their own vegetables. Today that is all bought frozen from capital cities. The consequent cost and effect on their lifestyle and standard of living have been quite dramatic.

It is interesting to note that, in areas where we have been able to get genuine work programs going, alcoholism and absenteeism have abated considerably.

In fact, one of them wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and got a reply from the minister then responsible—the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker)—saying that because of the complexity of the issue and the distances involved the government had decided to consult only with ATSIC, the Kimberley Land Council and the Aboriginal Legal Service. None of these bodies are representative; certainly none of them have the support of the great bulk of Aboriginal people.

         —Mr Cox is calling on the government to handle the land acquisition money through ATSIC. He is not a great supporter of ATSIC, but these Aboriginal people are terrified of land councils. They know the land councils do not represent them, and the Kimberley Land Council is a particular problem. It has very little real support amongst Aboriginal people, although it appears to have the ear of the media and of both major political parties in Western Australia. It is ironic that so often the voices of the people we should be listening to are so totally ignored. The government should heed the advice and demands of Aboriginal people that no new body be set up to handle the land acquisition funds but that they be handled through the existing body, which Aboriginal people think can be made much more accountable than it is today.

         I just want to demonstrate, in the couple of minutes left to me, how the myth of self-management works. It is a process by which we continually blame the victim. We look at the budget for a station property which an Aboriginal community has acquired. Every station property needs a five-year plan. So we fund the first year, probably late in the year, and then we do not deliver the next year's money until much later in the year and the money cannot be acquitted in time. If the money is not acquitted it is rolled over so the same money is there for the third year. So Aboriginal communities then call in white contractors to do the work and we then say, `Look at these lazy so-and-sos, they get the gubba to come and do the work', when the only reason they do that is that they know they cannot acquit the money in time. We see stations which are in desperate need of capital for stock being denied this money.

         It appears to me that there are people who realise that if the Aboriginal people had the stock they would be self-sufficient and would not be dependent; it seems to me that what is wanted continually by the Aboriginal industry is dependence, not self-sufficiency. The town of Roebourne is an example. Roebourne has been through its traumas. The Aboriginal community committee there decided that it would fund a children's wading pool to go with the very large new pool which the state government provided to the town. The committee wanted the wading pool because Aboriginal children are often charged with looking after siblings and they cannot take them into the big pool; young children are not allowed into the pool unless they are accompanied. The ATSIC committee in Roebourne saw this as a very good, socially useful expenditure of money that also would have very strong implications for health and welfare. The decision was thwarted by bureaucrats in Canberra, who said the proposal was outside the guidelines and that the funding should come from state government or local government—the state government has already made a massive contribution there. The population of Roebourne is 98 per cent Aboriginal. The Aboriginal people made a decision, but their self-determination was thwarted by Aboriginal bureaucrats in Canberra whose vested interest is in maintaining forever the massive industry which they have established.

         —The fundamental accountability and electoral processes in Australia are now being challenged at the federal, state and local government level. The most recent example of this erosion of Australia's democracy is the recent ruling by the United Nations Human Rights Committee that certain sections of the Tasmanian criminal code are in breach of international law. This is not an argument about the rights or wrongs of the Tasmanian criminal law, nor a suggestion that the Commonwealth should not have the external affairs powers granted to it by section 51 of the constitution for judicious use in particular circumstances.

         For decades, the use of this power allowed the Commonwealth to make and enforce laws relating to shipping, international trade and various criminal matters having international ramifications. But, during the 1970s, the Whitlam government decided to use the external affairs power to implement international treaties which have had significant domestic effects within Australia but which were otherwise beyond the scope of Commonwealth power.

         This power was tested in the High Court in the Franklin Dam case of 1983 when the High Court narrowly ruled against a Tasmanian government decision to construct a dam on the grounds that a piece of Commonwealth legislation—the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act—was a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's external affairs power. The four judges in the majority claimed that a Commonwealth law giving effect to a treaty was valid whether or not the subject matter of the treaty involved relationships with other countries or persons outside Australia. This decision opened the floodgates to an expansion of Commonwealth powers as evidenced by the following acts: the Racial Discrimination Act 1975; the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983; the Sex Discrimination Act 1984; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986; the Ozone Protection Act 1989; the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992; the Disability Discrimination Act 1992; the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993; and the Native Title Act 1993.

         The main issue is not one of the Tasmanian legislation, although I make the point that the Tasmanian criminal code was voted upon by a democratically elected body accountable to its electors in a way that remains a pipedream for the citizens of some of the countries which make up the membership of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The people of Tasmania have the political power and the legal capacity to remove the current Tasmanian government from office at the next election, unlike the ongoing United Nations Human Rights Committee which is accountable to nobody.

         The human rights committee consists of 18 experts who are nominated for four-year terms. They are not elected. It is not a court of law. It does not follow established legal procedures, and it does not advance reasoned legal opinions for its decisions. The human rights record of some of the countries which are currently members of the committee, and which have recently sat in judgment on the Tasmanian case, is beyond belief. A 1993 report published by Amnesty International on human rights violations that occurred during 1992, whilst the committee was considering the Tasmanian case, provides some interesting background material. The report was littered with such phrases as `mobilisation of troops', `disappearance and torture of suspects', `extra-judicial execution' and `arrest without warrant and detention without trial'.

         Ecuador is represented on the United Nations committee which has taken Tasmania to task. The Amnesty report details the case of Victor Cadena, who was detained by the Ecuadorian police for three days in July 1992. He was suspended from a rope with his arms tied behind his back. He was beaten and given electric shocks. Other persons engaged in peaceful protest in Ecuador in October of the same year were also tortured with electric shocks and threatened with being thrown from helicopters. How do these examples square with the right to privacy guaranteed in the UN covenant which the human rights committee seeks to enforce? Will the Ecuadorian delegate turn his attention to matters closer to home when he has solved the problems of Tasmania for which he is not accountable?

Other detainees were reported to have had molten plastic dripped on their skin. The Senegalese government failed to investigate human rights violations, including cases of detention without trial, despite these very matters being referred to the same UN Human Rights Committee which dealt with the Tasmanian issue.

         The greatest shame of all is that the Commonwealth government is such a willing accomplice in allowing democratically elected state governments to be judged by these tribunals, who do not even allow the state government to appear before them. Australian states are not even recognised under international law and cannot put a case before the committee, which to many Australians is a denial of natural justice to the electors who vote a state government in or out of office.

         The Basel Convention on the Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal came into force two years ago. Leaving aside questions as to what constitutes waste and the part played by the Greenpeace organisation in promoting the convention within the United Nations, the convention ultimately rests upon the proposition that international solutions alone can solve local waste disposal problems and that they must always override the decisions of otherwise sovereign states. Such a treaty would seem desirable enough on the surface but the convention, about which there has been no domestic political debate, has had the effect of taking the control of the transport of waste materials out of the hands of national governments.

         Our willing acceptance of international supervision of what constitutes waste and how it should be dealt with provides another example of how Australia can have views imposed upon itself by non-accountable bodies. In the final analysis, wastes have to be disposed of by local, state and federal governments. For political purposes within Australia this rampant new internationalism is a device for transferring power from democratically elected governments to foreign bureaucrats who have no constituency within this country. It portrays a total lack of nerve or confidence which is at odds with the government's newly found nationalism and independence.

         Another example of this use of the external affairs powers, which also involves the Greenpeace organisation, relates to an attempt by that group to halt the construction of a power station in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Greenpeace has admitted that it is attempting to enforce an international convention, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in doing so set aside decisions made by democratically elected bodies.

         What do these issues have in common?  They focus attention on the simple fundamental question: is Australia a master of its own destiny or do our democratically elected state and federal governments have to be constantly second-guessing whether or not their legislation is going to measure up to the wishes of some group of bureaucrats in New York or in Geneva?  These people are not accountable to Australians through the ballot box. They often come from countries with besmirched reputations, countries which at best have but a nodding acquaintance with the democratic forms and procedures which have formed part of the Australian way of life for so long.

          Ignorance of the law is no excuse, but it is a great pity that we do not do more to educate people about the law and about the rules which operate. I am referring chiefly to matters of social security. In the last 12 months or so I have had numerous complaints from parents who could not have been expected to know that if they took their children overseas they would lose welfare benefits. I had the very sad case of a lone parent who had to undergo a very serious operation. When she came out of hospital she found it impossible to care for her nine-year-old daughter. So her sister in New Zealand rang and said, `Send Jenny across to me. You can't care for her. Send Jenny across to me for a month until you get back on your feet. I will look after her. I will pay her way across to New Zealand.' That arrangement was made but this lady, who exists only on welfare payments, discovered that she had to pay the Department of Social Security a couple of hundred dollars because she was not eligible for the family allowance she had been receiving for her daughter. There are many cases of that nature.

I know that every member of this House would have encountered some poor being in their office telling a story along these lines: `I will never work again. I am a complete cripple. I used to have a good job, but I was injured in a car accident. I am 43 years of age. After I was injured in the car accident I was in hospital, had all any hospital debts—doctors fees, et cetera—and they told me that I would get compensation, through third party insurance. Finally, after a protracted period of maybe two years of hardship living on the social security payment, I got the princely sum of $200,000 compensation. So what did I do? I am 43 years of age with a wife and a kid, and was renting a house. So I bought a new house that cost $125,000. We have never had a car so I bought a car.' The money was spent very wisely, but what happened then? Nobody told this poor devil—and there are many poor devils who have seen me regarding these matters—that Social Security could send a great lumping bill and say, `Hey, mate, all those social security payments have to be refunded.'

         —I wish to make a statement of appreciation for those involved in the successful campaign to construct an international length runway at Badgerys Creek in Sydney's south-west. This campaign for the past three years has involved local government leaders, business leaders, members of the community and state and federal MPs. It has been a tremendous effort. But our appreciation and congratulations lie most substantially with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who has been able to turn this issue around within five months to do the planning and, most significantly, to get the allocation of $73 million in the white paper to build a 2,900-metre runway.

         But this is not the first time that the minister, in a federal or state capacity, has produced the goods for Sydney's west. He has been at the centre of the great campaigns in our region over the last 20 years. The man who got the beds for the west as a state minister in the mid-1980s is now getting the jobs for the west in the mid-1990s through the Badgerys Creek airport project.

         This is very significant, because the only other major campaign for our region has been the establishment of the University of Western Sydney. At that time, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith was a minister in the Unsworth government which produced the outcome needed to develop that regional facility. In the 1980s, there was growth in the number of hospital beds. In the 1990s, jobs are coming to the region through the development of the international airport. This is the sort of policy outlook that we have always needed in Sydney's west and south-west. I am very pleased that this quality decision has come from a quality minister.

         —I will today tell the House about the extraordinary set of priorities of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). It now seems that students will have to learn how to pay tax, how to become identified through a tax file number and how to claim Austudy. We now have this wonderful thing called `Paying Tax', which is a kit that has been sent out to all secondary schools. It seems that the government's priorities are quite extraordinary. Where is the kit on how to earn a living, get a job or run a business? It seems that all Labor is interested in is teaching kids at school how to pay tax.

         It ought to be remembered that it is not just in the dictionary that the word `employment' comes before the word `tax'. Clearly, it seems that the government has given up on tax simplification. The number of pages in the tax act in the last 10 years has more than doubled to 5,000. I defy even a university professor to understand exactly what is in it.

         It clearly seems that the government has failed to make the tax system comprehensible. Now it wants to replace important learning time in schools with this extraordinary new kit. It comes complete with a video and overheads. It even has cartoons, just to make sure that people know what this word `tax' is. Maybe it should not be taken as seriously as some think. Is this what the tax office is about when it says `building a better Australia'? Some building; some Australia! What an extraordinarily sad set of priorities.

         When I was growing up and learning about politics, the Liberal Party supposedly stood for certain things. Apart from its economic belief in market capitalism, the Liberal Party was supposed to believe in freedom of speech, the rights of the individual and, in particular, the supremacy of individual rights over the power of the state. Everything to do with the power of the state was evil.

         Let us look at the situation in Tasmania with the outrageous anti-gay laws. The United Nations has made some comments condemning the Tasmanian gay laws. As soon as somebody in the federal government suggests that perhaps we need to look at them, what do we hear from the federal coalition? All we ever hear from these people is states rights.

         —On 27 May the present Australian contingent serving with the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia is due to return home after seven months in appalling conditions. United Nations travel guidelines require that the return journey be at the cheapest level, but only 10 economy seats are available on the direct flight back for 38 troops. Apparently no-one in the United Nations command thought to book far enough ahead. As a consequence, the other 28 soldiers would have to travel business class. They have been asked to personally pay the $150 difference from the economy fare. The only alternative is a round-the-world return journey, which could take up to three days. Although land force command in Sydney has some informal knowledge of the situation, the United Nations command has given no official advice of the problem. That Australian troops should be treated in this manner is a disgrace. The government must rectify the matter immediately.

         The government should also move to end the prolonged indecision as to whether Australian troops serving in Somalia are to receive the Australian Service Medal or the Australian Active Service Medal. It would be most appropriate if members of the current contingent receive the medal decided upon as a group when they come home.

When I walk to work here of a morning, I pass the building in Barton which is the headquarters of the Liberal Party. Recently it has been tarted up a little bit. Bits and pieces have been added to it. What is happening there is very symbolic. What the Liberal Party has done to this old building—built in the 1950s or 1960s of nice red brick with little windows—is added nice red bricks and little windows.

         What the Liberal Party has done is exactly what we expect from it. It cannot change; it cannot adapt. It continues with the same old thing—tarting up old policies and old buildings. I believe it will be opened on 23 June. This is very symbolic of the party. It wants the same old thing. It does not want any change. It does not want to adapt. Whenever a policy comes out, whatever it does, it wants to do the same thing and never change.

         I always used to enjoy this little walk. The sign on the front has gone now. Members of the Builders Labourers Federation worked on this building. On the front of the building a sign read `no ticket, no start'. It was quite ironic that here was the Liberal Party constructing the same old sort of edifice with the same bricks, the same building, the same doors, the same windows, and it had to use good old workers—not like the Australian Labor Party: we have new buildings and new policies; we are prepared to adapt and change.

Millions upon millions of taxpayers' dollars was squandered by those governments in deals with their big business mates, many of whom have now disappeared overseas, and it is most disappointing that those responsible for losing the money—money which should have been spent on schools, hospitals, police, improving our sewerage system and so on—have not been brought to account.

         The question must be asked: when this money was being squandered why did any cabinet minister not put his or her foot down and ask, `Where the hell has the money gone?' One must ask, when Burke and Dowding were gone, why did the next Labor Premier not have the guts to call a royal commission there and then? My office is often being called by people outraged at having to pay a WA Inc. levy. I say to them, `It is Burke, Dowding and Lawrence's fault. They lost your money. They didn't have the honesty to pursue the truth and Western Australian taxpayers are suffering in the hip pocket for the WA Labor Party's corruption,' which is the most corrupt government in this nation's history.

Then Mr Kennett's mate Mr Walker gets the Grand Prix down there. Where is the Grand Prix going to go? It is to be built and run on private land at Albert Park Lake, and it happens to be very close to Mr Walker's new proposed casino. So you can imagine where the people will be staying when they go to the Grand Prix, which Mr Walker—who owns the casino and is Mr Kennett's mate—runs. The Grand Prix will not go to Phillip Island where there is already a track or Sandown; it will go to Albert Park Lake. Who owns Albert Park Lake? The people. Who is going to give it to a private person? Mr Kennett. Why is he going to do this? Because he has his hand in Mr Walker's pocket or Mr Walker has his hand in the pocket of Mr Kennett—one of the two.

         —I was asked this question at the Press Club earlier today and I gave the very simple answer that on budget night all will be revealed about what the government is doing on these things. The question implies that in some way there is some discretionary spending on the government's part which it must be bound to cover by a tax increase of some kind. Any society which values all of its people having an opportunity to work and to participate in the growths, fruits and prosperity of the society will recognise that a program of the kind outlined yesterday satisfies both the criteria of economic efficiency and equity, that is, equity on the basis that unemployed people are entitled to participate in the labour market, and on the basis that to have 360,000 people unemployed for 12 months or more is a drag on the efficiency of the national economy and skills formation. As we go into a stronger recovery we will need that complement of skills. So I would regard the package, even from the opposition's point of view, as something that the government should reasonably have done and, therefore, the doing of it a legitimate cost on the nation and the budget of the Commonwealth.

         The implication of the question is that we should not be doing these things and that, if we do them, why are we not paying for them, and how? The opposition has disagreed all the way along with the government's fiscal strategy, a strategy which has now produced four per cent growth for the year. We are growing as fast as, or faster than, any other industrial country. We have already seen an increase in job growth of 250,000 over the year.

         —By way of interjection, the Leader of the Opposition says, `What about interest rates?' Is he arguing that the marginally lower financing effect of $1.7 billion on the budget is not, in macro-economic terms, more than compensated for by greater efficiencies from the major micro-economic reforms of the labour market? Of course it is. The Leader of the Opposition is directing questions to me about interest rates. As he knows, at the moment there is not a lot of rationality in interest rate settings in the marketplace of this country and appealing to their vanity with a lower budget deficit, lower than it might have otherwise been, is simply not on.

         —I think I might be able to manage that. There are two particular initiatives in the white paper which will go a long way towards improving the lot of small business and its operations in this country. The first is an acceleration of the simplification program for the Corporations Law. This program, which has been operating since the end of last year, has been well received by the community generally, particularly by the small business community with regard to that proposal dealing with the simplification of the rules governing exempt proprietary companies. Those are the 800,000-odd companies which are predominantly the vehicles from which many small businesses take their form. Removing a number of the requirements placed upon those companies in terms of the paperwork, the returns and the forms they need to supply to the ASC takes a lot of the burden off small business and should do a lot towards reducing costs. Acceleration of the program will allow more targeting of areas within the Corporations Law for simplification and should allow us to achieve our goals at a faster rate.

         The second initiative concerns major reforms to the way we deal with delegated legislation, that is, regulation. Many business organisations and individual business people often point to the unnecessary red tape, unnecessary regulation or regulation which may have had an aim at one point but which outlived its usefulness a long time ago.

         Combined with the establishment of the register, there will be provisions to periodically and systematically review regulation. Those provisions will ensure that when further regulation is made an adequate consultation process will be entered into, particularly with business. There will be effective analysis of the cost and benefit of the regulation and of whether there are alternative ways of achieving the same social end without unnecessarily putting a burden on business. There will also be improvements in the drafting of regulations so that it is consistent with the overall thrust towards plain English and simplified drafting.

The point of it is to give these people a chance to be case managed, to be assessed, and to understand what their work experience has been, what their educational attainments have been, where their suitability lies, what sort of training they might have, and what job placement might be available to them and where. This means that a group of people who would not otherwise be able to enter the labour market will be able to do so. They will have the chance to go into the mainstream labour market, the increase in which will be met from the product of the economy—employment.

         I remind the House that in the period between 1983 and 1989-90 the economy grew, on average, by about 4 1/2 per cent a year. The prospect is that, with a more flexible economy today, the economy could grow even faster. Over that period, we have had a job growth of just on two million. So with a recovery of the dimension we have today and with the prospects of it continuing, with low inflation, the aggregate employment coming to the economy will take up the new entrants to the work force and those people who, as a result of the white paper yesterday, will be case managed, assessed, trained and given a chance to take a place in the labour market.

         The notion about redirected jobs, by interjection and by inference from the question, is the notion of saying, `Leave them behind, don't worry about them.' In responding to me when I said, `We should leave an arm out and drag the unemployed up behind us,' this is the man—the Leader of the Opposition—who said, `If you leave an arm out and drag the unemployed up behind us, you'll drag the rest of us down.' That is the view: forget them, chop them off, do not worry about them, basically oppose them being given an opportunity and try to cloak the argument in saying, `Oh well, they'll take someone else's job.'

This is the same person who, over 18 months ago, said that the aged pensioners had to mix it with the `riffraff' at the Social Security offices; these were the unemployed. The honourable member for Bradfield refers to them as riffraff. The Leader of the Opposition said, `If you try to pull them up, they'll pull you down.' Then they say, `Don't give them any jobs, you'll redirect jobs away from other people.' That just illustrates the absolute duplicity and indecency of members of the Liberal Party in their attitude to the unemployed and why so many Australians just will never accept the fact that we do not want a dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-fittest society. When they ran that out at the last election they were defeated, as they would be again on the sentiments they are expressing in their question today.

It has also changed the tax treatment of instruments, such as infrastructure bonds and pool development funds, so that for particular classes of important infrastructure for regions it is possible for a regional group to actually raise some of the capital in the private finance markets of Australia through these instruments in yesterday's white paper.

         Just as with telecommunications and the competition among Telecom, Optus and the private providers of telecommunication services are managed in a market by Austel, the government will set up a body to manage a competitive market to complement the work of the CES in providing private case management in this country. Case management may have a particular focus on the metal industries or on the tourism industry. As a consequence, we could develop and find a very effective complement in the labour market to the provision of case management and job placement.

         The government has made clear that around 500,000 people will be case managed in 1994-95. Over the course of the year the case load of case managers will, outside of the compact, be about 250 people and, within the compact, about 125 people. This will involve something like 2,500 people to 3,000 people in the process. From the top of my head, I cannot remember exactly how many additional people that requires over the case load which the CES currently undertakes, but it is a substantial and revolutionary change to the labour market, to the delivery of labour market programs and to the placement of the long-term unemployed into work and into training. It will be money well spent in giving this country equity in the labour market and a sense of social cohesion and justice that has always been denied by coalition governments.

I think that is a very important target to impose upon ourselves for a whole range of reasons, but not least to ensure a continuation of the productive growth in the economy that we have had to this point. The government is confident that all measures, both in the white paper and in the budget, will ensure that those targets are met.

         As a proportion of GDP, Australia already has the third lowest government outlays among OECD countries. Using comparable OECD figures, general government total outlays in this country amount to about 38 per cent of nominal GDP. About two-thirds of that would be Commonwealth outlays. Out of the 19 major OECD countries, only the US and Japan have lower proportions and they are at around 35 per cent. In other comparable countries, outlays are around 50 per cent of GDP or higher.

The United Kingdom has said that it hopes to balance its books not by 1996-97, or even 1997-98, but by the end of this century. Canada—again, a country that we are being invited to pay attention to, because of its current deficit reduction strategy—is targeting a deficit of three per cent of GDP by 1996-97.

         —The government made it very clear in the statement that it has changed the taper and incentives so we do not have a position where people who earn one dollar of income lose it from their unemployment benefit. In a milestone change, instead of income testing two people as one, we are giving the half married rate unemployment benefit to each partner of a couple. As a consequence of having a diminished taper of 70 per cent and couples being separately income tested, the person who is unemployed—the husband, if the wife is at home—will not be in the former position where an increase in private income actually diminished the total payments of unemployment benefit to the family.

         What will happen now is that a breadwinner, a husband, can earn $230 a week above the benefit. As a consequence, not one dollar will come from the spouse's benefit.

         —Most of the attention to the white paper has been quite properly given to the labour market reforms. There are also included in that white paper some very significant reforms in respect of government purchasing policies. As all honourable members know, the government purchases something like $12 billion worth of goods and services a year. As the Bevis committee report—one of the most outstanding reports I think this House has seen in many years—points out, developing a proper industry policy in relation to government purchasing is going to have a very significant economic impact indeed.

         Small to medium businesses were given a lot of attention in the Bevis report because they were complaining, quite rightfully so, that they were disadvantaged to some extent by the current guidelines on government purchasing policy. The white paper goes a long way to meeting those complaints by small business. I will summarise those provisions in the white paper that give assistance to small and medium sized enterprises in Australia. The first provision is the introduction of a series of arrangements to facilitate purchases from small and medium enterprises.

         The second is the development of the two-envelope tendering system for acquisitions valued at more than $10 million. This is a system that will require people tendering for contracts to place two envelopes in the tender process, one of which has an industry development policy in it. This will focus the minds of those tenderers very much on the  development of that policy. We feel that that recommendation of the Bevis report will be very advantageous indeed, particularly to small business.

         Also there was a recommendation establishing an endorsed supplier approach for common day-to-day purchases of information technology and major office machines and a requirement that the government agencies prepare industry impact statements for major acquisitions valued at more than $10 million not covered by common use contract arrangements. The Bevis committee recommended that that figure be $30 million. I am sure it would be pleased that the government has actually decided to bring it in at $10 million. So there are a number of measures for small businesses, including a supplier development program that aims to further improve the understanding of suppliers about the Commonwealth government marketplace and to improve their skills in dealing with Commonwealth government departments.

I bring this to the attention of the House because I think it might have been overlooked in recent media reports.

Part of what the government did yesterday was about that, particularly for adolescents.

In the last decade this government has worked hard to create a very positive climate for Australian industry and investment. If we look back at the reforms that have taken place, we see that we have a more open economy because this government has been prepared to float the dollar, to allow new banks into Australia, to lower protection and to carry out the micro-economic reforms that were needed. These are all the things that he was telling the honourable member for Bennelong to do—but you were always afraid to roll it up to the Fraser cabinet to try to persuade it to implement these reforms. It has been the Labor government that has been prepared to carry out the tough reforms in aviation, telecommunications and all of the other areas. As a result of this, we can claim that inflation, interest rates and, of course, corporate tax rates are lower than they have ever been.

         The March balance of payments is showing strong recovery already. Imports of capital goods, which mainly consist of machinery, industrial equipment and data processing equipment, were up by 35 per cent. So there is already a clear indication that things are improving. The white paper contained a whole series of measures that will also help to improve the climate for investment. We have changed the regime for infrastructure bonds so that aviation projects such as water and sewerage infrastructure projects can be eligible.

         There are already a number of examples where companies have relocated to Australia. Data General has made Sydney its headquarters for all of its data processing for the Asia-Pacific region, and that has been worth millions of dollars not only for Telecom, which is providing the company's communications hub, but also for Australian software suppliers, as it is generating more jobs for Australian software engineers. The white paper also seeks to ensure that we are improving the regime for EFIC. We are establishing Ausindustry, a new one-stop shop, to try to ensure that companies can get advice on government assistance.

         Finally, we can also say that the white paper provides a bonus to the tourism industry by, for the first time, allowing the bulk of the tourism industry—those that provide single services—to have access to export market development grants. This will provide an extra boost to the tourism industry in promoting Australian holidays offshore. It is worth $9 million after the third year. That should ensure we have more Australian holidays marketed under Australian brand names on foreign shelves, and that has to be a good thing for jobs in Australia.

         —Listen to the answer. Unemployment is around 6 1/2 per cent and the view of many people in the US economy is that the US is reaching its potential in terms of employment—there is near full employment. As a consequence of this, given the fact that American fiscal policy plays a relatively small role in public policy because of the incapacity of the Congress to change it, much of the load has fallen to American monetary policy. Therefore, observing the  growth and inflationary prospects, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, Mr Greenspan, and his board have increased interest rates from three to 3.75 per cent.

         That is just slightly above the inflation rate, whereas in Australia the 90-day bill rate was 4.75 to five per cent off an inflation rate of under two per cent. We had a real rate on the short end of around three per cent; the US had a real rate on the short end of around one per cent. Therefore, it was not unnatural for the United States to increase its interest rates in an environment where it believes its resources are more fully employed. This is not so in Australia, with employment around the levels that we have them and with a lot of plant and equipment underused and not near full capacity. We had two totally different circumstances.

         So what happened? The lemmings of the bond market sold their bonds. When people sell a bond—let me explain this in ABC terms—and the price goes down, the yield goes up. When the bond gets less valuable, the yield rises for a given coupon. Do you understand that? Therefore, out of absolute failure to understand the differences between the two economies, lemming-like, they sell their bonds and the yields rise.

         The government is supposed to say, `Oh well, in that case we will go over the cliff with the lemmings. We won't worry about the half a million people who are unemployed; we won't worry about a more efficient micro-economic change in the labour market; we won't worry about skill shortages in a recovery; we won't worry about complements to skill formation. We'll spend the money reducing the budget deficit.' Meanwhile, there is no guarantee that there will be any change in interest rates. The people who are now talking their book, having sold the bonds cheaper, are no longer going to commit themselves to the fact that they can take a lower interest rate. If they take a lower interest rate, it means the price of the bond rises. So that magnifies the mistake which they have already made. So they are talking their book. You want to regard the fact that they are talking their book as some sort of highly spiritual mystic science. But the rest of us have to say, `Oh well, they're a free financial market. They must have got it right.' Grow up! For God's sake, grow up!

         —The white paper that was brought down yesterday in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is all about spending, training and politics; it is not about jobs. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the response to unemployment, the most significant social problem confronting this country today, by the Prime Minister yesterday was fundamentally flawed on four major counts. Firstly, it does nothing to create real jobs; it just worries about protecting one job, and that is his job. Secondly, it will only shuffle the unemployment queues and, unfortunately, it will probably work to lengthen those queues. Thirdly, it is unfunded. Fourthly, it will inevitably lead to higher interest rates and higher taxes, which will ultimately cost jobs. The response shows yet again that the Labor Party cannot solve the unemployment problem which it created because, quite simply, the Labor Party itself is the problem.

         The Prime Minister tried desperately yesterday to put himself alongside Ben Chifley. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that he failed and he failed abysmally. Forty-nine years ago Ben Chifley's white paper clearly committed his government to full employment. Ben Chifley put the light on the hill and committed his government to full employment, yet yesterday our Prime Minister gave up on full employment. The white paper was his white flag of surrender on full employment. Ex-Senator Peter Walsh got it right when he said that the Prime Minister is once again mouthing Chifley rhetoric as a poor substitute for sharing his beliefs, especially his belief that economic growth has a paramount role in improving the life of ordinary Australians. Chifley's voice is once again being muffled by the Zegna suits.

         The strange thing about the Prime Minister's failed attempt yesterday to associate himself with Ben Chifley is that I remember not all that long ago, just a few years ago, it was the same Prime Minister who was happy to cause something of a brawl within his party by calling Ben Chifley a plodder. We will all remember when Placido Domingo called Ben Chifley a plodder. Now it suits the Prime Minister to associate himself with Ben Chifley because he is absolutely desperate to win back the so-called true believers who have left the Labor Party since the last election.

         The fact is that the white paper has nothing to do with the Chifley Labor tradition, but it has everything to do with the Whitlam Labor tradition. Gough Whitlam has been his tutor, not Ben Chifley. The Prime Minister has been introduced to the idea that when he does not have a policy he pretends that the problem can be solved by throwing more and more money at the problem. That white paper in the House yesterday was all Whitlam, and I have to say that it was Whitlam without style. The Prime Minister has been boasting for months how innovative and how clever this statement was going to be. There was nothing innovative in it at all. It was just a lazy Whitlam copycat—another big spending spree—and, as the Prime Minister would say, it was low altitude stuff.

         The white paper has been made necessary by one single fact: this Labor government has presided over the most disastrous failure of economic policy in the postwar era. It was Labor's policy failure that resulted in the worst recession and the highest rate of unemployment in Australia since the Great Depression. But beyond the raw statistics, the Labor policy failure has also had a devastating set of social consequences in terms of family breakdown, homelessness, rising crime rates, and the creation of a permanent underclass. The legacy of Keating's Labor is the permanent underclass of unemployed.

         These facts, and these facts alone, explain why there is a white paper at all. It is all about Paul Keating the Prime Minister trying to make up for Paul Keating the Treasurer. It is the Prime Minister's belated and, I would have to say, totally inadequate response to the social and economic disasters that he personally caused. No-one should ever forget that fact. I do not believe that anybody ever will.

         This white paper is not what the government has been promising to deliver for quite some time because, as is usually the case, it has once again fallen well short of the expectations that the Prime Minister and his ministers set out to create. Last year, for example, we were promised not one but three major statements—three separate big bang statements—one on industry policy, one on regional development policy, and one on unemployment policy. After all that hype, what did we get? The new industry strategy and the much vaunted regional development strategy have been tossed by the wayside. We now simply have an employment statement, with industry policy initiatives that are nothing short of a total cop-out, and with a regional development initiative that looks more like taxpayer funded public relations exercises on the government's behalf rather than any genuine attempt to reinvigorate the desperate and neglected areas of regional and rural Australia.

         The attempt to deal with Australia's unemployment crisis in this white paper will take us, I believe, one step forward but two steps back. It is not a white paper about employment. It is not a white paper about growth. It is a white paper about training schemes and it is all about hiding the unemployed. This is absolutely classic Labor in terms of its response to the unemployment problem. Labor created the problem, then ignored it, tried to fudge it, tried to conceal it, and then threw money at it but, of course, Labor cannot and never will solve it. It will never solve the unemployment problem it has created.

         The tragedy is that this white paper tries to address a national unemployment crisis that should have been avoided. We did not need to have the recession. Australia—with our people, our talents and our resources—should never endure entrenched mass unemployment as it is at the moment. There is only one reason for unemployment in the 1990s: the total mismanagement and the total policy failures of this government under Paul Keating's policies as Treasurer and Paul Keating's policies as Prime Minister.

         As the Secretary to the Treasury, Ted Evans, said recently, the record levels of unemployment and the social consequences being endured by Australians were a clear matter of choice. Let me emphasise it, `a clear matter of choice' by this government. The government chose 10 per cent plus unemployment and it chose to put almost half a million Australians out of work for more than a year. It made that choice in preference to putting other policies in place that would have brought about different outcomes. Yesterday, most disturbingly, it reconfirmed that choice because it failed to change the policies that caused the problem in the first place. Once again the arsonist Keating would have us believe that he can now play fireman. Nobody is going to be fooled by that. Having lit the raging fires of unemployment, he is now making a big man of himself by trying to put them out with buckets of other people's money and buckets of words. I was amazed yesterday he did not drown in all that rhetoric.

         It is very important that we recognise that this is a longstanding approach by this government. In fact, this is Labor's 25th attempt in a bit over 10 or 11 years to actually deal with the problem. It has had 11 budgets, nine May economic statements, three prime ministerial statements, and the notorious One Nation statement. This Labor government can look back on a record that is a disgrace for a so-called Labor government, and on a record that has been a clear-cut disaster for Australia. It has given us the worst recession in 60 years. It has given us record levels of unemployment and it has given us a decline in real wages for Australian workers. How can they call themselves a Labor government? What an amazing trifecta for a so-called Labor government. This Prime Minister recently condemned himself and his government out of his own mouth when he said:

        He has been damned out of his own mouth because that statement, that quote, provides a clear-cut benchmark against which this Prime Minister's unemployment record and this white paper must be judged.

         The facts are very clear. Under the Prime Minister's policies Australia already has, and has had for some time, hundreds of thousands of people unemployed. There are 200,000 people who have been unemployed for two years or more, 350,000 people who have been unemployed for one year or more and 360,000 women who are unemployed. Just over 900,000 Australians are unemployed. This Prime Minister has failed utterly by his own standards of assessment of his government's performance.

         But the consequences of Labor's disastrous employment record go well beyond those very bland economic statistics, devastating as those statistics are. It is the social consequences of Labor's mass unemployment that will always be what this Labor government is remembered for—and I believe it is what they will be condemned for. Creating one million unemployed and then virtually doing nothing about it has had the effect of significantly increasing some of our worst social problems: family breakdown, homelessness, health problems, drug and alcohol abuse and crime rates. We are facing, I think, the possible creation of a permanent underclass in this country. ACOSS, the Salvation Army and the Brotherhood of St Laurence all agree that poverty in Australia is created—and I emphasise `created'—by unemployment. The despair, financial strain, family problems and loss of personal dignity caused by unemployment lead to chronic social problems that undermine our basic Australian values of equity and a fair go for all.

         The government is always avoiding addressing these issues. It never wants to talk about the social consequences of unemployment. The white paper yesterday had precious little to say about these at all. If, indeed, we go back to the bigger document, the green paper on unemployment that was released late last year—a document of some 240 pages—only one paragraph dealt with the social consequences of unemployment.

         In a broader sense, this white paper must be seen in the context also of the cynical abuse of the people's trust that this Prime Minister has made his hallmark. The government has always promised the earth and consistently failed to deliver. It has always made, and knowingly made, claims about its own policies which it knew would be misleading and which it knew to be wrong. The Prime Minister, for example, is always saying that our problems are about to be solved and that he has a solution that will cost little or nothing and we should not worry about the detail. What he has delivered, of course, as I have said, is a recession, unemployment, more taxes and less investment.

        In 1988 he told everyone that we were well on the way back to prosperity when, in fact, we were in nothing more than a boom-bust cycle. It was a time when he was boasting that his budget was the one that would bring home the bacon—another porky from the king of porkies. He told everyone then, in February 1990, that there would be no recession and that we were going to have what he called `a soft landing'. This was at a time when the number of unemployed people already stood at over half a million. Only six months later in the 1990 budget, when the number of unemployed then exceeded 600,000, he told everyone that economic policy was working—and I emphasise what he said—`without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession'. That, without qualification, is a disgraceful lie. What callous insensitivity from the man who yesterday spoke of fairness and compassion, and berated us in here today about the issue of compassion.

         He went on later and surpassed himself. He said, `These are definitely the golden years of change.' `Of course they were the golden years of change,' he said. They certainly were not the golden years of change for the 840,000 Australians who were out of work at the time of the next budget in 1991. Indeed, it took until the 1992 budget—by which time there were 940,000 Australians who were unemployed—for Labor to finally acknowledge the reality of mass and retrenched unemployment. By the time it did, Australia was already in a national crisis of unemployment which it has not yet recovered from. Yesterday, the man who has been responsible for more political confidence tricks than anyone else put his hand over his heart and did it again: he made another great promise to the people of Australia. Mark my words, it is another promise that he will break as soon as it suits him.

         This white paper is more about positioning Paul Keating politically than having anything to do with any genuine attempt to fix the unemployment crisis that his policies have created. For him, the main purpose of the white paper is very clear: to fudge the reality of Australia's unemployment problem and to devise ways of moving people from unemployment out of the labour force altogether and, thus, to artificially reduce the measured level of unemployment. The Prime Minister made a lot of promises yesterday, but the fact is that nobody believes our Prime Minister any more. You know something: they are dead right not to believe him.

         You will remember that One Nation promised $8 billion worth of tax cuts. They were entrenched in law, I remember, l-a-w tax cuts, for those who doubted the Prime Minister's word. He promised an investment avalanche. He promised that the budget deficit would rocket back into surplus by 1995-96. Straight after the election, of course, the magnitude of that con became very clear: over half the tax cuts were immediately ditched, investment hit a 40-year low—hardly an avalanche—and the budget was firmly back in deficit for many years to come.

Only $1.1 billion of the $6 1/2 billion worth of promised expenditure is going to be delivered in the next 12 months. True to form, the Prime Minister wants the credit for the $6 1/2 billion, but he has to make his budget look responsible. He knows he cannot, and he never will, deliver the $6 1/2 billion. Just watch him. He will talk his head off in coming months all over Australia about his great promises and his great spending—always talking about the $6 1/2 billion. But get ready. If he were to win the next election, it would not take long before he would be looking for the backdown. He would be looking for the backdown straight after that election. Just like more than half the tax cuts promised in One Nation and a host of other promises, much of this white paper would bite the dust because the government would not and could not pay for it.

         Moreover, this government has made an art form of distracting people's attention from the reality of Australia's unemployment problem. For years, the government has created a smokescreen of acronyms, name changes and pots of gold at the end of any rainbow to obscure the real problem. We have had one grand labour market initiative after another. We have had CEP, SEP, EIS, special youth employment training, the adult wage subsidy scheme, jobstart mark 1, jobstart mark 2, jobtrain, ATS, NEIS, labour adjustment assistance, jobsearch, training programs, post-placement support, LEAP, CEEP, ATI, CAP and LAPs—and all of this is just the tip of the iceberg. If acronyms were jobs, there would not be an unemployment problem in this country. Since the government came to office over 11 years ago, it has introduced 45 new programs, all accompanied by the same hype, all being said to be saviours and all failing in the end, of course, to deliver what was promised. In this white paper even more unemployment schemes and acronyms have been created with the same hype and the same promises, if we know how to read them.

         After years of denying the reality of Australia's unemployment crisis, Labor has again decided to fudge and conceal the fact that it is not prepared to change its policies to solve the problem. The priority for Labor is to conceal the true extent of Australia's unemployment crisis. For Labor, as long as the unemployed are out of sight, they are out of mind. This is Labor's whiteboard strategy for the unemployed: list them on the whiteboard as unemployed, move them across to a job compact or training scheme, and then rub them out so they do not get counted in the unemployment numbers. Ben Chifley, I reckon, would turn in his grave.

If the growth is not forthcoming, the unemployed face the prospect of not only increasing in number but also going onto a needless merry-go-round, being moved from one training scheme to another but with no prospect of a job at the end.

         The government has also said that it is feasible to reduce the unemployment rate to five per cent by the year 2000. I think it is important to understand the magnitude of that task. An unemployment rate of five per cent by the year 2000 will require the government to generate something like 2 1/4 million jobs between now and then. That growth rate of five per cent has to be sustained in every year of the rest of the decade. Every time it falls short by one per cent, or 100,000 people, the government will fall short of its objective.

         I think we should be pretty pessimistic about those growth numbers because whatever way we look at the white paper, it is $2 billion of additional expenditure in every year. That is $2 billion that, unless it is properly funded, will be added to the deficit. By properly funded—we will not know, of course, until next week's budget—I mean by cuts in other expenditure or by increases in taxes. If it is not properly funded, the budget deficit will be $2 billion higher than it otherwise would be and interest rates will increase without a doubt. We do not need the first year economic lesson the Prime Minister tried to give us. Interest rates will go up if this is not properly funded. Interest rates going up works against the recovery, stifles investment and starts to destroy jobs that would otherwise be forthcoming. That is the downside of what was done yesterday.

         Let me conclude with a couple of comments on an appropriate growth strategy for unemployment. The centrepiece of any growth strategy has to be to improve the climate for medium and small sized businesses to begin to invest and to employ labour. I do not want to downplay the significance of big business, but the focus must be on small to medium sized businesses. If the Prime Minister wants to be champion of the unemployed, then he has to be champion of small business. Right now, for example, there are about 800,000 small businesses in Australia. Imagine if all of those businesses created just one job. That would make a substantial dent in the 900,000 unemployed. If we could get the system working and growing and new small businesses opening, there is no way we would fall short of what should be our objective; that is, anybody who wants to work in this country should be able to.

         The essence of a successful small business strategy will be to get the government off their backs and to reduce or eliminate the imposts levied by governments which increase the costs of employing labour or discourage them from investment. For example, we should not only scrap the training guarantee levy, we should also freeze the superannuation guarantee levy and streamline its processes. Steps should be taken to reduce the impact of other taxes like payroll taxes and others.

What about the idea of a small business bank, perhaps by hiving off the Commonwealth Development Bank from a fully privatised Commonwealth Bank? Over and above that, the investment climate for small business must be reinvigorated and cost disadvantages from transport, shipping, waterfront, communications and power must be reduced by accelerating the pace of reform.

         The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill that has just been introduced is an absolute disaster from the point of view of small businesses. It has had a very significant negative effect on their attitude to hiring staff. For example, many small businesses now find it preferable, and disturbingly so, to get their existing staff to work overtime rather than contemplate the possibility of hiring new people. The industrial relations legislation clearly has to be set aside if small businesses are to play the part they are entitled to play. Small business desperately needs a more flexible labour market if it is to survive, let alone expand.

         The third theme of the white paper quite rightly commits the government to ensuring that the long-term unemployed are not left behind during the current economic recovery. In previous recoveries, the vast bulk of new jobs—six out of every seven—went to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. That must never be allowed to happen again. Without new programs and policies to assist the long-term unemployed, they will be left behind again. That is totally unacceptable to this Labor government.

       Senator Schacht has a background in political bureaucracy and obviously measures administrative excellence by press releases. But if this is so important, let me correct the number. I have issued over 50 press releases on small business since undertaking my responsibility in that area. He also said:

       Unlike Senator Schacht, whose personal and present background has no small business involvement, I am still actively involved in the small business arena, dealing directly with all the regulations and charges such as increased fuel tax and sales tax that Senator Schacht has imposed on that sector. My contribution to the long-term unemployed is to give them jobs. I employ five apprentices and provide regular work experience opportunities to the unemployed. Numerous other opposition senators and members have a similar involvement. Senator Schacht also said:

        However, what I did say, which was in line with comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, was previously published in one of those press releases that Senator Schacht said I did not send out. That release said:

Thirdly, where is the investment? Finally, we are paying for it on Bankcard.

         There are also a couple of fudges involved here. There is a fudge on the unemployment figure—there is a fudge on the number of the unemployed themselves—and there seems to be a fudge on case managers, which clearly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could not address in question time today. Finally, I want to talk about the fact that in 11 years of Labor we have had these sorts of promises, we have had these sorts of overly optimistic expectations time and time again, and they are never met.

         It is most important to remember that training does not equal a job. If training was all that was required to have jobs, we would have no unemployment in this country at all. I guess as a country we have never really come to grips with what we do with 15- to 19-year olds. So we kid ourselves now that people without adequate training can suddenly take some short cut, that they can suddenly do some short six- or eight-week training course, and that we can churn out program after program and make up for years; we cannot. The nature of the training that is being offered will be necessarily short term.

         The government has not come to grips with the nature of the regional problem of unemployment. The fact is that between Coffs Harbour and Noosa there are well over 100,000 long-term unemployed Australians. That is not going to be fixed by any amount of job subsidy because the jobs are not there in the first place. We have also been told that after the period of training they will be offered a job.

         That is a bit optimistic, because what they will actually be offered is work for a period between six and 12 months, if they can find it. If it is not there, they will do some community work. That in itself may achieve very worthwhile social ends. Care for the aged or personal carers for the disabled will do a great deal of good in this country. But let us not kid ourselves that after this the long-term unemployed will suddenly have all their problems fixed. They will have a job for a period until it runs out, and then it will be up to them.

         The second problem concerns growth. We have never said that growth alone will fix the problem; it will not. The government's own green paper recognised this. The top of the second chapter states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . with suitable policies to promote economic growth, unemployment might be reduced as low as 5 per cent by the year 2000-01. In order to achieve a higher growth rate, policies would need to be directed toward increased flexibility in the labour market, income restraint, accelerated micro-economic reform and stronger productivity growth. Active labour market programs would also have a part to play in this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the trouble with the Public Service. When it does not like what we are doing it slips in those sorts of things in the report somewhere; they are buried. That is absolutely true. Without strong and sustained growth this is just a charade because the number of jobs is fixed.

         Yes, you can churn the jobs between the long-term unemployed and the short-term unemployed and that might actually achieve some social ends. But there are no more jobs, and there are losers, and the losers are the short-term unemployed who will become the long-term unemployed because of this.

         In the end, this problem is going to be fixed by investment. It is going to be fixed by businesses being prepared to spend money—not BHP, not CRA, but small businesses; farms and other small business people spending the money to re-equip, to retool. But it is not happening. Coming out of the last recession our investment was up 23 per cent. That saw a surge in growth, a surge in employment and a drop in unemployment. Coming out of this recession, investment is not up; it is down. Compare this to the United States. The US is coming out of the recession and its investment is up 12 per cent. Business is not stupid. It just does not have confidence in the future. It is not going to have confidence while the problem is massaged, while the problem is tinkered with, while part of the problem is fixed but the fundamental causes not addressed.

         We are paying for this on Bankcard; that is quite clear. We are paying for it on the never-never. Again, there may be very fine social ends that we are trying to achieve. But we do not achieve them if the net effect of what we do pushes up interest rates. That in itself will cost jobs. So in a perverse sort of way a white paper supposedly on jobs could end up costing jobs.

         The timing of this is all very interesting. We are 14 months into this parliament. Last year when the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), before he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, was talking about this package he said that it would be in before the end of the year. It is in in May, but we have to wait another seven to 14 months to see a lot of it implemented. The centrepiece of it, the jobs compact, really does not crank up until next year.

It does not take that long to make the decisions and the changes. The reason is pretty simple: next year is an election year. If we take long-term unemployed off the queues, put them onto training and give them a job for nine months they will vanish from the figures next year, but I tell you what—they will be back in 1996.

It said, `Watch the numbers very closely; they are going to be massaged.' Here is the massage. The jobs compact—160,000 in a full year lasting six to 12 months—will take about 120,000 at any one time off the figures. In regard to the parenting allowance, itself a worthy consideration, if half the 118,000 families come from the presently unemployed that will be 59,000 off the figures. An extra 1,250 places for CDEP will mean 1,250 Aborigines off the figures. A thousand new places for NEIS—they will come off the figures. There is to be an increase in the entry level training places of 25,000. Let us say there is a 70 per cent take-up of that. That is 17,500 people off the figures.

         In regard to the partners allowance, on the March figures there were 4,800 potential people eligible. Let us say that two-thirds of them are married and take it up. That is 3,200 off the figures. In regard to the mature allowance, introduced on 20 March, we do not know how many but the Department of Social Security newsletter tells us that 30,000 people have applied. They are people over 60, the long-term unemployed. They do not have a job and, quite frankly, under the current policy settings they do not have much prospect of a job. And what do we do?

         In the end this is going to come down to credibility. Looking back over 11 years of Labor, the rhetoric does not match the action. In the 1983 election campaign we had the opposition leader berating the fact that one in 10 Australians was out of work—in his words, `a figure no Australian would have believed possible and which no Australian government should ever be forgiven for'. That is true; the government will not be forgiven. Over time we have had a raft of programs and promises. It is important to run through them because it forms the basis on which we have to judge whether we are going to trust the present rhetoric.

We were going to have 100,000 youth trainees. By February 1986 we did not have one. In the end, 20,000 were created. A lot of money was spent on advertising and lunch with executives.

         The opposition's contribution in this House today has been so disappointing. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) came into the House and said that unemployment is a really important problem, but the coalition is not going to do anything about it. The coalition does not have any current proposals. Fightback is dead. Those opposite have no proposals to attack the problem of long-term unemployment or to get the economy growing strongly. What is the opposition's policy when it comes to the young unemployed? What is the opposition's policy when it comes to carers of children in the home who have unemployed spouses?

Fightback said that the unemployed should not continue to receive unemployment benefits after nine months. That is what the opposition wanted to do, simultaneously bringing in a 15 per cent GST on all the goods and services in our community, which would redistribute income from middle and low income earners to the well to do.

        He later said that what he wants is cuts to government expenditure so that we get `a smaller and more efficient and more responsive public sector'. As recently as November last year, the opposition was committed to very substantial cuts in public expenditure. What would that mean for the unemployed? It would have to mean that things like unemployment benefits would be terminated after nine months, as proposed in Fightback, and that we could not have massive expenditure of billions of dollars on labour market programs, the type of which are proposed in the white paper.

If we were to, say, move to the Korean model, it would require a cut in revenue of something like $33 billion. What would a cut in revenue of $33 billion mean for jobs and for government programs? It would mean the abolition of all the programs for labour and employment, plus education, plus health, plus industry assistance and most of the other areas in our program budgets.

When the opposition comes into this House and criticises the government for having a balanced program to generate growth through industry policy and for having labour market programs to make our work force more adaptive and productive, it really has not got a feather to fly with. There is no alternative economic policy emerging from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition says that we cannot spend money on labour market programs. We ask the opposition, `What is your solution? You do not believe in labour market programs. You are going to cut unemployment benefits after nine months. You do not believe in targeting to industry. What do you believe in?' The opposition says, `We believe in cuts to real wages. We believe in abolishing the industrial relations safety net, abolishing the award safety net and cutting real wages.'

         The remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at question time show that it is obvious he has not read the text of this white paper. As a result of this white paper, living standards of the unemployed who earn less than $100 per week will be reduced. It says it in black and white. There is even a table, which the Labor Party has obviously never looked at, illustrating how it plans to reduce the living standards of the poorest unemployed people in this country. This party talks about care and compassion, oozing all this unctuous nonsense from every pore. Its hypocrisy is really quite sickening.

         From our perspective, when coalition governments have been in power, we have aimed at quite simple things. We have aimed at not reducing wages or boasting that the accord has reduced wages—hooray!—or that the living standards of Australians, particularly lower income Australians, have fallen while we have been in power. We have had the ambition of increasing living standards. When we have been in government, we have achieved that. We have also aimed at achieving high rates of economic growth. In the main, when we have been in government, we have achieved that. The Labor Party always quotes the 1982-83 recession, which was a global recession, but it apparently never bothers to quote all of the many years when coalition governments in this country built up living standards.

         I have heard the Prime Minister say over and again—he was reported as saying this in the caucus—that this white paper is a Labor document. It is. It is a defeatist document. It is an apology for a policy from a party that has put one million Australians out of work. It is defeatist, unlike the work of Ben Chifley. He decided to introduce a white paper when he first became the Prime Minister, not years and years after he had been in power. The likes of Ben Chifley aimed to eliminate unemployment.

         This white paper is also a Labor document because it contains the old tax and spend formula. If the Labor Party sees a problem, it throws money at it. It happened in South Australia. Mr Bannon was in power there for years. He saw problems, and he had grand plans and schemes. Masses of money were shovelled out, and the state went broke. It happened in Western Australia with the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her various predecessors, such as Mr Dowding and Mr Burke or whoever. It happened in New South Wales and, par excellence, it happened in Victoria.

         —Shortly after the 1993 election, while honourable members opposite were in the spotlight, like rabbits, handcuffed to Fightback, together with some of my colleagues, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), I was a member of the government's caucus employment task force. We embarked upon work to present a submission to the expert committee on the green paper, which is headed by Dr Michael Keating, the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was our task to present a submission on what we regard as Australia's most pressing economic and social problem, long-term unemployment.

         Before I move to some of the items in our consideration, I think it is worth reminding the House what honourable members opposite stand for when they remain handcuffed to Fightback. At the moment we are not quite sure whether the key has been turned in the handcuff and the handcuff has fallen off or it is about to be slammed shut. In Fightback mark I, the attitude of honourable members opposite to long-term unemployment was that after nine months people were to be tipped off the dole. In Fightback mark II, when they became very wishy-washy, responding to opinion polls, when we looked at the fine detail we saw that they were committed to reducing outlays in spending on unemployed people by $800 million. In addition to that, we have their Jobsback package, which of course is simply a code for slashing wages.

He said, `They're taking up our training wage. Our training wage is their training wage.' That is not true. The training wage in Jobsback was not a training wage at all. It contained no requirement or provision for training; it was simply a device to do what those opposite want to do. Their solution to any economic problem, their solution to unemployment, is to slash wages.

         The solution of the caucus employment task force that I was a member of was fundamentally based on the following premise and policy: the solution to long-term unemployment was a growth-plus solution. In other words, economic growth by itself was not sufficient to take up the pool of long-term unemployed; we needed to maximise economic growth, but we also needed to take special steps and special measures to ensure that in the course of economic recovery long-term unemployed people were taken up.

        It is worth adding that we also have the lowest rate of industrial disputation in this country for over 30 years. The white paper goes on to refer to low inflation, our increased productivity, the corporate profit share being at a near all-time high, business confidence in manufacturing being at the highest level for more than 30 years, and world economic growth—particularly growth in east Asia—supporting further strong growth in our exports. Honourable members would be aware that currently one-third of our exports goes to these markets.

We also see reference to the incentives for investment and the changes that we have made to the tax system, which include dividend imputation, accelerated and expanded depreciation, and a corporate tax rate reduced from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Of course, at the last election those opposite wanted to jack up the corporate rate from 39 to 45, plus a 15 per cent GST.

        That is precisely what the industry policy section of the white paper envisages, and it is precisely what those opposite would oppose. The white paper reflects this government's ambition, and the ambition of those on this side, to ensure that Australia becomes a society and an economy which has high growth, high employment, low inflation, high productivity and high wages. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who say that the approach we should take in terms of long-term unemployment is either to do nothing or to present the solution to all our problems as the slashing of wages. We on this side say that we can and will achieve a society in Australia where long-term unemployed people share in the benefits of the economic recovery and where in the next decade we can maintain a high growth, high productivity and high wage society.

         A couple of weeks ago, Councillor Tully raised an objection with Queensland Rail about a billboard that I believe appears at one of its railway stations. It is an advertisement for women's underwear. It is a picture of a woman from about the armpits to the waist wearing only a brassiere, and the caption is `making mountains of molehills'. Councillor Tully objected to Queensland Rail accepting payment for advertisements of this nature on the grounds that it really does demean the dignity of women.

         I have been very interested to follow the debate—I have followed it silently until now—that has ensued. I have read letters on the subject to the editor of the

         —the newspaper that the Parliamentary Library unfortunately does not think too much of—and other newspapers that are available to me, and I have listened to talkback radio on the subject. It has been very interesting. I will give you a very rough breakdown, Mr Speaker, of the public reaction. Unanimously, men have disagreed with Alderman Tully, and they have used a variety of terms in their disagreement. Women's views have been split but, on the whole, the great majority of women have supported him. On the radio talkback programs on this subject that I have heard—so far as one can discern age from someone's voice—it always sounds very much to me as though it is younger women who say they do not think he should have raised this subject.

         I have been interested to hear the comments of those who have disagreed with Alderman Tully, particularly men who have disagreed with his views, because I was looking to anticipate a couple. I was waiting to hear the term `politically correct'. I was waiting to hear people say, `Oh, he is only saying this because it is politically correct.' `Politically correct' seems to have become the latest term of abuse for people who raise issues in relation to women. Once upon a time, the terms used in this particular topic that Alderman Tully has raised would have been `Mother Grundy' or `blue nose'; all those terms of abuse that women have had to put up with for years when they have raised objection to the public demeaning of women's dignity by advertisements such as this.

         There is a place for these sorts of advertisements. I would not mind them in a women's magazine or even in a newspaper lingerie advertisment. I would not mind them in their proper context but I, along with Alderman Tully—and I know many women of all ages would agree—object to this sort of advertising in a very public place such as a railway station. I am therefore very pleased to get up publicly as a Liberal and say that I agree with the Labor councillor from Ipswich. All strength to his arm. I hope he keeps at it.

         —I am going to speak very briefly tonight. I have been thinking about this for a long time since we changed the hours in this place and I must place publicly on record my total opposition to this 8.00 o'clock finish. I know the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will not agree with me, but I think it is an extraordinary waste of this parliament's time for us not to sit and I think it is an extraordinary waste of members' time. There are very few members—in fact, I can think of only two and they are the Canberra based members—who do not live outside the Canberra region. That means that the rest of us are here—not under sufferance but as part of a job—and my view is that there is absolutely no reason why we could not be sitting until 10.00, 10.30 or 11.00 o'clock at night, even until 10.00 o'clock with a half hour adjournment debate and then finishing at 10.30 p.m.

         There are a number of reasons why I would prefer this. My understanding is that staff losses have been involved in the catering section of this place, and I am deeply concerned about that. In many cases, that has been young people, people who are studying and people with part-time work. I believe other staff have lost hours and are losing income. That is one important part of my objection. I also believe that the culture of this place is changing and I am extremely concerned about that. I think it is not changing for the better, but for the worse. It might be all very well for the eating houses around Canberra; they might be quite happy with the 8.00 o'clock finish, but I think the culture is changing to the extent that the relevance of this place is diminishing and diminishing very dramatically.

         We have a situation now where it is virtually impossible to catch up with anyone in the dining room. As you know, Mr Speaker, it is bad enough trying to catch up with people in this place anyway, but now we have effectively lost the dining  room facility. Very few people are eating there; they are wandering off at 8.00 o'clock at night, disappearing into the Canberra night, never to be seen again. There is just not that chance for any interaction between members of the same side but, I think equally importantly, between members from opposite sides of politics. The great thing about the dining room was that there was an opportunity to speak to colleagues on the other side of the political fence.

        I am advised that the 1994 Australia Day Symposium  "Immigration and Integration: Germany and Australia"  was held in Berlin on 3 February 1994 and Potsdam on 4 February 1994. Sponsorship was on a joint German/Australian basis, but came principally from German agencies; namely, the Berlin Government Commissioner for Foreigners and the Brandenburg Commissioner for Foreigners. On the Australian side, the symposium was sponsored by the Australian Consulate-General in Berlin and Australian Embassy in Bonn. Support was also provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA), including its Bureau of Immigration and Population Research (BIPR); the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA); the Queensland Bureau of Ethnic Affairs; and the University of Melbourne.

The proposal for the 1994 symposium was jointly developed by Professor Dr Gerhard Leitner of the Free University of Berlin and the then Australian Consul-General in Berlin, Dr David Charles. The choice of themes for the 1994 symposium was reached after consultation with the Commissioners for Foreigners in Berlin and Brandenburg.
