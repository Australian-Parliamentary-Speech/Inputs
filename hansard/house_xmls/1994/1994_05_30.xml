          There are two main aspects of the inquiry. Firstly, the committee examined the role and function of the Law Reform Commission as a separate and permanent law reform agency. Secondly, the committee reviewed the relationships between the commission and other bodies with a law reform or related function.

          On the first point, we have concluded that the current role and functions of the Law Reform Commission are still appropriate. The independence and objectivity of the Law Reform Commission is founded in part in its statutory nature, and in part in the independent management and operations of the commission. The commission is an important source of independent advice for the government because of its capacity for accessing expert and representative opinion.

          The committee recognises that its national character is the distinguishing feature of the Law Reform Commission. In the federal context, the application of complementary laws of each Australian jurisdiction is an important development. It would be appropriate for the Law Reform Commission to be able to consider proposals for the complementarity of laws of the Commonwealth on the one hand and of the territories and the states on the other.

          The distinctive contribution that a permanent and separate law reform commission can make to the reform of the legal system lies in its capacity for detailed research, extensive consultation and critical analysis. With regard to the second aspect of this inquiry, the committee examined the roles of some of the statutory and non-statutory bodies which advise the federal government and considered the relationship each has with the commission. The committee found that there is value in providing a range and diversity of advice to the government, recognising the importance of current mechanisms in promoting cooperation between the Law Reform Commission and the other advisory bodies, and reducing wasteful duplication in their operations.

          The committee considers that there should be greater emphasis on promoting joint projects between the Law Reform Commission and state and territory law reform bodies. While the committee acknowledges that problems of a constitutional and jurisdictional nature may affect the selection of joint projects, the committee concludes that joint projects are both necessary and useful, because part of the role of a national law reform commission is to assist in the systematic development of the law.

          The committee considers that the influence of the work of the Law Reform Commission over almost 20 years has been very significant. In the years since the Law Reform Commission was established, a great deal of law reform work has been done, but the challenge continues. The need for law reform has not diminished. The implementation of our recommendations will lead to the correction of impediments to the smooth operations of the Law Reform Commission, and to the enhancement of its value to the Australian people.

          —There was general unanimity among members of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the Law Reform Commission. The report was fascinating and far reaching. It was a reference from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who requested the committee to report in a fairly quick period. The committee was unable to keep to the Attorney-General's timetable because there were lots of views on the role of the commission, its future and the purpose it has served over the past 20 years.

          The report today, however, includes extensive evidence that was taken by the committee. On balance, the committee decided that the only authority with a capacity to refer matters to the Law Reform Commission should be the Attorney-General. That was a unanimous view of the committee and one that was decided after the committee took evidence from the commission and other interested bodies.

          The clearer management structure proposed by the committee is something that will improve the efficiency and the timeliness of reports. One of the factors that has distressed those interested in law reform has been the sometimes extensive delays in the preparation of significant reports. Sometimes this is not a matter that has been brought about by the commission being tardy but, rather, by the Attorney-General loading additional references onto the commission. The management structure, in my view, appeared to be deficient in a number of areas, and this report seeks to rectify that.

          Another sensible proposal is the recommendation that experienced practitioners be appointed as consultants and advisers to the Law Reform Commission. It is my view that a couple of reports—perhaps three—which attracted a lot of adverse attention from the community really were brought about because of the predominance of an academic type of legal involvement. The committee has rightly recommended that practitioners—legal people dealing with the law and the processes of law on the ground day to day—should play a greater role in the activities of the commission.

          Some states have expressed the view that the Law Reform Commission has too readily involved itself in a wish to create uniformity and to overturn the interests of states in law reform. I have some sympathy with that view. It is my intention to write an expression of concern, which will be included in the report, indicating that the Attorney-General needs to adopt a great deal of care in making recommendations for the commission to research. There are so many areas needing law reform that the Australian Law Reform Commission has plenty of scope without straying into areas on the margin. We mentioned the need for complementary legislation. That is a new innovation for the commission to consider.

          Finally, I acknowledge the expression of concern by my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). He wished to see the Australian Law Reform Commission renamed as the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission. He also expressed concern about the production of draft legislation. The production of draft legislation by the Law Reform Commission is a lengthy process which takes a lot of resources and time, but it is an interesting and useful tool to the commission in the progress of its work.

          I believe that the Attorney-General ought to always have the right to ask the commission to produce draft legislation and that, as a tool, the commission ought to have the freedom of using draft legislation. It should not as a matter of practice develop the concept that draft legislation is the best way to have its will win the day. That is not what law reform is about, in my view. It is about putting up interesting proposals which over a period of time may or may not be adopted.

          —The report I have just tabled is the review of several audit reports by the committee. Audit report No. 36 was a project audit on ATSIC's provision of community infrastructure. The committee is satisfied with the departmental responses to the audit office's recommendations. However, there are two areas of particular concern to the committee. These are in relation to the decision making processes of the regional councils and the additional responsibilities and costs that might have been imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as a result of the changes in Commonwealth regulatory activities in relation to civil airstrips. Before moving to those issues, the committee commented that while it endorses the first key finding of the audit we believe that it does not go far enough. The audit office found:

         The respective responsibilities of Commonwealth, State/Territory and local Governments in the provision of community infrastructure to indigenous communities are unclear and ATSIC may be funding projects properly the responsibility of other levels of government.
        </para>
        <para>
         This finding is not new to the committee, which has been drawing attention to this problem for some time. The committee has gone further in previous reports and states that it is beyond doubt that in a great many instances ATSIC is funding services and projects which are the responsibility of state, territory or local governments. The committee is becoming increasingly impatient at the lack of action on many of the recommendations that have been made by the committee on this issue.

          The committee recommends that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) take urgent action through the Council of Australian Governments to ensure that the diversion of mainstream funding away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ceases and that he review the recommendations made by the committee on this matter over the last decade to ensure that they are being implemented. On the question of decision making by ATSIC regional councils, recommendation 5 of the audit report states:

         The ANAO recommends that ATSIC encourage Regional Councils to document reasons for funding.
        </para>
        <para>
         ATSIC strongly disagreed with this recommendation. It stated that regional councils are responsible for proposing the allocation of funds and the administrative arm is responsible for the assessment of projects and documentation and identifying need and does this as part of the current assessment process. There are two issues involved: whether reasons for regional council funding decisions should be documented in some way; and whether a regional council's decisions are reviewable by another agency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the second issue, the committee believes that the ANAO has erred in trying to impose bureaucratic accountability for political decisions that ATSIC regional councils have been elected to make. The committee believes that accountability should apply to the briefing and assessment prepared by ATSIC officers on projects which go before regional councils to assist them in making their decisions, and funds allocated to and disbursed by regional councils to ensure that they are spent in accordance with the ATSIC Act and the priorities of the regional plan as determined by the regional council.

          The committee does not believe that the decisions of regional councils, provided they are lawful, should be accountable in the same way as decisions made by public servants. Where approvals represent a significant departure from the priorities of the regional plan, the committee recognises that community acceptance would be assisted if the reasons for the decision are publicly announced.

          Having regional councils document their reasons for all funding decisions implies that decisions are subject to review by a superior agency. This would be contrary to the intent of the establishing legislation. The committee finds that, in making its recommendation, the ANAO did not take sufficient care in determining the intent of the ATSIC legislation. There are pitfalls for those who seek to assume a superior position from which to assess the `correctness' of political decisions. In the audit report, the ANAO makes itself the arbiter of the appropriateness of decisions made by the regional councils, by stating that:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . other needs, in the ANAO's view more pressing, were passed over.
        </para>
        <para>
         The committee believes that, given the legislated function of the regional council to make decisions, it is not appropriate for the ANAO to review the priorities determined by regional councils with respect to funding programs such as infrastructure projects. It is not a requirement imposed on federal cabinet, state cabinets or local government authorities to put in writing the reasons why some proposals were funded in the budget and not others. It is inappropriate to recommend that the ATSIC political structure should be required to do this when other levels of government do not conduct their political decision-making processes in this way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee recommends that ATSIC encourage regional councils to announce the reasons for funding decisions whenever possible. The opposition members of the committee, while agreeing on the remainder of the report, have dissented on this last recommendation. Whilst I leave it to them to explain their position, their recommendation seeks to further curtail the independence of the regional councils. I, along with other government members, am disappointed by the decision to dissent as we went to great lengths within the committee to try to accommodate all views and gain a consensus on the issue.

The committee had difficulties with the department's reasons as to why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities did not have equitable access to the scheme. There is clearly a lack of understanding by the department of the air service needs of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly those of out-stations. There is also a clear lack of understanding of the entitlements of such communities.

          This particular report causes us a lot of concern. We believe it is essential that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should see the result of all of the money that is being spent. All Australians are aware that the Commonwealth and the states are providing large sums of money for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As one goes around the country speaking to individuals and groups, one realises that there is widespread concern that it appears that a lot of that money is not getting down to the grassroots level. Last week, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the subcommittee dealing with the implementation of the royal commission recommendations visited a number of centres in Western Australia. We went to Broome, Karratha, Kalgoorlie and Perth.

          —The efficiency audit that is reviewed in the report I have just presented found a serious discrepancy in the development and delivery of an important government initiative. The audit dealt with the administration of the national energy management program that is managed by the department. The current program had its origins in an interim package of greenhouse measures announced in October 1990.

          The Department of Primary Industries and Energy was given the responsibility of implementing these measures. It responded by expanding its existing energy management program, which was by that time little more than a carryover from the 1970s oil shock. The expanded program came to include over 50 subprograms which varied widely in nature and scope and which shared extremely limited financial and human resources.

          Despite this expansion of the program, the department failed to give sufficient priority to the program, and its response can be described as nothing more than half-hearted. The auditors found that the department had not taken sufficient action to implement the package of measures announced by the government, despite the sense of urgent priority that the government had intended. It also appears that insufficient funds and staff have been provided to enable the department to develop a more appropriate program. The committee felt that the government failed to give adequate direction to the bureaucracy or to allocate sufficient funds or staff to the program.

          Consultants were also commissioned by the department to conduct an evaluation of the program. The consultants found that only two of the 25 major subprograms could be regarded as being highly effective. They also found that, at existing funding levels, the program would contribute only about 10 per cent of the required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and even then only if the program was made more effective.

          Fortunately, it appears that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is acting on the auditors' findings. The audit was an important catalyst for change, and the auditors believe that their presence contributed to the department acting more responsively towards the implementation of the program. The process of change initiated by the audit seems to have gained momentum with the report by the consultants.

          The national energy management plan is a part of the government's greenhouse response strategy and is obviously designed to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions. This program contains a diverse range of measures which are, at best, designed to bring about a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to only 10 per cent of our required target. Nonetheless, this program is central to the national greenhouse response strategy. It is important that Australia is not only seen to be taking positive steps in this area but is also achieving worthwhile results for our environment.

          The administration of the program was reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office and its effectiveness has also been assessed by independent consultants. Both assessments found that there were serious shortcomings in the program and its administration. In particular, the department was found to have failed to respond with the level of urgency suggested in the government's announcement of the program. This led to unacceptable delays in most elements of the program that were eventually developed. Those elements that were developed were found to be less than fully effective. As the chairman of the committee said, only two of the 25 measures implemented in the program were considered to be reasonably effective.

          The department has taken steps to remedy the situation, but the program remains grossly underresourced.

Certainly the commitment that was there when the program was announced has clearly faded.

          Funding reached $6.8 million in 1992-93 but has declined to $6.4 million in 1993-94. The budget announced earlier this month provides only $5.59 million for each of the next four years. When that amount is divided amongst 50 separate subprograms, clearly there is very little money available to achieve anything worth while. It seems as though this program was announced so that we could be seen to be doing something about greenhouse emissions to satisfy international observers and local conservationists.

At that time there were 4,000 people in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy but it is clear that the staff were allocated to other areas because the commitment in other areas was greater.

          I would like to say a lot about the subject of greenhouse emissions. There would be real benefits to the Australian economy and the environment in having effective programs in that regard. However, this report is about government management and the way in which a particular program was handled. The minister took little interest in the day-to-day affairs of this program even after there was an indication that little was being achieved. There was plenty of publicity but, seemingly, a lack of responsibility.

          It was all said by John Wicks, the First Assistant Secretary to the department, when giving evidence to the committee. He said that when there was only $1 million available the department took the view that the government was only half-hearted about it and it was not worth trying. That half-heartedness permeated the attitude of the department towards this program and, naturally, it has been less effective than was intended when the government made the announcement and this was certainly not the objective of the Australian people when supporting this kind of initiative.

          presented to the House this afternoon is in some ways an indication of the level of commitment the government and the bureaucracy have given to the reduction of greenhouse gases. This is a policy that this government will need to follow. As the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) pointed out, the report does point to some inadequacies in the administration of the program. I would like to correct a comment made by the honourable member for Wide Bay. He said that this is the second report that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has presented to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) this year. This report is a response to the implementation of the energy management program conducted by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the audit of that program conducted by the Australian National Audit Office.

          The audit office, I think quite correctly, was critical of the management of the program and the commitment that has been given thus far. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) pointed out, the consultants who also independently assessed some of the programs found that only two of them were completely followed through and implemented. A number of other programs or subprograms were only partly implemented.

          Without doubt, as the honourable member for Wide Bay indicated, if the government and the country at large are to respond in an effective manner to the likely greenhouse effect, there has to be a lot more commitment, and that commitment must come from both funding and a commitment within the bureaucracy to have that funding act effectively towards the targets that the government, in this case, will need to set.

          As to the overall effects of the greenhouse gas emissions, there is still considerable debate. However, most people recognise the need for us to adopt a no regrets policy on that. While a no regrets policy will not necessarily lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it certainly is the base from which we must start. The government must be prepared to put the money in to ensure that staffing levels which, as has been indicated in the report, are not present are there and that we give them the regulations to implement the targets and strategies which have to be implemented in terms of achieving our stated goals.

          It does appear that the stated goals, as we define them, are somewhat elusive in that sense. That is to be regretted because of the need for the implementation of these targets. Overall, as the honourable member for Fraser indicated in his remarks, there are benefits to be gained from pursuing this. The net benefit, if we measure it in an economic sense, can be portrayed as some $1.5 billion through achieving the targets. On the way through there will be some difficulty. Certainly, when we look at the estimates of the net greenhouse gas emissions for 1987-88, we find that some 63 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions are contributed through energy production and distribution, and the use of energy in Australia.

          To put in place targets or policies which will see that 63 per cent and the total amount produced come down will cause some problems. Even the honourable member for Wide Bay, while he is very rightly endorsing the thrust of this report the committee has presented to the House today, would no doubt be very concerned about the way some of the policies might be put in place to achieve those targets, particularly the types of industries which might be affected immediately. In implementing these targets, we also have to avoid the soft targets first up. We have to be prepared to think in terms of the long term, where we need to go and the sort of support that is put in place. Some of the legislation which I anticipate will come into the House this week or next week, such as the ethanol bounty fuel amendment bills, is part of that.

          had its genesis in the conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at which Australia, along with a number of other countries, agreed to pay some definite attention to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Australia signed that convention and agreed to adopt an interim planning target. The Australian people who were concerned about us entering into agreements such as this on an international level will be pleased to know that Australia did so with a caveat so that we could implement a program that was not detrimental to our nation's industries and our economic wellbeing.

          There is always a great need to bring about a balance in these matters. Certainly for some of us progress is not fast enough, but there has been a considerable move by governments and industry to address this problem. It is heartening that changes are taking place, but it was disappointing that the government—and perhaps the minister in this case—has not seen fit to follow up this program a little more vigorously. The Auditor-General's report was very critical of the way Australia has gone about adopting and implementing the recommendations in its planning. So we continue to be less than vigorous in the way we pursue the greenhouse gas emission problem.

We rank 15th on the list of world contributors and we have the third highest source of emissions on a per capita basis. It is estimated that, by the year 2005, over two-thirds of Australia's main greenhouse gas emissions will be due to the supply and use of energy. Our two largest users of energy are transport and manufacturing, which each account for just over one-third of Australia's total energy use. They are significant figures.

          That we need to participate with the rest of the world in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not in question. Improvements need not be costly or daunting to industry both from a competitive point of view and a profitability point of view. Industry can increase its profitability and its competitiveness, while simultaneously preserving our environment and cutting its energy costs and thus the emission of greenhouse gases.

          A significant contribution could be made to the competitiveness and profitability of industry with greater assurance from the national energy management program in achieving more efficient means of energy with a resulting low cost. The department has stated that it is underresourced and underfunded. I find it a little curious that this should be the case because the government has implemented an extra 2c tax on leaded fuel. Yet we are not really putting that tax back into solving this problem.

          The other problem is our road funding, which has been reduced again. The condition of our roads can increase our energy use and our output of harmful gases into the atmosphere. So there are two positive ways we could address this problem. The sum of $140 million in income will be raised from the additional 2c excise on lead that is now being implemented. We have put $100,000 of that money into looking at the problem of lead and emissions.

       I put this motion before the House because it is about time the Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy, commonly called CYPLUS, got the recognition and accolades that it deserves. CYPLUS is an outstanding example of cooperation between government and the community in relation to land use management. I am pleased to say that that cooperation is happening in my electorate of Leichhardt.

        When the Goss Labor government came to power in Queensland in December 1989, 137,000 square kilometres of the Cape York Peninsula were subject to many competing interests. There were plans for a space base on the peninsula; property developer George Quaid had just finalised the freehold purchase of the massive Starke property on the east coast; there were successful mining operations at Weipa and Cape Flattery; pastoralists held 54 per cent of land tenure; and four-wheel drive enthusiasts pushed their vehicles all over the peninsula's rough dirt roads. At the same time, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities were without basic infrastructure such as regular power, water and communications services, and some conservation groups were calling for the whole of the Cape York Peninsula to be nominated for World Heritage listing.

        Cape York Peninsula is a very remote area, larger than the state of Victoria. It is home to around 11,000 people, over 50 per cent of whom are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in communities of 200 people or more, most of which are located near the coast. Because of the peninsula's monsoonal tropical climate many of the roads are inaccessible for up to half of the year during the wet season, from November to April. Air and sea become the only reliable forms of transport at this time. Clearly, the Cape York Peninsula is one of the last great wilderness areas in the world, but it is under pressure from a range of often competing interests.

        Work on the CYPLUS is being carried out in three stages and public participation must be an important part of each stage. Stage one, which is nearing completion, is information collection. Through public participation, the information needed to decide which current and potential land users on the peninsula are ecologically sustainable is being collected. Stage two is policy making. Community groups will use the information from stage one and combine it with the social and cultural priorities needed to build the land use strategy which will be made up in a number of land use policies for the peninsula. Stage three is the implementation. Plans and policies will be reviewed in this stage and put into practice.

         As I said, stage one is nearing completion. The information collection has been organised by a task force of seven people.

        There was an understandable suspicion of the CYPLUS process when it was first established. Unfortunately, there is not a long history of genuine community consultation by government in Queensland, especially with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island groups and conservation groups.

Delays have affected all the community groups. I strongly urge everyone to get together and get the process moving. That is not to say that the CYPLUS has not made great achievements. As the member for Leichhardt, I have dealt with all the participating groups on a regular basis. Over the past year, I think it would be fair to say that all the feedback has been 90 per cent positive. There has just been some complaint about delays.

        As I said earlier, stage one of the process is information collection. An outstanding range of information has been collected and collated for input into the geographic information system, or the GIS, computer. There are two main information collecting programs—the natural resource and analysis program and the land use program. The natural resource analysis program is a scientific research program, collecting and mapping broad scale information on the natural resources of Cape York Peninsula—its geology, soils, ground water, vegetation and fauna.

All available scientific data on the peninsula is being collated and put into the GIS computer. When all the information is collated, the GIS will provide storage and a means of analysis of integrated information which can be used to build a land use strategy for the Cape York Peninsula.

        The fact of the matter is that actions in this place by the government of the honourable member and by his government in Brisbane have created a great Berlin wall—not of a social or political nature, such as the Berlin Wall, but one  of  an  economic  nature—stretching from Townsville all the way up to Bamaga and almost all the way down to Normanton. The Cape York Peninsula and part of the east coast down to Townsville is now surrounded by a giant Berlin wall.

        If we want to understand the significance of that, we should look at the Century mine, which has the biggest zinc deposits ever found in the world's history—I think that is a fair enough statement; I do not think I am overly representing the resource—that is to have a slurry pipeline to take its product from the mine site itself to a port.

        The length of the slurry pipeline will be—I cannot quote the exact figures—about 150, maybe 200, kilometres to the Gulf of Carpentaria. To get to that area it will need to go through a number of areas that are under some form of Aboriginal title. As a result of the media and the expectations placed on people there by the Queensland government, and because of attitudes that have developed unfortunately over a protracted period, they are fairly adamantly indisposed to allowing that pipeline to go anywhere near their land. Even the proposed surveying group that would look at alternative sites was not allowed on the Doomadgee Reserve at all. The net result is that the pipeline probably has to be diverted to Karumba. That is an extra 150 to 200 kilometres at an enormous cost of millions of dollars for every five or 10 kilometres of pipeline to the project.

        I tell the story to indicate the difficulties that are involved now in developing any of these resources because of the great Berlin wall which has been placed around North Queensland. The Century deposits have been held up—I venture to suggest that hold-up is very serious—for a protracted period. In times of normal zinc prices, the Century deposits are worth to this country $100,000 million a year. Similarly, the proposed development at Weipa would result, in times of normal aluminium prices, in nearly $1,000 million a year.

        Shelbourne Bay with its silicon sand deposits is an interesting case. If we want to know why our country is going broke, we need look no further than Shelbourne Bay. The last time I looked, which was a few years ago, we were exporting silicon from this country for $55 a tonne. However, when I was in the Queensland government, one year we imported back nine tonnes of silicon as optical fibre product into Australia and we paid $3.03 million a tonne for it. It was 99.98 per cent silicon, almost pure, when it went out and it was pure silicon when it came back in. If we want to be technical, we are exporting the same number of molecules of silicon out of the country as we are importing into the country; they have just been rearranged. But the rearrangement has been worth over $3 million a tonne to the Japanese economy.

        At the present moment we are producing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of silicon and exporting it from Cape Flattery, which is north of Cooktown. But, when an Australian developer attempts to develop the resource at Shelbourne Bay, he is told he has environmental problems; he has Aboriginal problems; he has Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority problems; and he has Beach Protection Management Authority problems. In fact, he has so many problems that we can forget about the resource completely.

        But that resource in the two-inch thick, very heavily documented proposals I saw, which were the mining proposals for that area of Shelbourne Bay—the Australian owned lease, I emphasise, at Shelbourne Bay—was to produce 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes of high-tech silicon at about $20,000 per tonne per year. Even though I think some of those figures can be a little optimistic, there is no doubt that we are talking here about a facility that will be worth $2,000 million a year to the Australian economy. So the giant Berlin wall that has gone up around Cape York Peninsular has resulted in the stopping of the Century development, the Weipa development and the Shelbourne Bay development, each of those projects being worth $4,000 million a year to the Australian economy.

It is blowing into the ocean. We have the navigation charts which designate that dune as being a certain height at the turn of the century; it is now only half that height. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to work it out. The leading end of the dune is now protruding about 50 or 100 metres into the Pacific Ocean and dissipating on the ocean floor from which it cannot be recovered. There is no issue here. Within 70 years there will be no dune at all; the whole dune will be gone. This nation will have forgone an income of $2,000 million.

        As well as that, Australia could project itself by producing high quality silicon. We could produce it far more cheaply than any other country. Because our original resource is 99 per cent pure silicon, instead of having to go through five processes, we would only need to go through three processes. Then, because we are able to do that, we will be able to produce a silicon product.

        For those who are very environmentally conscious, let me state that this nation would automatically become the world leader in solar energy because we could produce photovoltaic cells at about half their present cost. We would cut the cost of the entire input item, which of course is silicon, clean in half. Solar energy, at this point, through photovoltaics, is competitive at peak hours in the middle of the day but far from being competitive overall with coal fired power stations. However, most certainly, at peak hours we could achieve a similar pricing structure to that provided by the coal industry at present.

         We are forgoing all of these wonderful advantages for our nation for no purpose except a blind adherence by the media and people in this House who are continuously intimidated by references to the greenies or people of Aboriginal descent. I say in defence of the black people on Cape York Peninsula that every time a development has gone ahead, it has been at their expense. The mining companies have not made the effort to try to provide something for the locals. Heaven only knows, when Charters Towers was given a choice of having a uranium mine there or not having one there, when we were told we got the pollution but Townsville got the jobs, needless to say, that community rose as one and completely defeated the project.

I told them to market themselves aggressively and negotiate aggressively. At the end of the day, I ask this House to please understand that we are dealing with intelligent people who have their own concerns. If there is something in it for them, I can assure the House that the majority of them will be in favour of the project, but if there is absolutely nothing in it for them, they cannot be convinced and, naturally, they will object to it. Those are the things that we should be addressing.

Yes, they are having to deal with certain issues that the Aboriginal communities have raised and they are having to deal with environmental issues, but that is the purpose of this Cape York land use study. The whole purpose of the study was to bring all interested parties together, to study all the issues involved and to make sure that every interest group involved on Cape York has their views known and taken into account. Current and future needs on the Cape York Peninsula can be properly planned to take account of all the different interest groups and all the different factors, such as protection of our environment, protection of Aboriginal sacred sites and their other interests, the protection of pastoral interests and the protection of ordinary residential interests in the Cape York Peninsula.

I remind everyone that we are talking about an area of land about the size of Victoria which, as the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) has pointed out, has a population of around 11,000 people. It is a very large area of land with a relatively small population. One of the primary objectives of the Cape York Peninsula land use study must be to find out the values, needs and aspirations of those residents and also to ensure the sensible, long-term sustainable use of Cape York land.

        In the short time I have available, I want to talk about one particular group in this region: the cattle producers, the pastoralists. Having met some of them, my concern is that they are being very much overlooked in this whole study. I noticed that the honourable member for Leichhardt mentioned the delays that have been going on. I would suggest that these delays are part of the very significant problems. It is creating uncertainty. It is obviously making it very difficult for people to see where their future is.

        We are talking about around 100 families—a very small but, nonetheless, significant number. More importantly, this group has the potential and opportunity to make a very significant contribution to our economy. My concern is that the cattle producers' views are being very much overshadowed by other groups, such as the environmentalists' views and some of the Aboriginal interests. I think it is vital that in this study the economic, cultural and ecological interests are balanced and not tilted very heavily one way.

        Clearly, there are areas of environmental sensitivity. Obviously, there are areas of strong cultural significance for Aboriginal communities. But, very clearly, there are also significant areas in this very large area of land of great potential for agricultural development. It was estimated in 1989 that the turn-off by these 100 cattle producers was around 16,000 head of cattle. That is far below the levels that used to be maintained in the past. Unfortunately, that trend of decline has been continuing. But now technology is available that could not only reverse this declining trend but also make massive increases in the productivity and the level of production.

        Technological improvements that would be able to cope with the physical constraints and the difficulties of high rainfall that sometimes, while reliable, is highly seasonal could be of major significance. As I said, the turn-off was around 16,000; it could be increased to a quarter of a million head of cattle per year which would produce a gross income of $80 million—a tenfold increase on the current position. The technology is there and the opportunities are there but, because of this uncertainty and delay, the surface is not even  being scratched.

        At least 80 per cent of the land used by pastoralists would be left in its natural state, and 20 per cent of it would see some pastoral improvements in this regard. Obviously massive gains could be made through technology. We would have to have proper access to roads and to finance. Obviously there would have to be some changes in government policies to allow this development. But I think it is very important for this group to be given proper credit for the work it is doing.

       It would be naive to imagine, in the present state of world tension, that a declaration of the illegality of the use of nuclear weapons, even if made by such an authoritative body as the World Court, would lead the nuclear nations to eliminate them from their strategy, still less to agree at once to abandon them. It would, however, mark an important step forward in awakening the peoples and governments of the world to the extent to which modern military weapons have outrun all the basic concepts of the international law of war, as well as all morality and humanity.

       Anyone knowing the history of nuclear weapons will realise why this motion has been moved today. While many people remember the 1980s as being swept with greed, it was also a time which saw an explosion in the number of nuclear weapons possessed by countries around the globe. In 1945 there were two nuclear bombs in existence; 41 years later in 1986 there were nearly 70,000 nuclear weapons in active operational forces. That is an enormous amount of destructive force in anyone's language.

        Currently there are nearly 50,000 active nuclear weapons in the world. In conventional terms this represents 2.2 tonnes of TNT for every person on the planet. There has been a healthy reduction of 20,000 missiles over the last eight years. However, there are still far too many. These 50,000 missiles have a total explosive fire power equal to 900,000 Hiroshima bombs. The Hiroshima bomb, dropped in the last days of the Second World War, killed an estimated 140,000 people. If one nuclear bomb killed that many, how many would 50,000 missiles kill? We now know that modern bombs are 75 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima.

        In 1993 the World Health Assembly, which is the governing body of the World Health Organisation, referred to the World Court the question of whether the use of nuclear weapons was contrary to international law. In November 1993 a motion was tabled to seek a somewhat wider ruling on whether use or the threat of use was illegal. This was eventually withdrawn following heavy pressure from the United States, the United Kingdom and France. However, the case put forward by the World Health Organisation is now proceeding.

        The government is suspicious that the World Court may actually find that the use of nuclear weapons may be acceptable in some circumstances, such as in retaliation to a first strike or in response to a massive conventional attack. My concern is that this line of thought belongs to the era of the Cold War. We have moved on from the Cold War and we need to change our policy to reflect that. Nuclear deterrents should not rely on the grotesque premise of stable deterrents but on collective security through an assertive security council involving the cooperation of all nuclear powers. It is unlikely that the court would legitimise the use of nuclear weapons but, even if it did, the principles of international law as they exist in the 1990s would have to be articulated for public consumption and understanding.

We should be capable of taking a principled and moral decision on the legality of nuclear weapons and articulate it before the rest of the world. The aim of this motion today is to rid the planet of a menace that has the potential to destroy us all. Can anyone legitimately stand in the way of this aim?

        —No-one can doubt the obvious sincerity of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in wanting to achieve a safer world—if not for ourselves, certainly for our children. Regrettably, the coalition cannot support the motion in its present form for good reason. The reason is that the quest to ban nuclear weapons would be adhered to if it were enforced—if it were law—by the very countries striving to prevent irresponsible countries from using nuclear weapons to gain ascendancy over other innocent people.

        The coalition strongly supports any move to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That can and is being done through treaties, such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty. But the coalition cannot support moves to declare nuclear weapons illegal because, terrifying and repugnant as those weapons are, nuclear deterrents do work and have worked.

        Thankfully, nuclear weapons have not been used in a war since 1945. That is because nuclear weapons held by countries such as the US, the former USSR, the United Kingdom, France and China possess a strategic nuclear capability sufficiently credible to deter an exchange of nuclear weapons. That is a matter of history as well as a matter of fact.

        The present government, of which the honourable member for Moreton is a significant member, does not agree with the honourable member's point of view on this particular matter. Successive Australian governments of all political colours have agreed to host military facilities which play a significant role in the strategic nuclear capability of the United States. If we were in government—we will be after the next election—we would continue to do so because the possession by the United States of a credible strategic nuclear capability is a key factor in preventing global nuclear wars. The coalition does not believe that our quest for peace in the world and the efforts of organisations such as the United Nations should be made illegal.

We do not believe, however, that having the World Court declare these weapons illegal will in fact make them disappear. The leadership shown by the United States in the last few years in achieving agreements for disarmament and for the destruction of nuclear weapons by that nation and by others is having a significant effect on the quest by all of us to achieve a safe world and to rid ourselves finally of nuclear weapons.

        The end of the Cold War has dramatically reduced the threat of global nuclear war—and I think my friend the honourable member for Moreton concedes that point. As a result, the United States and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. In particular, they have withdrawn inherently destabilising nuclear weapons such as warheads on short range ballistic missiles and seaborne cruise missiles. With the threat of global nuclear war diminished—but not, it must be stressed, eliminated entirely—it is the proliferation of nuclear weapons that now poses the greatest nuclear threat to regional peace and hostility. I think my friends would agree with that statement.

Why would this parliament wish to inflict on those friends of ours further danger from the threats that come from North Korea today by forcing allies to rid themselves of nuclear weapons that are kept only as a deterrent? I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton would not suggest that the United States of America, our ally, holds its remaining nuclear weapons as a threat against the world. I am sure that it is common ground on both sides that they hold the remaining weapons as deterrents against the aggressive use of nuclear weapons against the free world.

        We support the indefinite extension of the nuclear proliferation treaty. Honourable members might be interested in taking note of that. The treaty comes up for review in 1995—a short time away. We support accelerated work on a comprehensive test ban treaty. We support the missile technological control regime. And we support very strongly the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Building international support for these international treaties and organisations and ensuring compliance with them is our best hope for containing nuclear proliferation.

        It may be tempting to think that the decline in the rivalry between the West and the East has meant that the risk of nuclear conflict has disappeared. Nothing could be further from the truth. With the end of the Cold War, new concerns and worries have replaced old, not least in relation to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons. We may no longer have to worry greatly about the risk of a nuclear first strike from the Eastern bloc. However, today we must be concerned about the increased possibility of low level nuclear threats and nuclear proliferation.

        The world cannot discount the possibility of accidental or unauthorised limited nuclear strikes. No amount of well-intentioned legal argument at any forum will be enough to prevent a holocaust. In relation to the former USSR, there are several scenarios in which an accidental launch of nuclear weapons may occur. Poorly maintained weapons or faulty command and communication structures could be a source of risk for accidental launch. Other possibilities include the provision of incorrect or misinterpreted information to the nuclear command. We must also consider the danger of unauthorised nuclear strikes. Examples include the maverick general who has command of nuclear weapons, the mad submarine captain or the terrorist.

        Concern has been expressed about the possibility of rogue elements in the former USSR, including Mafia style criminal organisations, conducting nuclear terrorism. These scenarios have long been subject matter for popular fiction, but these nightmares could well become a reality. The President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, obviously shares this concern. At a recent conference of the successor organisation to the KGB, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, President Yeltsin urged the service to be vigilant about the threat of nuclear terrorism. The director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, believes that the interest of Russian organised crime in selling nuclear weapons or materials stolen from the former Soviet republics is the greatest long-term threat to the security of the United States.

        An example of the potential danger is the present tension between Ukraine and Russia, both nuclear armed states, over Crimea. Associated Press recently reported that the Russian defence minister, Pavel Grachev, has warned that a military conflict in Ukraine could spark a civil war engulfing the rest of Ukraine. Of course, the former USSR is not the only source of nuclear risk. For some time there has been a concern about nuclear armed Third World nations. Proliferation of nuclear armed Third World states has the potential to increase the risk of accidental or unauthorised strikes. Proliferation also increases the chances of possible panic situations and may mean that future conflicts could result in nuclear blackmail. North Korea and its possible nuclear arms building plans may one day prove a case in point.

        There are those, like Ms Jennie George of the ACTU executive, who wish to believe that `the family is a relic of the past'. Such people say that only 15 per cent of the population live in the traditional or normal family—a statistic based on families made up of married couples with two children. It does not include couples without children; couples with one child; couples with three, four or more children; couples with grown-up families; brothers and sisters sharing a home together; couples with children who share a home with grandparents; or sole parent families.

        In fact, contrary to the protestations of Ms George and her ilk, 85 per cent of people in this country actually live in a family situation. The picket fence is still the norm, not the bizarre exception. However, what is happening behind the picket fence is a different matter and in many instances a great cause for concern. Marriage breakdown, spiralling divorce rates, the apparent escalation of domestic violence and child abuse, and the increasing number of street kids are some illustrations of society's malaise vividly portrayed in the news media on a daily basis.

        To be more specific, according to the Salvation Army report of 1993, 40,000 families are expected to become homeless by the end of 1994. There are 800,000 children living in homes where neither parent is employed. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the divorce rate is now close to 40 per cent of the annual marriage rate. Over 5,000 children aged between five and 17 years were sexually abused in 1993. Almost 5,500 in that age group were physically abused in that same year. This is probably a very conservative estimate, because we are dealing only with reported cases.

        Despite the fact that a number of surveys have shown strong support for family values—such as the South Australian survey conducted by McGregor Marketing in May 1993 which showed that 78 per cent of the people in that state support a return to traditional family values—families are increasingly under threat.

       The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, warned on 14 April of the effects of `an even greater abuse of children brought on by the pressures resulting in the breakdown of the family unit'. He said that Australia had `totally failed' many of its young people. He found that de facto arrangements where the father was not the natural parent had resulted in the occurrence of sexual abuse of children rising by 600 per cent. He believed that the steep rise of single parent families in Australia to between 400,000 and 500,000 was leading to children being unable to cope, committing suicide and having other associated problems. Mr Burdekin went further to describe as `a disgrace' the fact that every young male prostitute on The Wall in Darlinghurst was a ward of the state.

The average night's television entertainment often comprises far more the bizarre, the seamy, the ugly and the violent than the wholesome.

I, therefore, call on all political parties in this House to promote policies which, in accordance with the wording of this motion, weld the family together and sustain it through adverse circumstances; in the taxation area positively discriminate in favour of the family; and, in the operation of the Family Law Act, emphasise reconciliation where possible.

        —This motion is a good indicator of the confusion facing the Liberal Party in the 1990s. It is trying to work out whether it is a conservative party or a liberal party in the classical sense. From this motion the judgment to be made is that it is a very conservative party, even reactionary. Implicit in the motion is the assumption that a traditional nuclear family is the only family around which government should make policy. The Liberal Party in the 1990s believes in only two families—the nuclear family and the royal family. That is a great problem it has in its policy making. For people who are not married, who have a wife that works, who have not got dependent children, who are engaged in a homosexual relationship or who are part of an extended family, they take no part in Liberal Party thought or policy. No party can appeal to a broad range of Australians in the 1990s when it focuses on a minority of Australians.

        As the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) confirmed, this is a motion with a white picket fence. This motion confirms how inadequate the Liberal Party has become in terms of understanding social change and understanding the proper role of government. Government responds to the choices that individuals make, it backs those choices in and supports them with effective government policy and programs. There is no role in our society for a government to impose on people its image of good family life. That is exactly what this conservative party tries to do. This is an exercise in social engineering. It takes what it regards as a good model of a family and says that every Australian family should fit the model and if it does not something is wrong.

        The figures quoted by the honourable member for Deakin are virtually meaningless because the root cause of any problem in our society is social disadvantage. If we take any disadvantaged community the figures for marriage breakdown will be higher, as they will for many other social problems. The Liberal Party has no understanding of cause and effect. This motion shows that it has no understanding of the way in which social problems arise and the way in which they can be corrected. Further, the motion does not recognise the immense diversity of Australian society and family types in the 1990s. We cannot talk about family values in a meaningful way unless we recognise diversity.

        The term `family values', which is a throwaway line in politics, has become an empty piece of rhetoric. What does it stand for? The only thing it can stand for is to recognise that family types, structures and individual choices are so diverse that we cannot pinpoint one set of values for all people in society and act as the basis of government policy. This motion shows conclusively that we cannot go back to the future. We cannot go back to an Australia where the majority of families consisted of the nuclear family structure—the male working, the wife at home, dependent children, the picture of the Queen on the wall, and children singing `God save the Queen' every morning. Those opposite cannot go back to that because Australia has gone way past that. Australia has moved past, while the Liberal Party and its thinking have stayed rooted in the 1950s and 1960s.

        There is no set formula for families. One need only look at the figures to understand how families have changed and evolved through the years. There are three main sources of change. There are fewer people married and staying married than ever before. In 1975, for instance, 15 per cent of marriages were preceded by a couple living together. In 1993 that figure was 60 per cent—by choice, by individuals making a choice about the lifestyle that best suits their needs and preferences.

        One-parent families in 1982 comprised 7.75 per cent of all family types. That figure in 1992 was nine per cent. The important thing to understand is that one cannot stereotype the one-parent family as being a teenage mum, because teenage mothers comprise only three per cent of one-parent families in Australia. Eighty per cent of one-parent families are people in the age group 25 to 49 who have made a choice to divorce or to break their de facto relationship. It is their choice to make; it is not for people in parliament to lecture them about their free individual choices.

        Births outside marriages have increased from 13.7 per cent in 1982 to 24 per cent in 1993. The honourable member for Deakin refers in his motion and his speech to the divorce rate. He should be congratulating this government if he really believes in what he is saying because divorce in Australia per 1,000 married population has come down from 12.5 per cent in 1982 to 11.5 per cent in 1993. The divorce rate under this government is down. So if he believes his rhetoric about family values and the importance of the traditional nuclear family, the motion should congratulate the government for the fall in the divorce rate. In truth, the government can take no credit because it is not the role of government to say to people, `You shall divorce' or `You shall not divorce without reconciliation', as implied in the motion. It is not the role of government to make those decisions. Individuals should make those decisions. They are not to be stood over by social engineers.

        The other change is that more women are working. The labour force participation rate for women has increased from 41 per cent in 1973 to 51 per cent in 1993. Government policy should be framed around that movement, around the preference of women in the 1990s to find work according to their own choice and personal preference. As a proportion of all couples in Australia, the number of partnerships where both partners work has increased from 42 per cent in 1982 to 53 per cent in 1993.

        One has to recognise also the growing diversity of Australian society. The Liberal Party is never comfortable with migrants or multiculturalism. The reality, however, is it is more likely for a multicultural community to produce extended families, particularly with some of the southern European and Asian migrants coming to Australia. One also needs to recognise the diversity of Aboriginal family structures and homosexual couples. We know what the Liberal Party thinks about homosexual couples in Tasmanian law. It thinks that states rights are much more important than human rights. When one listens to the honourable member for Deakin one can understand why.

That is, not even a third of the people in my electorate fit the criteria and outline set by the honourable member for Deakin in his speech and motion. That is why the motion is flawed. Setting policy around such a small part of our society is inevitably flawed. Government must support the lifestyle choices of individuals.

The number of child-care places has increased in support of working parents from 46,000 in 1983 to 237,000 in 1994. That is an increase of 400 per cent, backing in the choices of women to break the models set by the honourable member for Deakin—a model rooted in the 1950s—and to take their rightful place in the work force.

If people have made a free, adult choice to divorce, should government come in and say, `No, go back to the drawing board.

Any organisation—a church, a trade union or a political party—that tries to defy social trends and remodel society in its own image will fail, and it will crumble.

It is quite ironic that this debate has been brought on by the opposition in the debate on private members business. It is the first time this year that the International Year of the Family has been mentioned in this chamber and the first time there has been any debate on the subject at all. All the raving by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) about what his government is doing about this matter is such that the government is not so proud of it to even bring on a debate, make a ministerial statement or even raise a question in this chamber.

        What we hear from the honourable member for Werriwa is the continuation of the great lie about families in Australia and it indicates the problem of talking about families. The honourable member for Werriwa constructs a straw man which he can then strike down by saying that only 15 per cent of families constitute whatever his traditional family is. That depends on the parameters he sets for the traditional family. If he wants to set parameters which say that only one parent can be working and that a family has X number of children, they are the parameters he is setting. The reality in this country is that 86 per cent of all families are couple families. If we look at the practice and the aspirations of ordinary Australians, despite all the doom and gloom we have had from sociologists and experts in the past two decades, we see that they are practising normal, conventional family life. Most of them are proud of it and most of them aspire to it. Even when they fail, they aspire to it again, which can be seen in the large number of people who remarry following divorce.

        The statistics quoted by the honourable member do not make sense either. It is certainly the case that more couples live together before going into marriage, but the great majority of them then marry. The honourable member talks about 25 per cent of children being born out of wedlock as if that is something about which we ought to be proud. The United States, where the figure is now 24 per cent, has had three congressional inquiries over the last three or four years to deal with what Republican and Democrat alike have identified as being the major social problem facing that nation. Yet we have this nonsense from the honourable member for Werriwa, who says, `It is okay, we do not have to worry about it.' The honourable member quotes the divorce rate as falling from 12 to 11 per thousand. Where did it start about a decade and a half ago? It was four per thousand. The honourable member can quote statistics saying that we have a great fall from 12 to 11 per thousand. That is a threefold increase over the last decade and a half, so it is hardly anything to be proud of.

A decade ago the top one per cent of earners in Australia earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent; whereas now the top one per cent earn as much as the bottom 21 per cent—a doubling in that group made up of the poor.

        Statistics prepared by Anne Harding at the university here in Canberra indicate that families with children constitute the poorest group in Australian society. One can go on and on and on with the statistics. The reality is that, under the government of those opposite, ordinary Australian families became worse off in the 1980s.

        Society and its values are quite different from those that existed just after the Second World War. Technology, transport and education have changed. Even the definition of a family has changed. Families are even broader now. At a time of immense growth after the war many young couples could afford to make a home for themselves rather than live with parents, and the definition of a family was seen then as a male, a female and two children. The male was the breadwinner and the female the homemaker.

        Not surprisingly really, many men came home from the war to find work and displaced many of the women who had carried out those tasks while they were away. The range of employment was more limited than it is now. The male would have done his apprenticeship or have started with an employer when he was 15 or 16 and then continued with that employer all his working life. There were opportunities to start at the bottom of a company and work one's way up. Public transport was the main transport for most working people and the motor car was used for recreational purposes. Education was geared for a range of jobs that were available for the young coming out of school or for entry into apprenticeship schemes.

        How different it is today. The male is no longer seen as the breadwinner. Both partners often contribute equally and there is an expectation that each shares equally in family responsibilities. Work has changed. The hours are shorter, the pay greater, but the security is less. Contract workers no longer have the ability to control how long they stay working for one person. It is often left up to the demand and the success of a business. The age of certainty is finished. There are no tariff barriers and we have market driven wage increases. Remember when wages were set on the needs of a family by arbitration? The other side of the House cannot argue for market economics and deregulation on one hand and then say these matters do not affect family life or change society.

        Young people need more training. Companies no longer want someone to start at the bottom and work up. They want workers who slot into specialised areas that require off-the-job training. With education comes information. People are not prepared to accept work and home conditions that they have put up with before. They know things can be better.

        Australian social trends in 1994, compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveal that between 1982 and 1992 the number of single men getting married fell from 55 per cent per thousand to 41 per cent per thousand. People still want to share their lives with a partner, whether they are married or not. The number of de facto couples increased by just under 50 per cent between 1986 and 1991. This study exposes the myth, the belief, that teenage mothers are the prime source of children born outside marriage. Births from mothers aged under 20 fell from 7.2 per cent in 1982 to 5.4 per cent in 1992.

        The idea of marriage has changed, too, along with the concept of the family. Families can be defined as those in a household. There may be no blood relatives or it may mean a mother, grandmother and child. It may mean a father and son or it could mean two single parents getting together to share costs. A family means that there is someone who cares for you when you need help, to share joy and sorrow and assist you to survive in an ever increasingly changing world. People are more mobile; they travel more and experience other cultures. Australia is fortunate to have people from different cultures arriving in this country all the time and has benefited greatly from them.

Without strong family units there can be no community—without community there is no nation.

         Governments cannot, nor should they, attempt to take the place of the family. Families tell government what they need. Government does not tell families what is good for them. You cannot build a house from the roof down—it must be built from the foundation up. The society, made up of family units, is supreme. It dictates the form of government, the role of government, and determines the limits of its power.

This follows many years of uncertainty in the timber industry, which has culminated in the state and federal governments agreeing on coming together with a plan for the south-east forests of New South Wales and, I believe shortly, the eastern forests of Victoria. This agreement is extremely important because I believe that it covers important environmental concerns as well as the needs of a viable timber industry, an industry which is based on a sawmill industry but which has, as an adjunct, the woodchip industry.

         —In the last session I drew the attention of this chamber to a kit that has been circulated amongst secondary schools entitled `Paying tax'. This kit is designed to encourage secondary students to learn all about paying tax before they have learned about earning a living. The other half of this story is that the federal government is now trying to turn teachers at these secondary schools into bounty hunters. The federal government is offering $3 a head to every teacher who can sign up a student to take on a tax file number. That is right—$3 for each scalp. It sounds incredible—$3 to sign up taxpayers!

         At the same time, the government never remembers that it ought to be paying some compensation to the poor businesses that have to keep collecting tax. The fact is that taxes are so complicated. For example, it costs more to administer the fringe benefits tax in some sections than the amount of money that is actually collected. Of course, there is no compensation to business.

         These priorities just highlight what an extraordinary approach the Labor Party has to the whole question of tax. Kits are going into schools telling people how to pay tax. Teachers are being turned into bounty hunters by being offered $3 a head. Yet where does the government talk about how people actually earn a living? The first thing we have to do in life is earn a living before we can pay tax. But the priorities of this government seem to be the other way round—people have to pay tax, they have to have tax file numbers, and if they happen to earn a living that is just incidental.

         The other point he made was that most social problems can be traced very much to social disadvantage. The Liberal Party will never understand that. Even though the Liberal Party now has its own political family in order, with the very wealthiest born to rule families at the top of the tree, as we saw last week, it cannot be regarded—even more so now—as a legitimate party to run this country because it does not understand social disadvantage.

In the case of the Liberal Party, it is what it does not stand for, because it does not seem to stand for very much at all at the moment, apart from continued wealth, privilege and elitism.

All Victorian public hospitals have suffered, but some have been more seriously affected than others. Medical, nursing, paramedical, administrative and other staff are being pressed to work harder for less payments. Staff numbers have been reduced often with little regard for the persons involved, some of whom have given years of dedicated service. This has further eroded the morale of the remaining staff. Presently, the managers of Victorian public hospitals are at their wits' end trying to figure out how to cope with the next round of budget cuts.

The state government in Victoria has recently cancelled a wind farm, with wind generators, at Lakes Entrance. The reason it gave for doing this was the high cost of maintenance. All it has to do is look at Esperance, Western Australia, where these wind turbines have been going for many years, to see that these generators have saved many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

         As a result of the current laws governing ownership and the operation of pharmacies, the pharmacy is operated on site by the previous chief pharmacist. It is operating effectively and is providing an excellent service to patients. Previous medical records for patients who have visited the hospital in the last four years are kept on site with other records archived for easy access.

         The cooperation between the RSL, the Hollywood Hospital and the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is welcomed. I would like to give them every possible support and encouragement. It is clear that the new operations of Hollywood Hospital are paving the way for improved and effective care of Australia's veteran community.

         —A federally funded body is telling Queensland students that they can do as they like and that teachers have no right to discipline them. A know-your-rights kit is about to be distributed to school children by the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, a body set up to promote the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and bankrolled by the Australian taxpayer through the Australian Youth Foundation.

         While the rights of parents and teachers are overlooked, the kit details the legal rights of students in schools. Nothing is said about their responsibilities to society or to fellow members of the school community. Students are advised that teachers have no right to search students or their school bags even in pursuit of drugs and if they do so, a criminal assault is committed. Even lockers are immune from search.

         The state education minister is understandably concerned about the distribution of the kit. Sure there is nothing wrong with students and all people knowing their rights, but they should also be made aware of their responsibilities. This misguided project is a gross misuse of taxpayers' money and must be stopped immediately in the interests of students, teachers and society.

Back in 1983 it was Peter who got me elected because of his being hot on the issue of no dams, 24 hours a day. Then in 1993 he also got me elected, on the GST, and now he is doing it once again with the change of leadership. So, Peter, on behalf of myself and I am certain other people, I thank you very much.

         That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 18 May 1994, of Sir John Oscar Cramer, Minister for the Army from 1956 to 1963 and Member of the House of Representatives for Bennelong from 1949 to 1974, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

        John Oscar Cramer was born on 18 February 1896 at Gaspard, Quirindi in New South Wales. One of six children, he was educated at the local Gaspard Public School. After leaving school at the age of 14, Sir John worked on the family farm and then managed a small family owned fruit shop in Quirindi.

         In 1917 Sir John moved to Sydney, where he was offered work with Paramount Pictures Film Exchange. In 1920 Sir John and his brothers, Charles and Roy, set up a small real estate business on the North Shore in Sydney. Those who knew him knew that he retained his interests in this business well into his retirement. Prior to entering federal politics, Sir John was actively involved in local government, holding significant positions including Chairman of the Sydney County Council and Mayor of North Sydney.

         Sir John is recognised as one of the co-founders of the Liberal Party.

From 1 March 1950, Sir John served as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works and chaired the committee from 1954 to 1955. He also served as a member on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1970 to 1972. He led an Australian delegation to the 14th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in the Bahamas in 1968 and was an observer at the South Pacific Conference in Fiji in 1970.

         Few members in the House are contemporaries of Sir John Cramer. I happen to be one of them. I got to know him quite well. We used to share parliamentary offices in Sydney. In those days, we used to all go to the Commonwealth Bank cafeteria for our meals. He would hold court most days and give stories of federal politics and personalities. For anyone who has not been here, things were different before 1975. They changed in atmosphere substantially after that time. Before then, there was a substantial degree of fraternisation amongst members. None have brought me more pleasure than the conversations I had with Sir John Cramer. He was a very decent individual and a very nice man. Everyone who knew him liked him. On behalf of the government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in its bereavement.

         Today I want to focus on what the passing of Sir John Cramer means to my party, the Liberal Party, and why his life and work are so inseparable from our party, whose founding owes so much to him. John Cramer and his family were an example of what hard work and dedication to duty could achieve in a land of opportunity. They were part of a true pioneering spirit of old Australia which built the strong foundations on which so much has subsequently been achieved. John Cramer's record of service to the Liberal Party is a record of how the party began, how it attracted people of drive and talent, how its appeal grew and how it became the dominant political force in postwar Australia.

         John Cramer's career was living testimony to the Liberal commitment to duty, family, individual worth, initiative, freedom and social obligation—all values which were a driving force in Sir John Cramer's life.

         John Cramer was a person who placed a high importance on public duty. He was a person who had achieved personal success through his own hard work, who overcame many difficulties and who had a great love for his country. He was a person who believed that Australia's success had been built on private enterprise and individual freedom and who wanted to ensure that those principles were always advanced. He was a person who totally rejected the notion of socialism in Australia, which the Labor Party at the time strongly advocated and which he saw as a fundamental threat to Australian democracy.

         John Cramer was also a person with a very clear view about the social and moral values which he saw as fundamental to Australia's past successes and essential if Australia was to realise its full potential in an economic as well as a social sense. For him, an unshakeable commitment to family life, loyalty to principles and a strong moral code were the foundations of a strong and secure Australia. John Cramer and so many of his generation were inspired by these beliefs and values. As such, they were drawn to the liberal-conservative tradition of Australian politics.

         John Cramer was a man who was never content with stereotyping. He was a man whose achievements in life reflected his own family background and his own drive to succeed. His grandfather came to Australia from Germany and, with very little to support him, toiled hard in rural New South Wales to build a better life for his family. In his memoirs, John Cramer describes his own childhood on his father's farm near Quirindi as very poor in terms of money but rich in terms of happiness and family life.

         John Cramer and his family were also strongly and proudly Catholic at a sectarian time in our history when being so had its costs. It was from this background that John Cramer came to Sydney in 1916 with #4 in his pocket and hope in his heart. He decided, with his brothers, to establish—from scratch—a real estate business in the northern suburbs of Sydney. In doing so, he experienced all the highs and lows of struggling to establish a small business. His courage, determination, integrity and business acumen guaranteed the success of his venture.

         To a record of growing business successes in the real estate and building industries, John Cramer added an expanding involvement in political and community life. In the 1930s and 1940s he became the Mayor of North Sydney and, later, Chairman of the Sydney County Council. In both offices he achieved great advances in community service and great support and recognition for the role of Australia's service personnel.

         John Cramer had a long and active involvement in the United Australia Party in the 1930s. He became one of the very early advocates of the need for a nationwide party in the liberal conservative tradition to replace the UAP. He became convinced that such a vision would only be realised if UAP figures in New South Wales took the initiative. On most Thursdays throughout 1943, John Cramer gathered with those who shared his vision in the Blue Room Cafe in Rowe Street, Sydney, to discuss how a new national party to oppose Labor could be formed.

         Withstanding the pressure from UAP diehards in other parts of Australia and the manoeuvring from other groups, such as the Commonwealth Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, John Cramer and his colleagues worked tirelessly to convince the New South Wales branch of the UAP of the need to change, and ultimately succeeded. That success led to the founding of the Democratic Party at the 1944 state election in New South Wales and ensured that subsequently a genuine nationwide party in the liberal conservative tradition was both necessary and inevitable. It was Robert Menzies who galvanised this new political mood, who brilliantly outmanoeuvred Labor in the late 1940s, and who proved a leader of unmatched skill and durability in Australia's political history.

         In terms of creating the momentum for the founding of the Liberal Party, it was a small group of visionaries in New South Wales who were of critical importance and the work of John Cramer within that group was absolutely vital. John Cramer became an early member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he won the seat of Bennelong when the Menzies government was swept to office in the famous 1949 election and he held that seat continuously until he retired in 1974 at the age of 78. He served as the Minister for the Army from 1956 until 1963 and helped to forge a wide range of regional defence associations which have been built on in the decade since.

His personal qualities and values, as well as his own achievements and commitments to the wider community, epitomise what our party stands for. At a difficult time in the history of Liberal and conservative politics in this country, it was John Cramer who had a bold vision of what we needed and the courage and determination to help ensure that vision was realised. He was a man who knew and overcame much prejudice in his life. He treated others on the very Christian basis of what they believed and how they acted—not what school they went to, what formal education they had or what religion they belonged to. He expected others to treat him the same, and his success in business, community and political life was on that basis.

John Cramer belonged to a generation that saw a special honour in public duty and community service, and his achievements in both will benefit Australians for generations to come. With his passing, the Liberal Party has lost one of its founding stalwarts and the Australian community has lost a man who did so much to improve it. I commend this motion to the House.

         —It is a privilege to rise in support of this motion of condolence for the late Sir John Cramer. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in that regard. As the Prime Minister pointed out, Sir John Cramer was born last century on a farm in the Quirindi district. His life spanned some 98 years of remarkable change. The Australia of 1994 is a very different place from the Australia of 1896. For example, in place of the once a week mail delivery in Quirindi, we now have faxes, mobile phones, radio, television and a twice a week mail delivery.

         There are some things that will never change and, in particular, certain aspects of Sir John's farm upbringing will endure forever. In his autobiography entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Pioneers, Politics and People
         </emphasis>
         , Sir John reflected on both the fond and funny memories and the hardships of those early years on the land. He said that he would never forget:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the periodic droughts, the need to cart water to keep stock alive and for domestic purposes, the ravages of grasshoppers, butterflies and insects, and the plagues of locusts and mice. Then there was damage by rabbits, the sudden hailstorms and the heavy, biting frosts . . .
       </para>

        Indeed, it is a sad irony that on this very day, as we speak in support of this condolence motion for Sir John Cramer, there are too many farmers across the southern half of Australia facing those rigours which are once again due to the severity of a savage drought. While the challenges may have shifted slightly, there can be no doubt that a farm upbringing teaches you about the very essence of life—the hardships, the joys and the ups and downs it brings.

         On the lighter side, Sir John recalled his father's interest in racing dogs and, in particular, his champion dog with a rather politically incorrect name. I will not tell members of the House its name. They can look it up. He recalls how the district carnival races in those days used live hares and even cats as lures for the dogs. They would take a dog a quarter of a mile down the paddock and would then release a cat about 100 yards from the nearest protective shed. The result may have been bloody to see.

         In the early 1990s Sir John developed his conservative political leanings. He developed his confrontationist style at school and later in parliament, and often observers compared it with that of a bull at odds with a gate. His country upbringing gave him an understanding and close friendship with members of the then Country Party and particularly with people like Sir Arthur Fadden. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, in 1916 John Cramer moved to Sydney and began to pursue his interests in real estate, Paramount Pictures and other business.

         With the onset of the Great Depression and its devastating effect on people's lives, Sir John began to consider political solutions to Australians' problems. After a period as Mayor of North Sydney, Sir John, as one of a group, including Sir Robert Menzies, moved from the United Australia Party, the group holding a special conference in Canberra. The delegates then assembled in Albury, in the electorate of Farrer, in December 1944 to approve unanimously the decision to form a new Australian party—and so it was that the Liberal Party of Australia was born.

         A good illustration of Sir John's tenacity is that at a branch meeting in Bennelong in his electorate he was asked, `Mr Cramer, do you owe your allegiance to the Pope or to the King?' The question was disallowed, but Sir John jumped to his feet saying that he wanted to answer it anyhow. In his reply he said that it was an insult to be asked such a question as he was a loyal citizen of Australia and as a Catholic he thought it was not anyone's business but his own and it had nothing to do with the Liberal Party or with politics. His answer was greeted with applause. Thankfully this question would not be asked today, reflecting how things have changed. We can well do without this kind of sectarian politics and prejudging of people on their upbringing and background.

         He once tried to explain to an outsider what it was like to be in parliament. He told that person to imagine that there was a fellow with a machine-gun behind every bush and that one had to steer oneself through this hazard to make progress in parliament. That is possibly about right. Sir John was critical of parliament and believed that there was much room for improvement. However, he quickly pointed out that he also held the Australian system of government in very high regard. He thought the great weakness in a human being was the desire to pass the buck. He once said that everyone wanted to blame the other fellow. He made that point in respect of governments, politicians, bosses, unions, workers, companies, the press and even husbands and wives.

To live to the age of 98, no matter what your politics, your religion, your nationality, is a remarkable achievement. He predated the Commonwealth of Australia.

         He was different from many parliamentarians now in that he entered parliament as a remarkably successful businessman. He retained his business pursuits throughout the whole time he was in parliament, and at the age of 78 when he left parliament he returned to those business pursuits with great gusto. He was a very good local politician. He was highly regarded on the lower North Shore and, in fact, was patron of many clubs on the lower North Shore until the day he died. He was a regular at smokos at places like the North Ryde RSL right up until he died. He was very much one of the formative influences on business, and small business development in particular, on the lower North Shore.

         The Leader of the Opposition has already documented the contribution that John Cramer made to the formation of the Liberal Party. He held the seat of Bennelong with one near fright in 1961, when Harry Jensen ran him to within 300 votes in the credit squeeze election when Arthur Calwell was Leader of the Labor Party. Apart from that he held the seat very comfortably through that 24-year period. I found him a person possessed of a very robust sense of humour. It was once said of him that when he was Minister for the Army and was reviewing a passing-out parade on a large parade ground he turned and said, `General, this would make a remarkably good subdivision.' He was a person who preserved his interest in real estate matters and in small business throughout the whole of the time that he spent in politics.

         He was in a sense a person who came before the age of career parliamentarians, although he himself had a very long parliamentary career. He followed the path that is not followed quite so frequently now of people who have a long tutelage in local government or semi-government instrumentalities and then go into federal parliament. That seems to be more of a rarity these days than it was in the 1940s and the 1950s. He belonged to that unique brand of Australian Liberals of having been a 49er, somebody who came in with that great blush in, as the Leader of the Opposition reminds me, a good year indeed—I say to the Leader of the Opposition an absolutely vintage year of 1949. But he did belong to that very special breed.

It was appropriate that two of the mourners at his funeral were the former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Lady Sonia McMahon, the widow of the former Liberal Prime Minister Sir William McMahon, of whom Sir John Cramer was a very close friend. On behalf of the electorate of Bennelong, I record my gratitude and that of the people of Bennelong for his long and dedicated and committed service to the people of Bennelong.

         Sir John Cramer was one of the founders of the Liberal Party who will go down in Australian history as a great man, not only as the member for Bennelong, but for the total public spiritedness and real activity of his 98 years. The present member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who has himself celebrated his 20th anniversary in this place, gave an outstanding eulogy to Sir John. It merely remains for me to pay tribute to the great impression he made on me—and he certainly did. His son Erle has had a medical practice in my electorate for many years and still lives down there. I have maintained a family connection over a very long period.

The fact certainly gives me great hope and a certain further ambition. But I must correct one difference I have with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer): for 78 of Sir John's 98 years he was interested in dealing in land, not farming it. I think that should be recorded in this tribute.

He was a big man in the political sense and certainly in terms of his community involvement. In the Sydney City Council he set a standard for borrowing funds overseas, which I think would be to the credit of any Treasurer in the Australian parliament at present. He did outstanding work as Mayor of North Sydney Council and also as the federal member for Bennelong. On page 222 of his biography, which happens to be the last page, he made the point which I think was emphasised very clearly by other speakers here today:

        Throughout his life Sir John Cramer set an example of community spirit. He set an example of what the individual could do for the community in the wider sense of the word. It is interesting in that context to note that he claimed that throughout his life, especially his public life, he had carried three crosses. The first was his real estate occupation, the second was his German ancestry and the third was his Catholic faith. It must be remembered that he was in public life throughout the period of the Great War, as well as the Second World War. Consequently, we can see the difficulties he would have had at that particular time, having a German name. Reference to his Catholic faith has already been well documented by my colleagues.

         It is also true that during the 1930s through to the 1950s, Australian politics was unduly affected by sectarian divisions. Just as the Australian Labor Party clearly had a substantial number of Catholics within its midst, it also followed that in the conservative parties non-Catholics made up the majority. Nevertheless, Sir John was the first to break that mould. Others followed him to the extent that today, the Liberal Party is truly a universal party which covers people of all faiths.

         It is also worth noting that Sir John referred to the need to have a national conservative party, though based in the Burkean liberal tradition, which would bring within itself all components of the Australian community. For example, I am sure he would have taken great pleasure to know that in his own state of New South Wales we have in Helen Shan-Ho an Australian-Chinese member of parliament—the first for this nation. I hope we will see in future years a greater expansion of the coverage of the various ethnic communities within this parliament so that the Liberal Party can be the inclusive party which Sir John played such a substantial role in creating in the years between 1941 and 1944.

That will be his testament to this great year, the 50th anniversary of the party.

He was probably the most dominant figure of the lower North Shore for most of the 20th century. That is not an exaggeration. He was an alderman of the North Sydney Council for 10 years, councillor of the Sydney County Council for 14 years and the federal member for Bennelong for 25 years, fighting his way through 10 very controversial elections. On two occasions it was very close: the election in 1961, which the honourable member for Bennelong has mentioned, and again in 1972. He also ran a very successful but very controversial real estate agency in the area for nearly 60 years.

         He had few setbacks although, as he pointed out himself, the three crosses he had to bear, I think, caused problems for him in local government. In 1941 he lost office after 10 years in the North Sydney Council. I think it was because of prejudice to his ancestry and the very great sectarianism that existed at that time. He was always a prominent figure, both here and locally. He was a physical giant and, for many who did not know him, he had a stentorian voice and he gave forth many forthright and controversial views. When the Whitlam government was elected in 1972, he said:

       <para>
        But, on the other hand, many in the government ranks would agree with his very forthright views on growth and development, particularly of natural resources. He was a very strong supporter of Arthur Calwell's immigration policies and the call to `populate or perish'.

         He was a great orator right through to his nineties and gave many great speeches locally. I remember recently at the North Sydney olympic pool on its 50th anniversary he welcomed everyone to the pool pointing out that he was the owner because of the 25 names on the opening plaque he was the only one still alive. He still made the front pages of the local papers on regular occasions right up to the last few months. In the public arena, he was confrontational in the extreme, but personally he was a gentleman. While he gave me many lectures on my misdeeds at local, state and federal level, privately he was extremely helpful. I think he has left many legacies for the people of the area. His political views were certainly unambiguous and consistent, unlike those of most of us here. He lived with a very clear sense of personal and political values and had a life of amazing longevity and achievement, which is something to which we can all aspire.

As a consequence, there was an enormous increase in employment in this country over the course of this government's period in office. In 1983, six million people were in the work force of this country; there are nearly eight million today. So if one looks at household disposable income, it rose in every year the government has been in office because more people in households were in work. This cuts right through any analysis of simply looking at the income of a particular person. Let me repeat that: there has been employment growth of multiples of what you were able to attain.

Need I say that the measures I announced in the white paper this month will build on those achievements by reducing unemployment, removing poverty traps and introducing the parenting allowance, which will mean that 120,000 low income families will receive on average an extra $59 a week.

         I conclude by making the following point. The question comes from the Leader of the Opposition, whose policy is to have no underpinning of award payments and conditions in this country. He would have a free-fall of wages, particularly seeing to beat-up on people on $360 and $370 a week. It is a shame that the Liberal Party has always supported these policies, but it is a double shame, in still supporting them, asking a question without any integrity.

         The D-day landings were a dramatic attempt to gain a foothold on continental Europe from which Nazi Germany could be driven back and it is one of the best examples ever of successful international cooperation. It was primarily a United Kingdom-United States operation and most of the troops participating in the landings were from the United Kingdom, the United States and from Canada, but Australia also made a noteworthy contribution.

         All told, an estimated 2,600 Australian servicemen actually took part in the landings or the related air and sea operations. Australia's main contribution was through the RAAF, which had several squadrons under the empire air training scheme and which operated in effect as Australian squadrons. As many as 2,100 RAAF air crews were involved. Probably around 500 navy personnel were among those embarked on ships associated with the famous channel crossing. Some commanded some of the small vessels which typified the D-day landings and became such a powerful symbol of the struggle against Nazi occupied Europe. A small number of Australian army troops also took part.

I refer the Prime Minister again to the Australian Bureau of Statistics study released last week which noted that under Labor's policies the number of long-term unemployed between 1989 and 1993 more than trebled, to 334,000 people. Why is it, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics notes, that in contrast to the rapid recovery after the 1982-83 recession employment remained virtually unchanged over the two years following the trough of the 1990-91 recession? Was this just callous indifference on the part of the government to the victims of its recession, or was it simply the result of the government's economic mismanagement?

         —The Prime Minister whom the Leader of the Opposition worked for inherited an unemployment rate of five per cent and left this government a legacy of 11 per cent unemployment. Let us just get that on the record. The then coalition government had appalling rates of economic growth and appalling rates of employment growth because it could not manage inflation and it could not manage the economy. I have said often in this House, and I will repeat it, that when this government took office in 1983 the sense of relief—not a sense of defeat but the sense of relief—on the face of coalition ministers that the problem had been passed to somebody else was palpable.

         As a consequence, we saw the fastest rate of employment growth in the OECD in Australia between 1983 and 1990. We often hear members opposite talking about New Zealand. I have made the point in this House before, and I will make it again: until recently there were more people in work in New Zealand than there were in 1983. Until about nine months ago there were fewer people in work in New Zealand than there were in 1983, and in this country there were 26 per cent more people in work.

New Zealand has barely recovered. In fact, GDP in New Zealand is just back to where it was in 1986—right now! So I would not think our conservative friends opposite should beat a drum about their philosophy. If the Leader of the Opposition is so interested in the long-term unemployed, let him more fulsomely embrace the white paper proposals. Let him understand that the commitment that the government has to the long-term unemployed is a very profound one. Let me remind him of his party's view at the last election where, until pressure was exerted in this parliament to change Fightback, you were going to drop people off unemployment benefits after nine months. How callous can you get! There would not be a conservative party like you anywhere in the world. I have the old Acme Fightback here. Here it is.

        I also recall the Leader of the Opposition, when shadow Treasurer—let me just shuffle through my notes quickly—saying that the budget deficit needed to be under $13 billion because otherwise it would put pressure on interest rates. Well, of course with the budget outcome as it was, I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, the then shadow Treasurer, would have acknowledged that the government had done that very thing and avoided the very rise in interest rates which he permitted.

         Mr Mercer has had a view—not obviously a representative view, but a view—about the budget and the only question can be the question of the marginally higher financing task of $1 billion or so in the non-appropriation of funding towards the white paper objectives. When one gets to the question of national economic efficiency, when one has to consider whether taking 320,000 Australians who have been unemployed for 12 months and more and retraining them and bringing them back into skills formation in this economy is a more efficient thing to do than the marginally lower financing task, leading possibly and of course unrealistically to a lower level of interest rates, there is no macro-economic judgment to be made. It had to be made for the white paper initiatives.

The same cannot be said for the honourable member for Bennelong, who as late as a few days ago was talking of these new dismissal protection provisions needing to be suspended—the whole lot of the protections swept away; that was his plan.

         Under the IR reform act, the basis of our federal unfair dismissal protection is ILO convention 158. As I announced earlier today, the operation of the convention in Australia, and therefore the federal unfair dismissal procedures, will be amended to cap compensation for award employees to six months salary or $30,000 for non-award employees earning less than $60,000 per annum. We will also be modifying the onus of proof in unfair dismissal cases to ensure that it is shared between employers and the dismissed employees. These amendments are aimed squarely at giving employers the confidence to take on new employees as the recovery gains momentum.

         In terms of supply, the graphic illustration shows the line running up the top of the chart from somewhere between $6 billion in 1991-92 and $7 1/2 billion in terms of equipment importations. I think the DFAT work is a more reliable guide than simply relying upon one month's balance of payment figures.

She does not seem to have noticed it. She does not seem to have noticed either that some $9 billion a year is lost to the Australian economy because of this drug. Most of it is in health costs. The research that has been going on for the last 30 years—and I am quite happy to have a briefing provided for the honourable member for Mackellar—shows that tobacco is a significant factor in lung cancer, the deadliest cancer in the country.

The status of the honourable member who interjected during the Prime Minister's answer and who is yet to reveal whether he feels himself demoted on merit or for some other reason is indeterminate, but it appears that he is also a parliamentary secretary.

I will go through the salaries of ministers, which is something directly within my purview as Minister for Finance. The salaries would amount to some $50,000 apiece. Expenses of office or costs met by the departments for parliamentary secretaries would be about $8,000 apiece. Staff salaries would be $350,000 apiece for the ministers and $80,000 for the parliamentary secretaries. The staff travel budget would be $105,000 for the ministers and $30,000 for the parliamentary secretary. Office space, depending on the amount taken, would be around $18,000. That does not give any indication of the expenses for each of those minister in terms of travel costs and travel allowances. There would be a very substantial amount of money available for that. The suggestion that our commitment to leaner and more efficient government is somehow served by the expansion of the ministry is complete nonsense.

         —I thought that was a well-timed statement by the governor to remind people, particularly banks saying to borrowers that they can extend their debt, that they can take on other categories of lending under the collateral security of their home and lending at rates of 100 per cent of debt against properties was a timely reminder to the banking system, particularly the major banks, that they have a role to perform in business in this country—to do that which they should be doing and have a mandate to do—as well as in housing. The advertisements on television piling up the swimming pool and the holiday on top of the house are an indication of where the major banks stand. The regional banks, feeling that they are under undue competition from the four majors, are lending at 100 per cent financing and that is not wise for funds.

         Mr Speaker, you might recall that in the One Nation statement the government increased the rate of interest on non-callable deposits to commercial rates of interest which provided about $140 million worth of value to the banking system, in the main the major four banks. The purpose of that was to focus on business lending, and particularly small business lending, to improve manager-client relationships to give managers the capacity to peruse and understand balance sheets and to be able to make judgments about the bankability of a business and develop client relationships with that business.

         It was also a device in the early days of the recovery to cover some of any of the attendant risk of more prominent lending to small business. We are not seeing the levels of lending which I think the four major banks should be involved with. They say there is not the demand. But it is a chicken and egg situation; if they do not go looking for the business they will miraculously find there is not much demand. The fact of the matter is that housing has become an easy resort for lending for the major banks. As a consequence of that, it has been proven over the last decade that housing has a very low level of risk—and this is particularly so with the risk rates under the BIS conventions—the banks are lending heavily for housing. I think the governor's remarks about housing lending that he made privately to the banks and then the remarks he made, over the banks' heads, to the public about the attendant risk of heavy financings of up to 100 per cent of equity and adding to that, are timely. As to the interest rate implications, if we end up with a recovery of the kind we are seeing now with—

I should underpin the governor's confidence and remarks about inflation. This should be taken notice of by the opposition which should at least wonder why that low inflation rate is there.

The Prime Minister has already dealt with the issue of inequality, the impact of government policy and the fact that the figures talked about were in gross terms and failed to take account of the impact of the tax transfer system. Another aspect that has been emphasised by the opposition's spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Berowra, is the number of people supposedly on welfare.

        That is a very interesting proposition. Yes, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of people on various social security payments. That has been the result of a variety of factors. We have had an ageing population, which has led to an increase in the number of aged pensioners, from around 930,000 ten years ago to about 1 1/2 million now.

But the difficulty faced by the opposition when it has tried to attribute this to government policies is that the great bulk of that increase occurred during the period 1975 to 1983, that is, when the opposition was in office. That is obviously the case with the unemployment payments. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, we inherited a rate of unemployment close to 11 per cent.

         Take the number of sole parent pensioners. This is a group that is constantly maligned by conservative spokesmen in our country—a group of people who need assistance, which we are providing through the JET scheme and in other ways. The suggestion has been made that government policy has somehow caused a massive increase. The fact is that from 1975 to 1983 the average annual rate of growth in the number of people on sole parent pension was 10 per cent. From 1983 to 1993 it has been three per cent. Again, if you look at all these categories of payments, you will see that the rapid acceleration occurred under your tenure. During the 1980s we have targeted the system better, we have introduced more effective compliance measures, we have improved the real level of benefit for those who really need it and we have produced a more efficient and effective instrument for the prevention of poverty in our society.

         Another point that requires emphasis is that you cannot just look at the absolute numbers of people on the various payments. A good proportion of people on the various pensions and benefits are on less than the full rate because of earnings from non-government sources, from investments and from personal exertion. One of the impacts of government policy over the past decade has been to significantly increase the proportion of people on various payments who are able to derive significant income from non-government sources.

         Take sole pensioners. The proportion of sole parents who are earning significant non-government income so that that reduces their pension payments has fallen. The proportion of sole parents receiving a full pension, that is, not having any other source of income, fell from 84 per cent in 1983 to 50 per cent in 1993. A similar pattern occurs in all the other payments: with the age pension it is the same thing; unemployment, the same thing; disability, the same thing.

         There have been significant reductions in the numbers who are solely dependent on government payments for their income support. That is a deliberate consequence of government policy, of measures to reduce the barriers to work force participation, such as the JET scheme, the disability reform program and the unemployment measures. They have been taken a significant step further recently with the white paper measures that have been announced, including the job compact and the measures in that area. Also in the social security area we have redesigned the income support system to comprehensively remove disincentives to work force participation. That is the way to address this issue and get the numbers of people dependent on benefits down.

So that is why in getting around the business community in the last week or two—and I had a chance to talk to the Australian Mining Industry Council with Prime Minister Wingti of Papua New Guinea and other members of the business community in Melbourne—and particularly over the last week, they are saying that they are very confident about the prospects for investment, as I am, too.

         —I grieve for the taxpayers of Australia and for the future of this nation. I grieve because it is the taxpayers who are being forced to pay the price of the determination of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to buy himself victory at the next election, using assets belonging to all Australians. I grieve because it is becoming increasingly clear to me and to all of my constituents that it is the government's intention to sell off assets belonging to the taxpayers of Australia to create stopgap training programs and short-term employment under the job compact which was announced in the white paper on unemployment. The government is selling off the farm, piece by piece, with no long-term or permanent benefit to the people of this nation.

         The government has already indicated that it is considering privatising Tullamarine airport, the AIDC, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, and a number of other major components of Australia's public assets. That may be fine; my party has a policy of privatisation of certain government assets. But the difference in the approach of the Keating government and our party is that we look for a permanent benefit. All of the policies of the Keating government have been short term: `Put a bit of bandaid over it, a bit of putty over the cracks, and let us move towards the next election.'

         Australian Defence Industries operates a heavy engineering facility in my electorate of Bendigo. It is more than likely that the 450 permanent jobs at that facility could be sacrificed in favour of temporary positions in areas anywhere in Australia—short-term jobs. The jobs that the ADI personnel hold down are in a high-tech, highly skilled defence area. They are permanent jobs in an industry which is internationally sensitive, and which is involved in strategic defence issues, including the manufacture of ordnance and armaments, yet they could be tossed aside to help this government create the illusion of growing employment. It really is an illusion because the white paper does not provide employers with any incentives to create new and permanent jobs. The job compact is merely an election ploy—a not so cheap trick, with $6.5 billion of taxpayers' money which the Prime Minister hopes will win him the next election.

         The ALP and the union movement spent almost half a million dollars trying to win the seat of Bendigo at the last election. I am pleased to report that they failed miserably. They have now given up that fight, so the Prime Minister does not care about the impact his job compact might have on Bendigo's local economy and he is moving in the direction of privatisation of that facility.

         The white paper is all about tampering with and reducing the unemployment figures in time for an election in late 1995. The starting date for most of the schemes announced in the white paper is 1 July 1995. There are 233,451 long-term unemployed. Mr Deputy Speaker, think about that large number of people—233,451—who have been out of work in this country for 18 months or longer. Five months after 1 July 1995, in about October or November, the schemes announced in the white paper will still have a few months left to run. The Prime Minister will rush off to the polls hoping that, by taking these people off the long-term unemployed list and putting them into the job compact for between six and nine months employment, Australians will believe his illusion that the unemployment rate has fallen.

There is no encouragement for the public or private sectors to improve the economic situation so that people can get a permanent job in industry and commerce.

         Look at the work that was done on the green paper. A task force went throughout Australia, at huge expense to the Victorian taxpayer, and came back with a lot of answers which the government preferred to ignore. One of the green paper's major recommendations to the government was the development of infrastructure in regional areas of Australia. The budget did not allocate additional money to the development of infrastructure. The government has ignored that recommendation; it has walked away from it. After all the work that task force did throughout Australia in trying to identify problems, I should imagine that the chairman of the task force, Mr Kelty, would be greatly upset by the government's inaction.

         —My grievance concerns the method of distribution of the $1 billion annual program of financial assistance grants to local government. It is now appropriate, in the context of a growth economy—4.5 per cent growth in the coming financial year—to drive greater equity into all funding programs. Too often notions of social justice are dealt with in a theoretical sense without a clear program of reform. An essential starting point is to ensure that funding programs effectively target the needs of disadvantaged areas and regions. This is a timely grievance, as the government is presently reviewing the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. The review and its outcome should adopt the following principles.

         The first principle is to support the role played by local government in the provision of quality of life services. The stereotype in Australian local government of roads, rates and rubbish is now as outdated and old fashioned as the Liberal Party. Four of the five quality of life services in this country are provided by local government: libraries, child care, recreation and cultural facilities. Only education is kept as a state government service. Services like this are essential in promoting a better quality of life in disadvantaged areas and regions.

         In Australia, inequality depends as much on where people live and their access to basic services as their access to satisfactory incomes. In affluent local government areas, people have better access through personal incomes and the purchase of private services. They can buy personal libraries instead of using public libraries. They can purchase  cultural and recreational services instead of using community facilities, and they can purchase a greater amount of private child care instead of using publicly provided facilities. In less affluent, more disadvantaged local government areas, these public services take on immense importance and give immense opportunity for promoting the quality of life.

         The second reform that the act should embrace is to drive greater equity into the allocation of financial assistance grants to local government around Australia. The current system relies on equal per capita grants to each state. The State Grants Commission then allocates funds through the horizontal equalisation principle, which means it promotes equalisation of the capacity to provide services by each local government authority, not equalisation of outcomes for the quality of life in each local government area. There is only a loose correlation between socioeconomic need and the scale of grants.

         In Victoria, for instance, in 1991-92, the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of councils averaged grants of $47.77 per capita, while the second most advantaged quarter of councils—that is, those in the 50 to 75 per cent range—received $56.52 per capita. In Western Australia, the second quarter of councils received substantially lower per capita grants than the more affluent third quarter. In Tasmania, the second quarter received substantially higher grants than the more disadvantaged first quarter. The state local government grants commissions are not applying indices of socioeconomic need in the allocation of their grants. Australia-wide this results in $200 million of financial assistance and road grants to local government being provided to the 22 per cent most affluent and most advantaged local government areas.

         So, on needs based criteria, we cannot defend the way in which state grants commissions are currently undertaking their work and gearing up their funding formulae. There are two reasons for this. No state includes in its funding formula a reliable measure of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. That in Australia in the 1990s is absolutely indefensible. In 1986 perhaps it could be understood because the ABS and the Australian Taxation Office had not devised indices of socioeconomic advantage. But, as the current discussion paper provides, they are available and should be picked up in an amendment to the legislation and used by the state local government grants commissions.

         The second source of inequity is the distortion provided by the requirement for 30 per cent of funds in each state to be distributed on a per capita basis. This, too, is indefensible in Australia in the 1990s when more disadvantaged communities need the funds that currently we allocate to each community, irrespective of its need; that is, the 30-per cent per capita basis.

         The third principle that should be followed in reviewing and reforming the legislation is the integration of specific purpose road grants into global grant allocations. At the moment we have a substitution effect whereby, no matter the size of the road grants, the local government authority simply substitutes what it would have spent out of its own resources of revenue, replacing it with the revenue provided by the State Grants Commission and the federal distribution of grants. This was best pointed out by the Self report into local government finance in 1985. Even National Party members opposite could turn to page 351 of the Self report and read its conclusion:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . road grants to local government are very close to general purpose assistance, especially since nothing is done to counter substitution effects at the local government level and ensure that the money actually leads to increased spending on roads . . . in the longer run it would be desirable to absorb the Commonwealth grant for local roads into the program of general purpose assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is where the report ends its conclusion. Of course, this principle would be totally consistent with local government autonomy. If a local government authority wanted to take all the money that was allocated to it by the Commonwealth and through the state commission and spend it on roads, that should be its choice. Equally, if a local government authority, responding to local need and circumstance, wanted to take all the funds that had been allocated to it and spend them on libraries, recreational facilities or other quality of life services, that should be at its discretion. As a rule, the decisions thrust upon local government from Canberra are poor decisions; decisions that reinforce local government autonomy and local discretion are good decisions. That should be an important part of changes to the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is also a problem in the way in which state funding formulae currently disadvantage local government authorities in urban areas for the allocation of road grants when they have a substantial rural road network. We have an artificial distinction and funding divide for so-called rural and so-called urban councils which takes no account of the unique needs in western Sydney, for instance, of classified urban councils which have substantial networks of rural roads.

         The fourth principle which should be followed in reforming the legislation is to restore a component of local capital works program, such as that introduced by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) during his term as local government minister. That was a very successful program that provided, in particular, disadvantaged local government areas with their best opportunity to provide the community buildings, the recreation services, the cultural services and the libraries that otherwise could not be funded out of their annual budget. To restore that program out of the current allocation of just more than $1 billion in local government grants would be of enormous benefit to disadvantaged areas and regions throughout Australia.

         In particular, the government should be taking the Horton report into public library funding off the shelf, where it has sat since 1975. In Australia the upgrade of municipal libraries has not been part of the general upgrade of education institutions in Australia in the 1980s and 1990s. This government has done it for child care, school education, TAFE and universities. Federal responsibilities to fund municipal libraries should be picked up in the review of the legislation. These library grants should be made through capital assistance to avoid the sort of substitution effect that occurs with grants for recurrent purposes, as we see with the current allocation of road grants.

         The fifth principle that should be adopted in reforming the legislation is to drive an efficiency dividend into local government by rewarding those councils that have reformed their management practices—that is, brought themselves out of the 1950s right into the 1990s through corporate styles of management, greater efficiency and corporatising various functions, as we see at the more advanced councils that have also engaged in innovative enterprise bargaining arrangements. Rewarding efficient councils would be a most worthwhile practice in the review of the local government legislation.

         I would recommend strongly that the federal grants be distributed in the following proportions: 70 per cent of the funding, that is, a little more than $740 million in 1993-94, for horizontal equalisation distributed by the state grant commissions; 20 per cent of the funding, a little more than $200 million, for capital works funding distributed authority by local government authority, giving a high preference to quality of life services in areas of greatest socioeconomic need; and 10 per cent for efficiency incentives and rewards available to all councils distributed by local government state grant commissions. I look forward to the completion of the review and the incorporation of these provisions in the legislation by way of amendment.

I would like to share with honourable members some of my experiences and the concerns and difficulties faced by people in the bush. In the first week I travelled with the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who is at the table, on what is known as the Kidman Way, or rather the unsealed section of it, which is about half the road that exists between Hillston in the south and up through Cobar to Bourke in the north. That stretch of road is about 408 kilometres long and 190 of those kilometres are unsealed.

         The significance of this route is that people can travel directly north from Melbourne right through to Mount Isa and Darwin on a sealed stretch, except for this small area which remains unsealed. It is a flat, straight stretch and construction costs to bitumen this road are quite low—of the order of $100,000 to $125,000 per kilometre. I believe it is a very important section of road, because it would give an alternative route to road transport as well as to tourists and would tend to open up that particular inland section of Australia.

About 100 people were there to see us off in the Carrathool shire. We went north from there, soon leaving the bitumen a few kilometres out of the town and on to some of the roughest road surfaces that any member would ever wish to travel on.

One person who sticks in my mind is Bernadette McMillan, who runs the shop and the mail run in conjunction with her husband. She said to me that they have to change their car tyres every 15,000 kilometres; in other words, they change their tyres about three times a year. At $100 a tyre, it would cost them $1,200 each year for car tyres just on one vehicle, whereas normally it would cost about $400. So the state of the road has added about $800 in costs to one small business just from the cost of car tyres, let alone the cost of the wear and tear on the vehicle and on the human beings who have to drive it.

I must take my hat off to Margie Haley, the principal, who has 23 children in the school—50 per cent of them are Aboriginal—as well as the preschool classes that are run there. There is no rubbish in the school, no graffiti and very low absenteeism; the school itself is a credit to her and should be a model for other schools throughout New South Wales. The school was concerned, though, that because the town is so small there is no 60 kilometre zone outside the school. So when the children cross the main road they are sometimes subject to road transport going through at high speed. I will be following this up.

         —I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I invite you to come down to the state of Victoria to see what happens when Fightback is implemented by a conservative government. You can have a look at the massive cuts in infrastructure. Obviously you support the closure of at least 20 rural hospitals. You stand here as a rural representative and say that you support it. I will go back to Victoria quite happily and say that the National Party in Australia supports the Victorian National Party in closing rural hospitals. I am pleased to be able to say that because that is what would happen with Fightback—$10 billion in cuts. You never read the document, obviously. The Victorian government is destroying the infrastructure of Victoria, destroying rural Victoria, closing rural schools, closing rural hospitals and taking funding off rural councils for roads. This is obviously what the National Party supports.

         I draw attention to another problem in Victoria, which is a direct result of Liberal-National Party policy: the attack on the judicial system and on the very foundation of justice in this country. The massive cuts to the judicial system in Victoria are causing grave concerns across the board and are producing results adverse to justice. My particular concern today is with the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the matter of the Queen v. Wilson and Grimwade. It involves a case known as the Jet Corp case.

         In my view, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria came to a very perverse finding indeed—a finding which throws into doubt whether or not white-collar criminals can properly be dealt with by the judicial system of our country. It throws into doubt whether the Melbourne Club has more power than even I suspected and it throws justice into doubt.

         It involves a company called Jet Corporation Australia Pty Ltd. In September 1981 Huttley, a chartered accountant versed in tax minimisation schemes, Collier and the applicant Wilson became its directors. The Jet Corporation Australia Trust was, according to its trustee, established on 20 December 1981 and consisted of 100 units of $150,000 each. The trustee was JCA, or Jet Corporation Australia Pty Ltd.

         At that time a long established business known as Schutt Aviation was engaged in the acquisition, operation and sale of commercial aircraft, carried on in Moorabbin in Victoria. Wilson was involved with that, together with one called Sent and one called Forshaw. The purposes of the JCA Trust were to acquire the aircraft business for $12 million and then conduct it. Those who stood to benefit from the JCA's acquisition and conduct of the aircraft business were Huttley, Collier, Dyer, Wilson and Sir Andrew Grimwade. The last is a well-known businessman, member of the Melbourne Club, prominent member of the Liberal Party and known to many.

         The simple facts of this case are not in dispute. A prospectus was put out which was dishonest. Among other things, that prospectus said that Grimwade would be taking a subscription in the trust. That was not true. Grimwade was paid $900,000-odd for lending his name to a false prospectus. None of these facts are in dispute. It was a major white-collar crime one would think worthy of punishment. Yet, when we find out what happened, we really have to scratch our heads and ask seriously whether or not white-collar criminals are dealt with properly in this country.

         The investigation was conducted by the National Crime Authority—it put together a brief for prosecution and the prosecution was conducted by the DPP of Victoria—and at the committal proceedings Collier, Huttley and Dyer pleaded guilty. Huttley gave evidence for the Crown against Wilson and Grimwade. The jury, after a long and complicated trial, found Grimwade and Wilson guilty.

         I accept that there were major problems in the trial. The bar of Victoria should really think seriously about the performance of the barristers in that trial. The Supreme Court, in my view quite fairly, criticised the barristers concerned because they, quite frankly, made a mess of it. They prolonged the trial to the extent that that was the ground for the appeal. So here is a system of justice in which three people pleading guilty have been convicted, one giving evidence against two co-offenders, and the trial is run in such a way as to make it complicated, to prolong the trial to nearly 21 months.

         One must also raise the issue that the judge was involved in other matters and could not sit consistently on the trial.

That is a grave concern in the way justice is run.

         The barrister, appointed I understand for Wilson by Legal Aid, was severely criticised by the appellate court. According to the judgment, he behaved in a way which was unnecessary and caused grave concern about the conduct of the trial. That is all very well. I am not here to support barristers. I want to know why white-collar criminals cannot get convicted. Nevertheless, the judges raised that as a serious concern. In the course of the judgment the judges raised this very interesting question. They said:

        The question we are to consider is whether, in the circumstances we have described, there was a real danger that, as regards the applicant Grimwade, the jury failed to perform their function properly.

        It is interesting that Mr Chief Justice Phillips in the course of his judgment pointed out that his and the court's judgment was not to be seen as a finding of innocence of Mr Grimwade. That is a strange statement for an appellate court to make. I would have thought those who are practised in the law and who have heard many judgments would consider that that is a strange thing for a judge to say. He is really saying, `Despite the fact we are going to overturn a decision, we do in the process of overturning the decision nevertheless make the point that we do not find him innocent.' If he is not innocent, why is he not found guilty? If he is guilty, why has the system not properly found him guilty as the jury found him guilty and found Wilson guilty? It is unbelievable that a 21-month trial before a jury finds a verdict which can then be overturned by an appellate court under these circumstances.

         I firmly believe that many of those problems in Victoria are because of massive funding cuts to judges and the court system. I think some people at the bar need a good examination. We all know—we are seeing it in other court cases around Australia—that if one has the money, if one comes from privilege and one has wealth, one can use our judicial system to extend and delay to the extent that appellate courts will find that there is a problem with the trial because of length and delay. Then that person is off the hook. If that is what this House accepts as justice in white-collar crime areas and if that is what the state of Victoria accepts as justice in white-collar crime areas, then, frankly, I do not like it.

There must be a lot of people out there who feel quite sick in the stomach as a result of this decision by the appellate division of the Supreme Court. It is time we had a good look at justice and at the way white-collar criminals seem to manipulate the system because of wealth and privilege.

          —As members in this place will be very much aware, I have been very concerned at the movement of aircraft, particularly jet aircraft, over Botany Bay and its environs since I was first elected here in 1966. So it will come as no great surprise to realise that I am grieving very seriously in today's grievance debate about planes overflying the Sutherland shire. This movement is ostensibly because of the construction of the third runway at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport which, thanks to the skilful administration of the Federal Airports Corporation in Sydney, has been running ahead of its projected completion dates.

          I was informed by the FAC in Sydney last week that the completion of the physical construction of the third runway is expected to be 1 October 1994, which is eight months ahead of the original date of 1 June 1995. Even though the construction will be completed by 1 October this year, there remains much still to be done. For those of us who travel under the third runway on a regular basis, it is obvious that the new control tower is a good way off. I am informed that the third runway will not be fully operational until the middle of 1995, which is still nine months ahead of the FAC's original schedule. This is all well and good, and I congratulate Mr Bill Swingler and all his people at the FAC—contractors, managers, workers—for having achieved this great construction advantage by finishing everything nine months ahead of schedule, which is quite an achievement with public activities.

On the other hand, these same airport authorities know how angry I have been on behalf of my constituents that the site, as well as the noise of planes, is going to be the cause of great irritation and disturbance to my constituents until mid-1995.

Come on air traffic controllers, fly some of those aircraft over the recovering national park instead of over one of the loveliest parts of Australia, the Cook electorate, as you now do. This very day I had occasion to fly to and back from Sydney. We flew in a 737 over the national park, not over the Sutherland shire. This clearly shows to me that it can be done. So, air traffic controllers, how about changing the flights as of now, not waiting for another year?

For you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, not coming from Sydney, I point out that the Royal National Park in Sydney is the second oldest national park in the world. It was beaten by the famous one in the United States. It was one of the great tragedies of the bushfires that took place in Sydney a few months ago that this huge national park was 99 per cent destroyed, with rainforests totally eliminated.

         —I rise in the grievance debate to mention the future of the port of Geelong in my electorate. When Labor was elected to power in 1983, it embarked on a broad program of micro-economic reform like no other government had attempted before in the previous two decades. The government viewed the process of micro-economic reform as essential if the Australian economy was to successfully restructure and maintain its international competitiveness in the long term.

         An important part of that micro-economic reform agenda, which effectively commenced in 1984, has been the reform of the Australian waterfront. Plagued by gross economic inefficiencies that had developed over decades and by low productivity and high levels of industrial disputation, there was an urgent need to undertake meaningful reform and remove the impediments that were blocking an improvement to our export performance. The tortuous and essential waterfront reform program began in 1984. It had three main elements: firstly, to overhaul stevedoring employment arrangements; secondly, to implement port authority reforms; and, thirdly, to encourage greater competition in the industry and to ensure the benefits of reform were passed on to the users.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In all of these areas of reform, the government has been spectacularly successful. Those achievements include enterprise employment, which has brought waterfront employment in line with other Australian industries by making employers directly responsible for the recruitment of labour, enterprise training, wages and dispute settlement. Secondly, we have seen industrial award restructuring, which has resulted in a far more flexible and adaptable stevedoring work force. Thirdly, we have seen a rejuvenation of the waterfront work force, and we now have a far more flexible and adaptable work force in that area. Also, a more competitive structure has been created at the port level with the removal of industry employment arrangements which allow different ports the ability to pursue different and more appropriate strategies to improve efficiencies.

         The scorecard is fairly impressive. Cargo handling rates have risen by some 57 per cent. Ship turnaround times at container terminals have reduced by some 45 per cent. Improvements at bulk cargo handling ports have helped make Australian grain ports—I include the port of Geelong in this—among the most efficient in the world, with loading times on grain vessels reduced from 4.5 days in 1988 to 1.9 days in 1992.

         I am pleased to say that the port of Geelong in my electorate of Corio has embraced the reform process with an impressive sense of professionalism and considerable enthusiasm. The port of Geelong is the city of Geelong's gateway to the world. It is our gateway to the international commercial marketplace. The port is a critical facility that links existing road and rail infrastructure and a productive hinterland to that international marketplace. Therefore, it was absolutely critical that the quest for greater operating efficiencies be pursued professionally and with a minimum of disruption at that particular facility. This has been done and the results are quite outstanding.

         As far as the achievements of the port are concerned, over the past three years there has been a reduction of over 50 per cent in the permanent work force. But, more importantly, these labour reductions have been achieved in a spirit of cooperation between management and labour and without industrial disputation. Manning levels currently are around 150 and are programmed to reduce to 100 by the end of the year. Also there has been a multiskilling of the remaining work force and an improvement in ship turnaround time at the port. There has been a reduction in operating expenses and a lift in net profit. All these gains have been accompanied by increased benefits to the users of this port facility. The port has pursued a policy of divesting itself of non-core assets and unproductive assets and has, in recent times, embarked on a significant program of public investment.

         Two major recent investments are the modernisation of the bulk handling facilities and the deepening of approach channels to the port. The modernisation of bulk handling facilities at Lascelles wharf has cost $21 million. The program will improve productivity by 60-plus per cent and attract more industry into the Oyster Cove industrial land development area. The deepening of approach channels by one metre for 27 kilometres from the port has been a $35 million investment driven by the grain and oil industries. That will be completed in 1995.

         As far as its current economic and commercial performance are concerned, we have seen net profit increase to $8.5 million. Total revenue has increased by 15 per cent to $20 million in 1992-93. Cargo volumes have increased by 1.7 million tonnes—one million tonnes due to increased tonnages of petroleum products and 700,000 due to increased tonnages of grain. In that time, the authority's expenses fell by 23 per cent to achieve that improved profit performance.

         It is against this background that one must view with some concern recent press reports in Geelong suggesting that the Kennett government in Victoria has plans afoot to disaggregate the port's assets and to sell them off to the private sector. There are several significant disadvantages in this disaggregation suggestion. At a time when the port has achieved these record profit levels, the state government will cut itself off from a significant income stream and any  potential growth in that income stream in the future. There is also a potential for us to see a return to industrial confrontation. The needs of people who are currently working at the port really need to be taken into account. I am yet to be convinced that a disaggregation policy will improve services to the port's customers. The port has certainly improved its marketing performance and this has been reflected in higher turnover figures.

         I want to comment in the time I have remaining on the value of the port of Geelong to the Geelong community. It is something that ought to be injected into the decision equation when the Victorian government sits down and decides what policy it will pursue with regard to the port. Certainly, the port is a critical piece of economic infrastructure to the city and to the region. However, the authority, which has guided its development and its evolution, has played a far wider role in the economic forums of the city and in the life of the city. The Port of Geelong Authority has accumulated specialist skills and knowledge, which have been put to the advantage of the city of Geelong. It has achieved cooperation between management and labour which I think is a model for enterprises in the Geelong region.

         More importantly, it has been a catalyst for bringing together the private business community and the government sector. Those of us in Geelong who have been to the port of Geelong dinners, where issues of economic substance have been discussed and representatives of the private sector community and the government sector have come together around the dinner table to chew over these issues, can see the value of the port of Geelong in that networking process within a local  community.

         In addition, the Port of Geelong Authority has been a catalyst for undertaking significant lobbying efforts on behalf of the Geelong community. I refer to the lobbying which took place to have the standard gauge route from Adelaide to Melbourne relocated from Ballarat through Geelong.

         The port of Geelong was one of the coordinating mechanisms that brought the Geelong Regional Commission, the port of Geelong, political players, local employers, local unions and local government together to pursue that lobbying task and to have the standard gauge rerouted through Geelong. It was a particularly successful undertaking. It was typical of the role that has been played over time by the Port of Geelong Authority in the economic life of Geelong. It would be disappointing to see the Kennett government implement a policy of disaggregating the port assets and selling them off. It would lead to the dismembering of the Port of Geelong Authority and the significant loss of this facility to Geelong.

         It is important that the parliament should pass a good bill, not just any bill. This bill should not be passed without some essential amendments. The committee agrees with the objectives of the bill and the efforts to stamp out the conduct targeted by the bill. But we have to be careful. If we act in haste to address the problem of child sex tourism, there will be unintended consequences, including fundamental changes to our standards of justice.

         Australians travelling overseas have been able to abuse children sexually and escape the consequences of their behaviour once they have returned to Australia. The same conduct would be criminal if it were perpetrated in Australia. This conduct is repugnant to Australians and to the world, not least because of the devastating effect on children in the countries concerned. A secondary effect of this conduct is that it brings Australians into disrepute. Such conduct should be regarded as criminal, despite the fact that it occurs in other countries. Related conduct perpetrated in Australia—encouraging and benefiting—should also be proscribed in the Commonwealth Crimes Act.

         From the beginning of our consideration of the bill, concerns were expressed about provisions in the bill which, in the view of many eminent legal practitioners who gave evidence, contain unacceptable changes to criminal law principles and procedures. These include apparent short cuts to assist the prosecution because of the practical difficulties of conducting a successful prosecution. Examples are the reversal of the onus of proof in clause 50CC and the arrangements for estimating the age of the child in clause 50FA.

         The committee believes that certain clauses can be successfully redrafted to ensure the bill is effective and enforceable without abandoning the safeguards that have been traditional elements of the criminal law in Australia. In reconsidering the bill, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and his department should consult widely with practitioners in order to discover solutions to some of the practical and legal problems identified by the committee. The committee has been informed by the New South Wales Bar Association and by individual barristers, Mr James QC and Mr Sides QC, that they would be happy to assist the minister with the bill. These offers were made to assist the legislation to pass through both houses on a bipartisan basis.

         The issues raised in this report and those identified by the committee as not being given full attention by the government have been quite diverse. Firstly, the committee realised how difficult it would be to gain sound evidence under the terms of pursuing somebody for a crime committed outside of Australia. The former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), is in the chamber. I know that he would acknowledge some of the difficulties experienced, first of all, with the war crimes legislation and the concept of pursuing somebody for prosecution, albeit 40 years after the event, with evidence from overseas—bringing witnesses to Australia and cross-examining them here—or with people not understanding Australian law.

         There is a greater complexity in this legislation. With respect to the possibility of video linked evidence, there may be interference with witnesses as they provide evidence in a studio or in a venue where only part of the environment can be seen.

         The role of state governments is also of concern to the committee.

         The committee proposes that maximum offences be in place for crimes committed against children under the age of 16. We believe that, in sentencing, the courts should take note of the age of children, but that there should be no exception with respect to age, as the government originally proposed in its legislation. I have a slightly different view from that of my colleagues which is not expressed in the dissenting report. I find that, on balance, the proposition contained in recommendation 18 may allow otherwise sound prosecutions to fail. The obnoxious character of this trade leads me to conclude that defence based on belief of age must be proved on the balance of probabilities. I am seeking to reverse the onus of proof on the probability of age. I think the defence needs to demonstrate beyond doubt that the person involved in this obnoxious process did have grounds to believe that the person was over the age of 16.

         My learned colleagues failed to convince me that there needs to be consistency between laws which apply to individuals committing an offence within Australia and those which apply to individuals committing the same offence in a foreign country.

We do not believe that consent should form part of the defence. So we have taken a stronger view than the government in that regard. We considered the issue of corroborating evidence and we do not believe that corroborating evidence is necessary. This legislation should be passed as quickly as possible.

         Clause 50FC of the bill provided that a judge may direct a new trial for an alternative offence. A day after we started these proceedings, a joint news release was put out by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). It said that the government had proposed workable and effective legislation to dramatically improve the chance of securing convictions of Australians who engage in this sordid trade in young children. Whilst every single person in this place agrees with the sentiments behind that, we could not agree that this legislation which we were asked to look at was either workable or effective. In fact, it was anything but that.

         One example of that was clause 50FC, which is referred to in that press release as part of workable and effective legislation. It was an attempt to reflect the common law position that a jury cannot convict an accused of an offence of an entirely different character from that alleged in the indictment, as set out in paragraph 6.4.1 of our report. This section attracted universal criticism. It attracted criticism from people such as Mr James QC and Mr Sides QC. Mr James's views are set out in paragraph 6.4.2. Even stronger was the criticism from Mr Sides QC. He said:

        This is an attempt to try and codify a procedural matter, and I fear that in that attempt there will be miscarriages of justice. The procedures are already there to ensure that justice occurs, and I do not think there ought to be an attempt to qualify, or codify them, or put them in a straitjacket. I do not think that proposed section 50FC, in any shape or form, is necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The committee therefore recommends that clause 50FC be deleted. The reason I touch on that is that, if this committee is to work effectively, the ministers concerned—in this instance, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice—ought to show a little more maturity than to issue a press release on 19 May, after we had our first hearing on 18 May, pouring a bucket on the committee. They said that they rejected assertions that had been made in the standing committee the day before. They asserted that the presumption of innocence and a fair trial are established principles of Australian justice and that those rights would not be compromised by this legislation. We did not agree with that.

We certainly hope that it is not the last time, although I mention another point raised by the honourable member for Mitchell—that we would not want the same time constraint placed upon the committee as was the case with this bill.

Firstly, the bill has come forward with bipartisan support, but as a result of the committee's deliberations I believe it will be in a much improved form. The second point, which was touched on by, particularly, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), is that this is the first occasion on which a House of Representatives standing committee has had a bill referred to it for review and an advisory report. In my former capacity as the shadow Attorney-General I was delighted to have been, in effect, responsible for that having happened. The cooperative manner in which all members of the committee worked together, the resulting report and, if the recommendations are accepted, the resulting legislation will stand as a monument to the participation of committee members in the legislative process.

         The legislation was adventurous and innovative but unfortunately its format when presented did not strike an appropriate balance between the conviction of those guilty of the repugnant practices to which the bill is addressed and the interests of justice and protection of those who are unfairly or wrongly accused—the protection of the innocent. There was virtual unanimity of view among witnesses that the proper protections of persons accused of the offences to be constituted in the bill were not there. There was unanimity of view, except on one very small point, among committee members as to how those defects could be overcome. I commend the bill to the ministers for their very close consideration in the light of the committee report.

         One thing that we sometimes take for granted which we should not is our system of justice and also, to a certain extent, the standards in our society that have led us to appreciate the way in which people should be treated if they are accused of any particular crime or action in our society. We have developed a system of justice over many centuries and, by and large, it works quite well. In other regards, we have standards in our society which are relatively new. While some may seek to criticise the systems in other countries where life can be considerably cheaper, it was only a short while ago that child labour and slave labour existed in our country.

         I draw the attention of the House to paragraph 2.16 in the report regarding the protection of witnesses. I think the intent of this legislation is something that very few people in Australia and, indeed, other countries would find any argument with.

         My concern is that, should a case be brought before an Australian court, the Australian government and the prosecution have the responsibility of ensuring that a person, particularly a young child, is given the full and total protection using every resource possible and available to the Australian government. The last thing anyone would want to see is a prosecution against any person leading to any threat to a witness. We are all aware that in some countries big issues and lots of money are involved for the people involved in this trade, whether they be military, police or others. I fear very much that any child used as a witness in a case like this would be at serious risk.

It is relatively difficult even within the Australian context, where we have some control, to ensure the protection of witnesses, but a  child in such a high risk situation, as he or she would obviously be in this event, would be even further at risk. I would not want it on my head, and I do not think anyone else would, that a law, if it were not backed up by action on the ground, to protect a child witness or anyone else could be responsible for even greater physical harm than occurs to that witness at the moment.

There is also reference—I think it is recommendation 36—to the need for the ministers to consult with members of the New South Wales Bar Association and with senior counsel who have offered advice and tendered evidence to the committee and whose advice I believe would be helpful in the redraft of the legislation which this report recommends.

         On the detail of the report, there are three issues I want to raise. The first is that as one who has been involved, through my wife Rosemary Sinclair, with the prevention of child abuse in Australia I am very much in favour of the purport of this legislation, but I am also in favour of the videotaping of evidence of children. Chief magistrate Ron Cahill of the ACT initiated this form of taking evidence. For all that I recognise the difficulties involved, I believe it essential that in the nature and character of evidence being taken from abroad videotaping of the evidence of children be permitted in this legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second issue is that, nonetheless, I think we need to be aware of the onus of proof and of the absolute need for any type of legislation not to deprive an accused person of the rights of the presumption of innocence. I believe it is necessary to get a proper balance between those two. It is essential that there be capacity to take video evidence in this field.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third issue I wanted to touch on is my concern that in the nature of the report a number of errors have been apparent. One is the question of trying to determine the age of a child. It is absolutely essential that we do not leave the successful prosecution of an offence that takes place outside Australia to the determination of whether or not a child is under 10. That is an extraordinarily difficult decision to take. I note the reservations entered by my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) with respect to the whole question of the presumptions and the beliefs that an individual has, but at the same time—his reservations will have to be proved on the balance of probabilities—my concern is that it is important that there be a change in that age restraint. I am pleased to see that that has been recommended by the committee. I strongly recommend that to the government because I think it is a sensible and necessary amendment.

         There are a number of matters which relate to the extent to which there is a constitutional capacity of the Australian parliament to address this type of legislation. I am quite convinced that it can be undertaken under the external affairs power. For that reason I have no doubt regarding the validity of the legislation. For all I noticed that there was some evidence contrary to that, I believe that there is a constitutional power. I commend the report, I commend the committee and I trust that the government will introduce the amended legislation as expeditiously as possible.

         —by leave—In speaking in support of the advisory report of the Joint Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 I wish to draw attention to three very important provisions. The first is the recommendation to increase penalties for those who derive profit and financial benefit from child sex tourism to match the proposed penalties in the bill for those engaging in sex with children overseas. This is a very important provision because it proves to anyone suggesting that the committee's report waters down the provisions of the bill that they are dead wrong—dead-set and totally wrong. To increase the penalties for sex tourism operators and organisers effectively targets the best practical outcome from this legislation. The exploitation of children is bad enough, but tour organisers not only exploit children; they also exploit those who have a mental illness and who are disturbed enough to engage in these activities overseas. To exploit the exploiters, in my assessment, justifies a penalty equal to the 17 years' imprisonment proposed in the bill for those engaging in sex with children overseas. This recommendation in the report beefs up the most practical aspect and penalty that can apply to make sure that these activities are not coming out of Australia and engaged in by Australian citizens.

         I also draw the attention of the House to the important way in which the report places a better balance on community expectations that arise out of the legislation. On an emotional issue like this there is sometimes a problem. The public expectations will run way ahead and well beyond any practical capacity of any legislation to get the desired results. In many respects the number of successful prosecutions will depend on the resources provided to the Australian Federal Police and the prosecutors involved. But, most importantly, we should understand that the principle of deterrence underscores the legislation. This is also safety net legislation, not taking over the responsibilities of overseas parliaments to enact the correct legislation. I draw the attention of the House to an important part of the submission provided by the Attorney-General's Department that states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The philosophy underlying the proposed offence provisions is one of deterrence. The provisions are designed to act as a net to catch offenders who are found to have escaped the criminal justice system of the foreign country where the act has occurred. The primary responsibility for protecting children from sexual exploitation continues to rest, as it should, with the countries where the children are exploited.
       </para>
       <para>
        That very important part of the submission, reflected in the report, should be made known to those organisations that have high expectations about the outcomes that will arise from the legislation.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The quote from the submission of the Attorney-General's Department also makes mention of the great responsibilities of host nations. In this respect, once the bill is reintroduced and, I am sure, passed by both houses of parliament, the government has a responsibility to adopt a regional approach to this issue, not to sit back having passed our own legislation. In all bilateral discussions and international forums we should actively urge the nations involved to take the correct action in ratifying the convention on the rights of the child and to enact in their own parliaments all the necessary legislation needed to make sure that child sex tourism occurs nowhere in the east and south Asian and South Pacific regions.

         I draw the attention of the House to the fact that India, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have acceded to the convention on the rights of the child introduced by the United Nations in November 1989, but have not yet signed or ratified it. Malaysia has neither acceded to, signed nor ratified the convention. As our ministers visit these countries and engage in discussions they could do nothing better than to urge ratification of and compliance with that convention to make sure the regional approach produces effective legislation in Australia and effective outcomes in each of the host nations. I join with the other members of the committee in thanking the secretariat and the entire committee for their consideration and work. This is a report that, when adopted by the government and reintroduced into the House, will substantially improve the effectiveness and fairness of the legislation. I am sure it will be welcomed by all Australians who have a concern about this very important issue.

         —by leave—Today's debate on the study of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 marks an important innovation. This is the first time we have followed the practice, well tried in the Senate, of referring a bill to a standing committee of this chamber during its passage through the House. It is worthwhile noting the role that the former opposition spokesperson on legal affairs, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), and the current spokesperson, Senator Vanstone, played in the decision of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr).

         Members on this side of the House have often spoken about the need for time to adequately examine the implications of legislation. We are constantly warning the government of the unintended consequences of poorly considered and drafted legislation. I welcome the opportunity we have had to consider the legislation in more detail. It is a particularly positive step to be able to review this bill, especially given the issues and the sensitivities involved.

         As has been said by my friend the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the issue of prostitution is an emotive one. When it comes to child sex, the emotions are more extreme. Everyone regards paedophilia as repulsive. The notion of child sex tourism and the carefully considered exploitation and abuse that it involves is even more repugnant. When we are faced with legislation on a matter that incites these emotional extremes, it is important that we can examine it in a calm and reasonable way. The concerns that have been raised over this bill show just how important detailed review and consideration can be.

         It has been suggested that the bill reflects a tendency to subtly reshape our criminal justice system so that, in effect, presumption of innocence is replaced by presumption of guilt. The Queensland Law Society and the International Commission of Jurists have warned that special care must be taken to ensure that this law does not erode rights to a fair trial. Other witnesses have also echoed this view. There are fears that the many provisions of the legislation are short cuts to conviction, that the onus is on the accused to prove his or her innocence, and it has been suggested that these aspects of the bill could create opportunities for blackmail. As the report has said, it is vital that the bill uphold the legal protections afforded to accused persons which are at the heart of Australia's criminal justice system.

         There have been concerns over the costs involved in administering the bill. The Australian Federal Police Union told the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that it believed that any law could not be enforced without a substantial increase in resources. The costs of defending a charge brought under this bill are perhaps even more concerning.

         Many of us in this parliament are already concerned that too many Australians get the justice they can afford rather than the justice they deserve. The evidence the committee received suggested that actions brought under these proposals could cost up to $400,000 to defend, leading to forecasts of two classes of defendants—those who can buy a thorough defence and those who rely on video links. There are also concerns over how it will be possible to prevent overseas coercion and enforce the laws of perjury and the like against foreign nationals in foreign countries.

         Finally, it is important to reiterate the report's statement that the committee has worked to produce a widely acceptable, workable and effective bill, not to water down the legislation. Three ministers—the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice, and the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)—have already heavied the committee with a joint media release on the bill, despite the many concerns that have been expressed. It is worth noting—I remind the House that this is not the first time the Minister for Justice has failed to take the advice of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) on an important legal issue—that not so long ago, on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Bill, I had cause to talk to the Minister for Justice about his lack of support for the sensible views of the honourable member for Banks. It would be a great shame if ministerial standover merchants prevented further opportunities for further scrutiny of legislation when we have just learnt how it can improve such laws.

        The government does not accept this request for amendments, which would have the effect of virtually removing the assets test from Austudy. The amendment is totally extraneous to the subject matter of the bill which relates to matters such as better benefits control measures and a legislative basis for Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme. The opposition claims to support these measures but it is apparently prepared to put them at risk by introducing an additional provision which it knows must be unacceptable to the government.

         The matter of the health care card provision has already been extensively aired in both chambers. The brief history of this matter is that an error in publicity material led some students to obtain Austudy on the strength of their parents or spouses holding a health care card, without the application of an assets test. Staff in the department's student assistance centres have been advised of this and the affected clients are being contacted by mail.

         Eligible students whose parents have a health care card will be able to receive Austudy until their parents' current card expires. Then payment will stop only where family assets exceed the Austudy limits. This should ensure that students whose parents have health care cards are treated equitably. The Attorney-General's Department is being instructed to draft an amendment to the Austudy regulations to ensure that students who are paid Austudy because a parent or spouse holds a health care card and who subsequently lose their entitlement when an assets test is applied will not have an overpayment raised against them.

         On the question of students receiving benefits contrary to the Austudy legislation, legal advice has been given by the Attorney-General's Department that payments made on the strength of a health care card have not been contrary to the Austudy legislation. There is no evidence that any significant numbers of families were expecting to receive benefits and have been disadvantaged. Only a handful of families who received Austudy initially because of holding a health care card have so far had to be reassessed, on expiry of the card, because of assets. I remind the House that these are families whose assets generally have a net market value in excess of $700,000.

         However, now that the government has contrived to give the matter a great deal of publicity, if it were to agree to waive the assets test for health care card holders it could be expected that many asset rich but income poor persons, not necessarily primary producers but other business people with successful tax minimisation strategies, would obtain a health care card for the sole purpose of qualifying for student assistance payments. The cost could be in excess of $10 million a year. For that reason, the government will not agree to the Senate's amendments.

         Following last year's budget, in fact, in September of last year, a press release from the Department of Employment, Education and Training stated:

        Effective January 1, 1994 students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived.

       </para>
       <para>
        That statement was then followed up in a series of publications from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the most notable of which was the official Austudy 1994 guide,
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         A guide to parent finance
        </emphasis>
        , which is published jointly by the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Union of Students. In numerous places in this guide—and this goes to the students who are or may think they are eligible for student assistance under the Austudy scheme and their parents—is a statement such as this one:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        One could read on in other places throughout this guide. Quite clearly it is stated as official departmental policy that, if a health care card is held, the assets test which normally applies to the families of students in the situation applying for Austudy would be waived. It is that stated commitment, made in no less than five separate documents, on five separate occasions that I am aware of that we seek to hold the government to in relation to these particular amendments which were moved in the Senate. As I indicated when this bill was in the House previously, I was looking at the possibility of whether it was technically possible for these amendments to be drafted and incorporated as part of this bill. The advice was that that could be done and, therefore, the amendments were moved.

For the government simply to say, as it does here again on this occasion, that it cannot afford to honour these commitments or somehow that it will lead to more people making use of this particular provision than would otherwise make use of it is simply to ignore the fact that, in the first place, it was its stated commitment that was repeated on numerous occasions to students that led to this situation coming about.

We were told in one estimates committee that only 100 people would be involved, and the minister has said again today that there is no evidence of any large numbers that would be involved.

        That organisation points out there that we simply do not know what the numbers are. If people are told that there is a provision which is not open to them, then they will not bother to apply in the first place. Therefore, to say that we have any idea of the numbers involved is simply nonsense.

         The minister made some comments about the fact that no overpayment notices will be made where these payments have been provided and that parents of students, where the health care card was in existence and they applied for and were granted Austudy, will be able to continue to receive Austudy until the card expires. That can create the iniquitous situation for some students whereby, if a health care card expires after a period of six months and that six months just happens to be during their educational year, they could find themselves, having made provisions or arrangements for their education, in the position where some time during that course or that year those arrangements no longer obtain and, therefore, they have to face a wholly different financial situation. If the minister had said that those students could retain Austudy at least for the period of 12 months for which they had made some arrangements in relation to their education, then it would have been a much fairer system than he has indicated will exist under the provisions which he is indicating will apply should this amendment not be passed.

         But it does not deal with the exact problem in hand. We have students, particularly in rural areas of Australia, whose educational opportunities are clearly fewer than those in other parts of the nation. For example, the rural communities in Victoria issued a report,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Austudy rural inequities
         </emphasis>
         , in which they pointed out that many families in rural areas of Australia have not the same educational opportunities as do their cousins in the urban and city areas of Australia. They give examples, which I will not go into tonight, of three families. Even though the families would be regarded as being in a poor situation financially, because of the operation of the income and assets tests, those children generally do not have the same opportunities.

         Then we have reports going back to July last year. For example, there is
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Rural education crisis
         </emphasis>
         , which shows the percentage of total population participating in tertiary studies in different regions of Victoria. In the inner Melbourne metropolitan region it is 6.9 per cent and in the metropolitan region it is 4.4 per cent. But, when we go out to the rural areas of Victoria, in north-eastern Victoria it is 2.3 per cent; in the north Mallee, 2.4 per cent; in east Gippsland, 2.6 per cent; in the Wimmera, 2.7 per cent; in the Goulburn Valley, 2.7 per cent. The Victorian country average is only three per cent compared to an average of 4.4 per cent in the metropolitan areas. Again this quite clearly indicates the inequality in terms of access to education of students in rural areas of Australia.

         The 1991 report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training reported that non-metropolitan young adults are participating in higher education at one-half the rate of their metropolitan counterparts. One could adduce more evidence from the fact that it is quite clear that the opportunities for rural students to participate in tertiary and higher education, in many cases because of financial constraints, are simply not the same as they are for their rural counterparts.

         The minister may say that is an issue that ought to be addressed in other ways and that there ought to be programs in existence to ensure that that is the case. But we are saying here, quite clearly, that this is a case where there can be no question at all that there was a stated commitment—a commitment made by the department in a press release; a commitment made by the department in terms of the official publication which went to thousands upon thousands of students and their families throughout Australia; a commitment made in the application form for Austudy which, when we clearly read it, indicates that the health care card will lead to the waiving of the assets test; and in other documentation. We are simply saying here that, having made a commitment to the students of Australia and their parents, this government ought to honour that commitment and honour it in a way which is fully in line with what it said at the time.

         It is interesting, perhaps ironical, that when this matter was raised in, I think, February of this year the first response by a spokesman for the minister was that the government will attempt to honour its commitment, suggesting that it knew that it was a commitment that it had made and it was not merely, as the minister has pointed out again today, an error made by some unknown bureaucrat in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Whether or not it was, the responsibility rests with the government because it has said quite clearly in a whole series of documents that this would be provided. It was welcomed at the time and, having been welcomed, we believe the government ought to stand by its commitment.

         —When speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994 I think we have to take into account the white paper initiatives that are incorporated in the budget because it is a package that has tackled the most important problem facing this nation today—that is, unemployment. This package not only establishes the economic fundamentals that will set Australia on the course of continued low inflationary growth but also delivers real, immediate benefits to the people on the ground.

         The budget contains many innovative programs, but perhaps more importantly it contains vision—vision of an Australia with a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000 and vision of an Australia where the long-term unemployed are assisted back into the work force. Of course, the opposition has been quite confused about this over the past few weeks. On the one hand, the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), told the House that the government has run up the white flag of surrender on full employment by aiming for an unemployment rate of some five per cent while, on the other hand, he said that five per cent unemployment is unattainable and should not even be aimed for.

But I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your consideration and for bringing them back to order. As I was saying, my electorate has an unemployment rate of some 24.7 per cent, while 54.4 per cent of those unemployed people in my electorate have been out of work for more than 12 months. That compares with the national average of 45 per cent. I can assure the House that I have seen first-hand the misery that has been caused by long-term unemployment.

         The social costs of the long-term unemployed are obvious. Not only do we get income from our jobs, but also we get our feeling of worth, our day-to-day reason for existence, from employment. The Australian economy is also missing out on the many years of experience that these people could bring to industry. All honourable members, I believe, would have heard stories about long-term unemployed people who are well qualified for jobs they are applying for but are overlooked because many employers feel that, because they have been unemployed for a long period of time, there must be something wrong with them. The job compact is a way to reintroduce the long-term unemployed to the work force. This is a very worthwhile and vital role for an effective government in the 1990s.

         By instituting the job compact the government is sending an important message—that employment in modern Australia is a right. It is a message that is fundamental to any social democracy. This government has really met objectives in delivering the goods for the long-term unemployed. I was very pleased to read an article by Geoff Kitney in the

         The introduction of individual case management is an important initiative. Unemployed people could not be blamed for sometimes thinking that they are just another statistic. It will be an enormous help for these people to have one contact, with the CES or other employment agency, which knows their case, who cares about them and who particularly takes on board the best way in which to assist them back into the work force. With the establishment of case management this will now be the reality of many clients who are presently registered with the CES. Those who are involved in the job compact, those in the youth training initiative, or those who are regarded as a high risk of becoming long-term unemployed will have an individual plan of assistance drawn up for them and will have their progress monitored by an individual officer.

         I was particularly pleased to see that the government has set the target of some 50,000 new apprenticeships and traineeship places by the year 1995-96. History has shown that an economic downturn does have severe effects on apprenticeships. The Carmichael report noted that it took until 1986-87 for apprenticeships to recover to their pre-1981 recession levels. That is why I was particularly pleased to see that the government is promoting the extra apprenticeship and traineeship places. Even though industry may be reducing places on the ground because of incapacity to pay, the economy would be suffering from a very serious skills shortage for years to come if apprenticeships were not increased.

         The extra places will be created, I am pleased to say, in a number of ways. Employers will be given more incentive to take on those apprentices and trainees. Employer payments will be increased from their current levels to make it more worth while for employers to take on apprentices. In addition, the government will provide increased funding of $1.1 billion over a four-year period, 1993-97, to increase the number of TAFE places that are provided.

         A large number of apprentices are employees of state governments, and state governments must seriously consider the human ramifications of cuts in apprenticeships. I would ask them to consider entering into the spirit of the Commonwealth's initiatives in promoting extra places for our young people. Other initiatives will see the jobsearch allowance for people under 18 replaced with the youth training allowance. The youth training allowance will be paid when the individual is undertaking training as well as looking for work.

         A whole range of economic and social factors have led to a reduction in the demand for unskilled workers. The shift away from the primary and manufacturing sectors towards the service sector means that employers are demanding young workers with some training in the service industry. In addition, the advent of new technology means that the entry level jobs that used to be taken up by our young people are now very much different. The fax machine, for example, has certainly made the messenger boy redundant.

         The simple fact is that changes in the world economy mean that people entering the work force for the very first time must be well trained if they are to have a chance. The youth training initiatives give them that chance. The national training wage will also greatly encourage employers to hire more workers as well as contributing to making Australia one of the most skilled nations in the world.

         Economic analysts show that employers will not hire more staff just because wages come down. But, with the training wage initiative, employers not only have reduced the cost of hiring but also know that they will have a better trained work force and the benefits that flow on from improved training. The ACTU and many employer groups have endorsed the national training wage.

         Honourable members will understand my intense interest in this subject when I share with them the following quote from a brief on unemployment in my electorate that came from a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon). It says:

        The Fairfield region has felt the greatest impact of retrenchment from the manufacturing and construction industries in the south west Sydney area. The group which has been most affected by these retrenchments is the unskilled labourers who are likely to face difficulties in the economic upturn when competing for jobs amongst job seekers who have better skills.
       </para>
       <para>
        I applaud any initiative which assists relatively unskilled people back into the work force. I particularly congratulate all ministers who were involved with and responsible for this package. As mentioned in the budget, there are a number of changes to the actual social security system as we know it. I have always believed that the welfare system, no matter how good it is, must change to meet the changing times and we also must recognise if there are anomalies within it and take action to correct them. However, changes to social security recently announced by the government represent a very significant improvement to the system. A new situation calls for a new policy. We all know that the labour market has gone through enormous changes since the social security system was founded, and it is only natural that the system should be reshaped to suit the new situation.

         We all know that part-time jobs are increasingly popular both amongst employers and prospective employees. It is also an undeniable fact that many people take on part-time or casual work as they wait for full-time work. The recently announced changes, I am pleased to say, recognise this reality and have made it financially worth while for unemployed people to accept part-time work. The new parenting allowance to be introduced from July 1995 is a very innovative and worthwhile initiative. The parenting allowance will reintroduce an element of choice for many families, allowing one parent to stay at home and care for the children. One parent will receive the parenting allowance free of any obligation to seek work. The payment will be available to low income families and families where one of the partners is unemployed.

         The parenting allowance will have a particularly large impact on my electorate of Prospect. One-third of the residents of the city of Fairfield, which covers most of my electorate, are younger than 18. The female labour force participation rate in Fairfield is 58.4 per cent, and the state average is 64.8 per cent. It is obvious that the parenting allowance will benefit my electorate of Prospect greatly because the high percentage of parents who are already staying at home to care for their children will gain that extra benefit.

         More evidence of the positive effect that the parenting allowance will have on families within my electorate can be obtained from figures on family income. As the publication
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Families in Fairfield

         by the Ettinger House Fairfield Family Resource Centre pointed out, 16.9 per cent of two-parent families with one dependant in Fairfield earn between $12,000 and $20,000 a year. The corresponding average for New South Wales is only 11.5 per cent, so any proposal to assist low income families with one parent staying at home is great news for my people. In this the International Year of the Family, what better initiative could there be? It is a very practical and valuable effort which shows that our government's commitment to the family is greater than mere words.

         Another initiative in the budget that I am sure all honourable members will join me in welcoming is, of course, the recognition of Australia's World War II mariners. I know of many people within my electorate who served in an indirect capacity in World War II, whether it was as a merchant mariner, a member of the Women's Land Army, or even as someone who took an active part in the defence of Darwin. The simple fact is that World War II was a time when the efforts of every single individual were required to be maximised to ensure our survival as a nation and the survival of our freedom. Not everyone could be directly involved in the so-called war action, but all the people who contributed their efforts in World War II were heroes. They were nothing less than heroes, and they deserve our continuing thanks and support. The budget announcement that World War II merchant mariners would be covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act is a very practical way of showing them our thanks for what they have done.

         I was also delighted that more funds have been allocated for the fight against breast cancer. It is, of course, an insidious disease that spreads through every part of Australian society. It is a disease that every woman in Australia is at risk of contracting. One in 16 Australian women will contract breast cancer during her lifetime. There are 5,000 new cases detected every year and 2,000 Australian women die of this disease each year. I refuse to accept that these deaths cannot be prevented. The allocation for breast cancer screening has been increased by $14 million in the 1994-95 budget, bringing the total funding to $41.8 million.

         One thing I do regret, however, is that this issue has to be, to a certain extent, and has become, a political football between state and federal governments. An issue such as this should be above politics. I was glad to see the Premier of New South Wales welcome the increased allocation in the budget by our government for breast cancer.

         Another major initiative in the health field which received a substantial allocation in this budget is the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect. Twelve million dollars have been allocated to this program over four years. For too long child abuse has been treated with ad hoc programs which do not have prevention as their major aim. Child abuse is one of the major problems facing this country. There are 50,000 reported cases of suspected child abuse every year. The government must continue to do everything in its power to protect the most helpless members of our society, our children.

         Furthermore, it is obvious that child abuse has ramifications for the individuals involved and for society for years to come. Drug abuse, homelessness, juvenile crime and mental illness are all partially caused and connected to child abuse. I sincerely hope that this program can assist in the drive to reduce Australia's depressingly high rate of youth suicide. I am glad to see that the strategy is the result of cooperation between non-government agencies and all three levels of government. It will require all energies to be harnessed in an effective way to overcome this problem.

         This budget takes on tough issues—issues like long-term unemployment and child abuse. This budget ensures that the recovery will be shared between all of us. The 1994 budget is an imaginative budget, in contrast to what the opposition would have given us. The government had the imagination and ability to deliver the compact which will ease the long-term unemployed back into the work force. The government has delivered a training wage which reduces cost and improves the skills base of our work force. It provides young people with programs to improve training.

         —ATSIC is a much maligned body. It has become a punching bag for almost every problem in indigenous affairs. ATSIC has been operational for only four years, so we can scarcely expect it to have solved the problems two centuries of European settlement has created. Unfortunately, it makes for an easy target by its very nature, the real failure in indigenous affairs and the lack of coordination between different levels of government, agencies and individuals.

         As the Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Standing Committee today said, `The infrastructure responsibilities of the Commonwealth, the states, territories and local government are unclear.' The standing committee believes that ATSIC is funding services that should be provided by other levels of government and once again wants to see action taken to stop this waste of resources. However, the committee is divided over the level of accountability of the use of resources by regional councils.

         The Australian National Audit Office has recommended that ATSIC encourage regional councils to document reasons for funding. It has been claimed by government members of the committee that this would impose bureaucratic accountability for political decisions that regional councils have been elected to make. Further, the majority of the committee reports that the ANAO has sought to establish itself as an arbiter of the appropriateness of regional council decisions, imposing conditions on political decisions not applied to any other level of government.

         The coalition members of the committee agree that the ANAO has no right to review the spending priorities selected by regional councils. However, we believe the decision making process over the allocation of funds should be more open. Question marks have been raised over the effectiveness of regional councils in getting money to the areas of real need in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.

         There are claims that funds are sometimes allocated on the basis of nepotism. Having to give reasons for funding decisions when they deviate from the regional plan will ensure that the regional councils cannot be properly criticised unless there is a good reason to do so. So it is in the regional council's interest to give reasons for funding decisions. Apart from anything else, it is commonsense when dealing with public money to give reasons why programs have been funded. Although this is not relevant to the report, if the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) had been required to give reasons for funding, she would still be a minister today.

         Serious allegations have been made over ATSIC's spending. In one case, it has been claimed that ATSIC funds were used by the Anyinginyi Aboriginal Health Congress in Tennant Creek to provide bogus salary payments to non-existent staff and on personal expenditure covering everything from furniture to meals.

         There have already been claims that the government has lost confidence in ATSIC and that it prefers to work through the Office of Indigenous Affairs in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) says, the Daffen report endorsed the coalition's policy at the last election. Perhaps the minister will recognise that in due course. ATSIC is doing important work but, if it is to remain credible, accountability at all levels remains vital.

          —I would like to take this opportunity to add to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the former Leader of the Opposition on 12 May in congratulating and paying tribute to the former Australian cricket captain, Allan Border. The statistics on Allan Border do not need repeating, apart from the fact that he is the highest test run scorer, with 11,174 runs. He also played the most test matches, 156, and played the most as captain. I think the most remarkable statistic amongst all that is that, despite playing so many test matches, he still had a test batting average of over 50, which is in itself remarkable.

          I think the most distinctive and memorable characteristic of Allan Border was his fighting qualities—his ability to go out under adversity and rescue Australia so many times when the team was in trouble. Basically, his fighting, gutsy qualities really make him the personification of the little Aussie battler. I think it is those qualities and the way that they were shown so many times on the test cricket field that people will most remember about Allan Border.

          I have an additional memory of Allan Border. I can recall in January 1971 playing a game against him. It was one of his very first matches for the Mosman cricket club in Sydney. I was a youngster playing for the northern district club. I recall opening the bowling and taking the first wicket. Then this very short, little left-hander came in to bat at No. 3 and I thought, `You beauty, I will knock this bloke over. He does not look like too much of a problem.' I nearly did, too. The first ball or two nearly got through.

          I am afraid to say that after that he treated my bowling in much the same way as he has treated most other bowlers around the world. He gave me a bit of a touch up and I was banished to the deep backward square leg boundary. Unfortunately, on this particular ground there was a very short boundary and a leg spinner came on to bowl and kept dropping the ball short. This little left-hander named A. Border kept bashing the ball straight at me. Those who have ever fielded behind square leg in a cricket match will know that if the ball bounces in front of a person it usually spins past into the fence. That is exactly what happened to me. The only saving grace for me that day was that my team won the game, despite Allan Border scoring 50-odd runs.

I can recall at an early season training session being asked to go and bowl to this new player—also a left-hander, of course—in the nets. I went over and bowled a few overs to him and he looked pretty good as well. Of course, I would say that is proved.

He made a great contribution, always bringing the debate out of the airy-fairy and back to the world in which we as Australians live. As Minister for the Army, as a devoted father to his children, and as one of the founders of the Liberal Party he made a great contribution to the development of our nation. He was really a great Australian, and on behalf of Rosemary and myself I extend our sympathy to his children and join in the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) earlier today.

We need to find adequate ways of ensuring that all the different family groupings can be properly and securely housed with access to transport and employment.

         Briefly, I would like to bring to the attention of the House some exciting developments in relation to CQU's two campuses in the Hinkler electorate, with the opening of facilities at both Bundaberg and Gladstone in the near future. This week, after five years of temporary accommodation, the first classes will be held in Bundaberg's new $2.5 million campus, although the complex will not be opened until 22 July.

         New facilities, such as a 200-seat lecture theatre, air-conditioned tutorial rooms, specific teaching laboratories and extensive landscaping add a new dimension to tertiary education in Bundaberg. The Bundaberg campus currently caters for 150 full-time students, with others in part-time and external studies offering first-year degree courses in arts, business and education, and soon information technology. Students may then complete their remaining two years at the main campus in Rockhampton or elsewhere.

         Similarly, Gladstone, with a student body of 600—110 full-time, 70 part-time and 420 external—is undergoing expansion in both physical and academic senses. The new campus, set spectacularly on the Gladstone Marina, becomes operational this Friday, 3 June, and takes its first undergraduates next month. In line with Gladstone's strong industrial base, the local campus has a focus on engineering, technology and environmental management.

         The federal government has provided $3 million for a new engineering complex which should commence construction around August or September. As well, the government has agreed to build a second engineering building. Together, they will enable Gladstone campus to offer both maintenance and process engineering experiences. I commend the government on these initiatives and trust the commitments it has given to Gladstone and the university will all be honoured. Currently, Gladstone offers first-year degree courses in engineering and information technology, as well as arts, business and education. It also has a course of associate diploma in electrical engineering, vital to Gladstone's expansion.

          —I want to speak on a few subjects tonight. During the recess, forwarded to my parliamentary office was a document called `From the Privacy Act: Personal Information Digest from the Human Rights Australia Privacy Commissioner'. It is significant that this digest is over 450 pages in length. When we are talking about privacy, it is rather revealing to understand how many people have access to other people's records. The Privacy Commissioner is there to ensure that this information is kept private, within those acts. I was rather surprised today to coincidentally receive a letter from a group of constituents, a firm of chartered accountants, who said:

A person of less integrity might just have cashed it. The address for the service of the particular notice was that of the tax agent concerned, so there must have been a link-up between the tax office and the computers of this program of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education unit.

          It is a matter of grave concern when we are assured by the Privacy Commissioner in sending out this booklet that this type of thing would not happen. It is not the first time this has happened. I recently had cause for some concern about the Taxation Office when a constituent received somebody else's information. That other person obviously received the first person's information. I believe it requires more than a digest of what can happen and who has access, to make sure that the privacy of every Australian, particularly of our taxation records, is kept in the manner it should be.

          It is not in connection with trying to blow the trumpet of the maroons that I want to speak, although as a Queenslander I thought it was a fine spectacle, particularly the last five minutes, when the Queensland team showed its depth and determination and won the game. Probably the most exciting was the last play and the nine passes that took the game from about three-quarters of the field from one side to the other and provided that touchdown.

          I have heard the comment from many a New South Welshman that if it were not for the two forward passes and the double movement, as they then suggested it was, maybe we would not have got away with it. I take their minds back to last year's episode, when a try similarly scored by Queensland was disallowed. So the fate of the game depends very much on fate itself.

          The game was significant for a couple of reasons. First of all, nobody in the papers has commented on the fact that there were no brawls within that game. That would be the first time I have seen such a State of Origin. People have commented in connection with the refereeing decisions. I saw some bad decisions made. But people forget that the wisdom they get by being able to stop the camera and see a person onside or offside or a phase of play is not available to either the linesman or the referee at that time. It is a split second decision.

I think Mal Meninga and Laurie Daley are two of the finest sportsmen around. We heard about Allan Border earlier tonight, but I give credit to those two fine sportsmen, as well as to the stage of play, the linesman and the referee.

         The anticipated growth in air traffic of at least six per cent in Sydney for the next few years and the spectre of privatisation of airports mean that the problems of safety will move to unimagined levels of complexity. The rhetoric of the generally excellent record of Australian air safety ignores the benefits of relatively uncluttered skies and good weather rather than outstanding management or sound government policy. Given the controversial nature of air safety and issues such as Badgerys Creek and the third runway at Sydney, the rhetoric of public and parliamentary debate is often extreme.

         It was unfortunate that in debating the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 the contributions of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) contained a number of incorrect, superficial and highly damaging personal accusations. In relation to the DC3 crash, the honourable member for Fadden repeated incorrect press statements that `no air safety regulations governed the operation of that particular DC3's flight'. This was quite wrong. There are many regulations applicable. With the Bureau of Air Safety and the Civil Aviation Authority currently investigating, it is irresponsible to prejudge and raise public alarm based on superficial press comment.

         Statements such as `aircraft flying over water should be within a one-hour range of alternative landing' are again superficial and wrong. The suggestions by the honourable member for Fadden that nothing is being done about aviation administration and that the CAA is to blame are highly destructive. Many external and internal reviews have been and are taking place, including those by the Safety Forum, Mr Terrell, Sypher Meuller, Dr Ratner, and Coopers and Lybrand.

         While I can understand the feelings of the honourable member for Hume on this subject, his naming of CAA officers such as the South-East Regional Flying Operations Manager, Mr Baston, and Mary O'Brien was unnecessary and an abuse of parliamentary privilege. Mr Baston, in particular, has a proud and successful 40-year career in the aviation industry, including 18 years in the RAAF. Mary O'Brien has been involved for 30 years.

         We should be particularly careful in reflecting on the professional reputations of individuals. Contrary to the allegations of the honourable member for Hume, a great deal of action took place with regard to Monarch Air and prejudging the outcomes of investigations by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Coronial inquiry has no public benefit. Again, allegations that an airworthiness inspector who recommended grounding Western Airlines in Wagga Wagga in 1993 was sidelined for this action are, I am informed, incorrect. These accusations should be referred to the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots and the Regional Airlines Association to establish the facts.

         The naming of people in parliament and media trials are no way to address flight safety issues, particularly when the due process of the correct forums is proceeding. I have no brief for the CAA but, while it is responsible for enforcing regulations, these regulations and policies are set by governments. In addition, the CAA does not service or fly planes. If it grounded every aircraft for breach or suspicion of breach of regulations, then every airline in Australia would stop. No doubt dozens of members would be on their feet emoting outrage at the bureaucratic frustration of commercial operations. There is no question that, as the honourable member for Hume stated, the financial status of operators is a major factor in maintenance, manning and safety, but his suggestion that the CAA should take this into consideration is misplaced, when regulations clearly prevent such action.

         Equally, it is outrageous that successive governments have refused to take effective actions concerning airline insurance. The anger and frustration of CAA personnel must be understood at the unsubstantiated comments of members implying corruption and incompetence, when the air safety budget has been cut by close to 50 per cent. The safety division has seen a reduction from 700 to 500 staff in the last two years.

         There is no question that, given safety funding cuts, deregulation, privatisation, the growth of air traffic and the inevitable problems ensured by the intensification of air traffic in Sydney with runways carefully aligned with a major oil refinery and the densest population in Australia, a major review of air safety is required. This needs a royal commission or at least a specific parliamentary inquiry, not just parliamentary rhetoric.

        (2)(a)-(b) With respect to the 1992/93 income year, a person with an accumulated HECS debt and a taxable income of less than $27 748 would not be required to make a repayment for that year, while a person with an accumulated HECS debt of at least $560 and a taxable income of $28 000 would be required to make a repayment of $560 towards the HECS debt as part of the person's income tax assessment.

        (2)(b)(i) The deferred option of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme ensures that people with an accumulated HECS debt are not required to repay any part of their HECS Debt until they can afford to do so. Ability to repay is measured by taxable income. While the person whose taxable income is below the threshold does not have to make a repayment, the person's HECS debt remains to be repaid in future years and is indexed to movements in the consumer price index to maintain its real value.

        Australia Post employs some 32,000 people full-time, and 4,000 part time. Recruitment within the Corporation is generally decentralised to the regional or facility level and no centralised personnel/consultant records are maintained, either nationally or on a State basis.

        Recruitment within Australia Post is largely decentralised and the Corporation does not maintain a centralised reporting system that would allow it to identify whether there are former employees re-employed as consultants or on contract. It might be noted, however, that as a matter of corporate policy Australia Post does not re-employ people who have previously accepted voluntary early retirement packages from the Corporation.

        Telstra does not maintain a centralised reporting system that would allow it to identify whether there are former employees re-employed as consultants or on contract. It is of note that Telstra has a policy that severely restricts employees who have been made redundant from being reemployed by Telstra in the same or like capacity for a period of 24 months, including reemployment with an agency/consultancy under contract to Telstra.

        (a) In August 1991 the Australia Abroad Council asked the Embassy in Tokyo to examine the feasibility of conducting a major promotion in Japan and to recommend a strategy for an event best suited to Japan. This was undertaken by the Ambassador and a group of senior officers in the Tokyo Embassy, in consultation with the Embassy's Information Coordination Committee, consisting of representatives of Australian agencies and corporations in Japan and State Government representatives. A detailed strategy for a major promotion in Japan in November 1993 was prepared by the Embassy in December 1991.

        (9) Celebrate Australia, as was widely reported, consisted of 100 major events in 33 centres around Japan. As listed in the official program, component events came under the broad headings of business, visual arts, performing arts, education and technology, entertainment and sport and people-to-people exchanges. In addition, I am advised that the publicity momentum achieved in Japan by the organisers of Celebrate Australia resulted in scores of smaller events organised spontaneously at the local level during November 1993, often by Australian expatriates, such as teachers, and in several cases with financial backing of local government and local business.

        (10) The exact amounts expended for Celebrate Australia by the different Commonwealth departments and agencies is set out in the answer to question 5 (a) above. I am advised that additional amounts expended on individual events by other companies and organisations ranged greatly, from just a few thousand dollars to several millions. Many events were organised by the Japanese side with various parties, such as sponsors, promoters and importers, contributing in cash or kind. Those costs are not known.

The Embassy in Tokyo holds a publicity log compiled before, during and after Celebrate Australia which records more than 370 separate items of Japanese print and electronic media coverage of Celebrate Australia. The Australian Ballet itself received excellent reviews in all of Japan's major daily newspapers and in a wide range of high-quality specialist magazines. The most noteworthy of these reviews were in Japan's three largest national daily newspapers:

The CAMU had overall responsibility for the running of Celebrate Australia, though it did not directly select performers. This was done, in some cases, by Japanese promoters and, in others, by individual event organisers and promoters in consultation with Australian booking agencies.

        (1) The Australian Government has a long-term commitment to a position of opposition to all whaling and to seeking a ban on all commercial whaling, while recognising that some traditional communities continue to require access to whaling and whale products to meet traditional cultural and subsistence needs. With bipartisan support, the Government has continued to support the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and its scientific committee as the appropriate international organisation through which to pursue conservation of all species of whales, dolphins and porpoises. The Australian representatives to the IWC have been instrumental in achieving support for all of the major conservation decisions taken by the Commission in recent years. We will continue that active pursuit of the Government's objectives.

        (2) The recent IWC meeting was not a conference to discuss the resumption of commercial whaling. It was an intersessional technical meeting of an IWC working group to discuss the proposed sanctuary in the Southern Ocean. It was held on Norfolk Island from 20-24 February 1994 at the invitation of this Government, to ensure continued action on the sanctuary initiative. The working group's task was to examine a number of outstanding legal, political, geographic and ecological issues relating to establishment of a sanctuary in the Southern Ocean and to prepare a report and recommendations for consideration at the 46th Annual Meeting of the IWC, which will be held in Mexico in May this year.

        Australia was represented at the meeting on Norfolk Island by the Australian Commissioner to the IWC and a delegation of six, including two representatives of national non-government conservation groups. Delegates of the twenty-six IWC member countries attending were welcomed on behalf of the Government, by the Hon Janice Crosio MP, representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and by the President of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly on behalf of that body and the Norfolk Island community. In Mrs Crosio's welcome, the Government's continued opposition to the resumption of commercial whaling was made clear, as was its strong support for implementation of a sanctuary in the Southern Ocean.

        From the perspective of the Australian Government and other participants the working group meeting went well, with the support provided by the Norfolk Island government and community playing an important part in establishing an atmosphere in which constructive discussion was possible. The broad agreement reached by the working group that there are no irreconcilable difficulties remaining in the establishment of a sanctuary under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling was a particularly significant step.

       Dear Mr Costello
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I refer to your letter of 14 February 1994 in which you reaffirmed your request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) 1982 to access to all documents held by this Department relating to the Community, Cultural, Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Your initial request of 1 December 1993 was in relation to all documents relating to both the Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program and the Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program and it will be assumed, unless you advise otherwise, that your request relates to both programs.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       With the commencement of the investigation of your request it was realised that besides documents in the Defence and Industry Division and Resource Management Improvement Branch, there are also documents in the Expenditure Policy Branch. To locate, examine and make a decision on the documents that exist in the Expenditure Policy Branch of this Department would involve a substantial and unreasonable diversion of resources. In effect it is estimated that some 140 hours of work would be necessary to locate the potentially very few relevant documents on some 160 files covering a period of five years. Because of the demands placed on the Expenditure Policy Branch in particular in the coordination of the Budget, it would be unreasonable to expect their resources to be diverted to the FOI request.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Because of the nature of the work of the Expenditure Policy Branch, the documents would largely be cabinet documents in which there was a reference to this program in the context of a new expenditure or savings proposal. This information would be in documents already on files in the Defence and Industry Division, in respect of which Mr Winder would be making a decision under the Act, and in any event would be highly likely to be exempt under Section 34 of the FOI Act because of Cabinet confidentiality.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       As indicated in the telephone discussion of 7 March between Mr Winder, First Assistant Secretary, Defence and Industry Division and Mr Davey, your Economic Adviser, because of the abovementioned problems involved in the inclusion of the documents in Expenditure Policy Branch in your request, it is necessary to refuse access under Section 24(1) of the FOI Act. It is therefore requested that you contact Mr Winder (ph. 2633454) with a view to making the request in a form that would remove the grounds for refusal (Section 24(6)(c) of the FOI Act refers). In accordance with Section 24(7) of the Act, the period commencing on the day you are given this notice concerning the intention of refusal and ending on the day you confirm or alter the request following consultation is disregarded in the computation of the 30 day statutory period for notification of a decision.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In accordance with departmental guidelines and the guidelines set down in the Attorney General's Department revised FOI memorandum No 29 of 4 November 1992, your request for remission of the fees and charges was referred to the Minister for Finance for consideration.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Minister subsequently determined that, taking into account the provisions of Section 29 of the Act, the matters listed in the aforementioned memorandum, and the contents of your letters of 1 December 1993 and 24 February 1994, remission of the charges was not warranted.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The decision was based on the fact that the documents held in Finance relate almost entirely to administrative arrangements, in particular in respect of the annual appropriation for the program. Other documents relate to this Department's view of the adequacy of the methodology of the evaluation program. There are also documents belonging to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories which are the subject of your FOI request to that Department.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       It was considered that making the content of the documents held by Finance more widely available would not contribute valuable material to the public debate and therefore not be in the public interest. It was also considered that the documents have little or no bearing on the central context of the debate on the administration of the grants process.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Attorney General's guidelines indicate that consideration should be given to remission of fees and charges where the information is of a kind that would customarily be provided in an answer to a Parliamentary Question or if the information contained in a document would normally be provided to a Member of Parliament in accordance with the "Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters". It is not considered that the information falls into either of these categories.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       You should note that the Minister's decision to refuse to remit the charges is not subject to internal review. In accordance with Section 55 of the Act you may however apply within 60 days to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal for a review of the decision that you are liable to pay a charge.
