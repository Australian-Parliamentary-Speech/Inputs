        The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is major structural reform of the way in which this country presents and runs its fiscal policy. The bill fulfils an election promise by this government to make sure that the Australian accounts are presented in a fair and honest manner and to enshrine in legislation a requirement which will govern our government and any future government as to the way in which it will present and improve its financial performance. This is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will be a permanent feature, making sure that Australia's economic policy is run better, making sure that the public is kept better informed, making sure that there is transparency in economic policy in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The need for improved fiscal outcomes in Australia is clearly demonstrated by the persistence of Commonwealth deficits over the past 25 years, the ratcheting up of Commonwealth general government net debt and falling levels of national saving. Commonwealth general government net debt has increased from around 2.5 per cent of GDP in June 1972 to around 19.2 per cent of GDP currently. Over the past five years, there has been a greater than fivefold increase in Commonwealth general government net debt, which now stands at $93 billion. By this measure alone, there is clearly a need for governments to improve fiscal outcomes.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The argument that somehow it is compassionate for governments to spend money they do not have is quite fallacious. Spending money the government does not have is merely racking up debts for future generations and making their lives harder rather than easier. General, continuing deficit spending is selfishness by one generation against the next.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill will rectify this situation by implementing institutional arrangements to improve the formulation and reporting of fiscal policy. The need for such arrangements has already been supported by independent bodies such as the National Commission of Audit and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and the framework contained in this bill incorporates many of their recommendations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The improvement of the fiscal position will only be achieved through greater discipline, transparency and accountability in government fiscal policy. The charter of budget honesty will achieve all these outcomes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Fiscal discipline will be enhanced by requiring government fiscal policy to be formulated according to principles of sound fiscal management.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, the charter will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of outdated and misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. In short, this bill will ensure that at all times this government and all future governments can be held accountable for their fiscal and economic policies and thereby provide the basis for a sounder economic performance for the economy as a whole,  sustainable job opportunities for our people and greater accountability of government to the electors whom they serve. I will now describe the main features of the fiscal framework that will be established by the bill.

         The charter of budget honesty will also ensure that up-to-date information is available so that a government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this, the bill establishes a formal reporting structure. With each year's budget, a report will be released setting out economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A further report released midway through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report.

In addition, an intergenerational report will be produced every five years to report on the long-term sustainability of current fiscal policies.

         I repeat: one of the consequences of governments living beyond their means is racking up obligations which narrow the choices of future citizens whose taxes will go to sustaining debt incurred in this generation rather than paying for their own hospitals, schools, roads and the like.

         These reports will provide fundamental information that will allow government performance to be assessed against the objectives set out in the fiscal strategy statement.

         But it would not be just enough for us to say we will fix their problem. We want to make sure that no other government in future behaves in the way in which the Labor government behaved in the March 1996 election. We want to make sure that behaviour of that standard never occurs again. That is why we intend to make it incumbent for a full and open report to be made about the financial state of the books at the opening of an election campaign and not to be found out by whichever government wins at the close.

Never again will the deception attempted by the Labor Party in the last election be allowed if this legislation is enacted.

        This bill contains two important amendments announced in the 1996 budget to clarify the circumstances in which compensation is payable pursuant to the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. The amendments will bring increased financial stability to the scheme whilst maintaining the government's commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment and fair compensation for any employee who suffers a work&amp;hyphen;related injury.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In proposing the amendments, the government has considered a number of factors. We have looked at the basic principles which underpin the workers compensation scheme, assessed the scheme's current performance,
        <break page="8185" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and made projections regarding the future financial liabilities of the scheme. Attention has also been paid to developments in state and territory jurisdictions, and I note here the recently released interim report of the heads of workers compensation authorities—the HWCA report—which contains a number of recommendations to address the major structural and operational problems facing workers compensation systems in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Speaker, in 1988 the Commonwealth introduced a new scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for its employees. The aim of the new scheme was to establish a more equitable and cost&amp;hyphen;effective compensation system, a system which minimised the human and financial cost of work&amp;hyphen;related injury and disease while providing adequate compensation for persons who are injured in the course of their employment by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In reviewing performance to date, it is clear that the adoption of a more focused approach to prevention, rehabilitation and claims management has reduced the personal and economic costs of injury and disease in Commonwealth employment for a number of reasons.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst this is encouraging, workers compensation schemes right across Australia are currently facing upward pressure on their costs. The Commonwealth's liabilities as at 30 June 1995 totalled $1.4 billion, and despite a decrease in the number of claims, an increase in both the complexity and duration of claims is leading to higher program costs. This, coupled with the fact that it is extremely difficult to accurately project future claims liabilities, means that the ultimate financial position of the scheme cannot be taken for granted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A key element of the 1988 reforms was the attempt to clearly specify the circumstances in which compensation was payable. Under the previous legislation, a claimant only needed to show that his or her employment was a contributing factor in the contraction of a disease. This frequently resulted in the Commonwealth being liable to pay compensation for diseases which had little, if any, connection with employment.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The 1988 reforms sought to remedy that situation by providing instead that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must have contributed in a material degree to the contraction of the disease. In the second reading speech to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the then Minister for Social Security, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, said:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she is engaged.
        </para>
        <para>
         It was believed that this test was firm but fair, and properly balanced the interests of the Commonwealth as an employer, and its employees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Subsequent events revealed that the 1988 amendments did not achieve parliament's intentions in this respect. In Re Miers and Commonwealth of Australia v. Comcare, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that `material' meant pertinent or likely to influence. In other words, a claimant was entitled to receive compensation despite the fact that his or her employment had not significantly or substantially contributed to the contraction of the disease.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Similar decisions in other jurisdictions have progressively extended the liability of employers to cover a growing number of claims for conditions where work is only a minor contributing factor. This distorts the fundamental objective of workers compensation, which is to provide for losses stemming from occupational injury and disease.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is against this background that a need arises to amend the current definition of `disease' in the SRC Act to strengthen the connection between work and compensable injury by making it abundantly clear that compensation is only payable if a claimant's employment is a significant contributing factor to the disease. To determine whether employment was a significant contributing factor, it will be necessary to have regard to whether a claimant would have contracted the disease if he or she had not been employed with the Commonwealth. In making this
         <break page="8186" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          determination, it may be relevant to look at the nature and duration of the employment, the existence of any medical predisposing factors affecting the claimant's health, the activities of the claimant outside the workplace or any other matter affecting the claimant's health.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By restating the threshold requirement of work&amp;hyphen;relatedness, the government is reactivating the original intention of the scheme that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must be a significant or substantial cause of the disease. In particular, where a disease is not the result of a clearly distinguishable incident in the workplace or is attributable to multiple causes, the amendments will properly ensure that Commonwealth employers do not bear the cost of something for which they have only limited, or no actual, moral responsibility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current legislation also seeks to prevent compensation claims being used to obstruct legitimate management action. Accordingly, the legislation contains what is known as an exclusionary provision which provides that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises from reasonable disciplinary action taken against an employee, or a failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The exclusionary provision applies primarily to claims for occupational stress. However, the provision has been interpreted as confined to injuries arising as a result of formal disciplinary action prescribed by the Public Service Act or action taken pursuant to an award or certified agreement. Therefore, any other management action could form the basis of a compensation claim. Commonwealth employers believe that, in a number of cases, stress claims are being used to register complaints against, or frustrate the taking of, reasonable employment&amp;hyphen;related action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. In 1994&amp;hyphen;95 the average cost per stress claim was estimated to be $32,200, whilst the average cost for a non&amp;hyphen;stress claim was $8,500. In 1991&amp;hyphen;92 Comcare accepted 1,040 claims for occupational stress. This rose to 1,643 in 1994&amp;hyphen;95. In financial terms, the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          overall cost of stress claims has increased from $24 million in 1991&amp;hyphen;92 to $37 million in 1994&amp;hyphen;95, which represented 30 per cent of premium&amp;hyphen;related program costs paid out in that year.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Commonwealth has adopted a comprehensive strategy to address occupational stress. The key elements of this strategy are stress prevention, improved claims management and an appropriate legislative framework. Prevention is being promoted through various projects that Comcare is running in conjunction with agencies and also through a joint working party on stress established under the Australian Public Service agreement. At the same time, claims management has improved greatly since the establishment in January 1995 of the Stress Claims Management Centre.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These current measures are, and will continue to be, vitally important. However, the third strategic element, namely legislative amendment, cannot be overlooked, because the creation of a culture of care in the workplace will fail if the workers compensation legislation does not reinforce the attempt to make occupational stress a mainstream human resource management issue. Furthermore, whilst the financial pressure upon the scheme has been ameliorated by improved claims management, the cost attached to stress claims arising from management action has grave implications for the future sustainability of the scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This trend is occurring throughout Australia and, in response, the HWCA report recommends that all jurisdictions limit compensation for stress by providing that stress which arises from reasonable employer action taken in a reasonable manner regarding discipline, non&amp;hyphen;promotion, termination and similar matters of workplace management is not compensable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second important amendment contained in the bill implements this recommendation. It amends the definition of `injury' in the SRC act to provide that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in
         <break page="8187" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with an employee's employment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As you can see, there is a dual test of reasonableness; that is, for the exclusion to apply, the action must not only be a reasonable type of managerial or administrative action but also have been carried out in a reasonable manner. I emphasise that the phrase `reasonable managerial or administrative action' does not embrace every kind of instruction or action on the part of an employer. The phrase will not generally cover a direction or series of instructions from the employer concerning the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day tasks which an employee performs. Therefore, if an employee suffers stress from an extremely high workload or as a result of the nature of the duties of his or her position, then that employee shall still be entitled to seek compensation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also wish to make it clear that the amendments are primarily aimed at stress or stress&amp;hyphen;related conditions. They do not affect an employee's rights to compensation for a physical injury which results from a physical aspect of the employee's working environment. What we mean by reasonable managerial or administrative action is typical human resource management, personnel or workplace management action; that is, an action or decision which is in some way related to the structure or functioning of the workplace or concerns the formal relationship between the employer and the employee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To give you some examples, reasonable managerial or administrative action would include action taken in a reasonable manner to reclassify, transfer, demote, discipline, counsel or redeploy an employee, or cease the employee's employment. It would also cover a decision based on reasonable grounds not to promote, reclassify, transfer or grant leave of absence to an employee. Employer action relating to the restructure and reorganisation of the Australian Public Service would also constitute reasonable managerial or administrative action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To summarise, an employee will not be entitled to compensation for stress or a stress&amp;hyphen;related injury which arises from reasonable managerial or administrative action, providing
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the action was carried out in a reasonable manner. Once it is established that an action was reasonable, it will then be a question of fact judged by reference to all the circumstances of a particular case as to whether the action was conducted in a reasonable manner. The overall effect of this is to require employers to adopt sound management practices and to deal with employees fairly and honestly in every single case.

         This bill also contains a number of minor policy and technical amendments to the SRC Act and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. These relate in the main to the procedure for determining the contribution payable by each department and Commonwealth authority towards the cost of the administration of the acts. In addition, a number of changes are proposed to streamline administrative arrangements and, therefore, increase the efficiency of Comcare's operational functions.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government considers that the major amendments in this bill reinforce the policy intention of the original architects of the scheme. In so doing, the bill will ensure a fair, efficient and affordable workers compensation system which balances and supports the rights and responsibilities of Commonwealth employers and their employees and which is sustainable for the future without placing an unfair burden on taxpayers. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

        The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 is the second instalment of legislation which will progressively replace Australia's main tax law, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The 1936 act is on the verge of collapsing under the weight of 60 years of constant and largely piecemeal amendment. The rewrite of the income tax laws to make them shorter, clearer and less burdensome is critical to the Australian taxation system. It will reduce compliance and administrative costs and make it easier for business and individual taxpayers to fulfil their obligations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The tax law improvement project has been performing the task of restructuring and rewriting the income tax law. This overhaul is vital and establishes a robust legislative framework which can readily absorb any future changes. By making the law much clearer to follow it will also enable an informed debate about future changes to our tax laws. The tax law improvement project team is to be congratulated for the excellent progress it has achieved towards completing this very major undertaking. It has been greatly assisted by the practical insights and commercial expertise of the consultative committee which advises on the project's work. The committee's comments and suggestions have been a valuable asset and the government is most grateful for their dedication.

         The tax law improvement project has pioneered new techniques to make the legislation more user friendly and understandable. These techniques are now being used in other Commonwealth legislation. There has also been strong interest from overseas in the project, with New Zealand and Britain both undertaking similar rewrite exercises.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The first instalment of the new law, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed by this House with bipartisan support and is presently waiting consideration by the Senate. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts reviewed that bill in detail concluding that the bill was a significant improvement over the current law, being widely regarded as far easier to read and understand. The government proposes that the joint committee should continue its long&amp;hyphen;standing role in this project by considering the bill and reporting on it by 6 March 1997.

         This bill will build on the very sound foundation laid in the first instalment, particularly by the new structure and core provisions. It includes rewrites of the following important rules with general application: assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. Some other rules with more specialised application have also been rewritten and included in the bill. These cover entertainment expenses, primary production deductions, the recoupment of deductible expenses and the sale of leased cars. The bill continues to use the general features established by the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996. These include a new, more logical structure, a new flexible numbering system and the extensive use of material to help the reader, such as examples, diagrams, notes and signposts to other parts of the law.

A change to bring the valuation methods for live stock closer in line with those for other kinds of trading stock will have a revenue cost of up to $10 million in most years and over $25 million in the occasional year where there is a large fall in stock prices.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, how many of us realise what our flag, the Australian flag, truly represents? Its meaning extends across our history, our culture, our parentage and our heritage. Its image, at some point, has struck powerfully in the minds of so many Australians across generations. It is one of the defining symbols of what it means to be an Australian.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my eyes, and, I am sure, in the eyes of the great majority of my fellow Australians, the prospect of its design being changed at the apparent drop of a political hat or on a political whim is sacrilegious. Members of this chamber, and indeed all Australians: nothing gives me more pleasure than to speak out loudly and proudly in support of our Australian flag, a flag that is bathed in truly noble history.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1823, when two military officers were credited with the first recorded attempt to design a national flag for Australia, the first steps towards a nationally recognisable ensign were taken. Significantly, this early design, known as the national colonial flag, featured a stylised representation of the Southern Cross on the Red Cross of St George and included the Union Jack. So began the development and the creation of our Australian flag.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1851, the Australasian Anti&amp;hyphen;Transportation League flag, which again featured the Southern Cross and the Union Jack, was unfurled. Three years later, in 1854, the Eureka flag was raised by aggrieved goldminers at Bakery Hill in Ballarat. That flag captured the very spirit of protest, and demonstrated the power of flags as symbols within this country. I should also mention the flag of
        <break page="8191" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the federation movement of the 1880s and 1890s. It gave substance to their slogan: one people, one destiny, one flag.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think that encapsulates the spirit and feeling generated in our community towards the national ensign. Long before Federation, therefore, Australians had come to see the flag as a means by which to express and define their views, ambitions and unity. The point of this brief tour through history is to define the meaning of this flag, and to demonstrate that a defining symbol of the Australian spirit has long existed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1901, the Commonwealth government held a competition to design two flags, one for official and one for naval purposes. Almost 33,000 entries from around the world were received, with five entrants sharing the prize money of £200 for similar designs. Final approval was given in 1902 for the selected flag, which contained the Union Jack, a Federation Star and the Southern Cross on a blue background, and which was known as the blue ensign. The design selected for the navy was known as the red ensign and was identical in every way except for the red background. Since 1903 the Australian national flag has remained unchanged, with one exception, being the addition in 1908 of a seventh point on the Commonwealth Star to symbolise the Commonwealth territories.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        And so I believe, given the importance of maintaining a nationally acceptable flag, that legislation should match community will. Quite simply, our national flag should not be changed without reference to the very people that it represents, and I do not think you will get much argument to the contrary out there with the people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For a good part of this century the national flag, in its unchanged form, has represented our society. Blood, sweat and tears have flowed for it. It has adorned the caskets of soldiers who fell tragically in the line of fire. It has flown proudly at the United Nations. Earlier this year, it billowed proudly at Atlanta at both the modern Olympic Games and the paralympics, showing the world that Australia was indeed there.

         The previous Labor government made it quite clear that they were in favour of chan ging the flag and raised the issue on a number of occasions. Indeed, the debate about the Australian flag was raised to the top of the flagpole as the republic debate took off at full speed just prior to the 1993 election. `Change the government, not the flag' bumper stickers on many cars bellowed, and the chattering of many Labor members' teeth at the thought of it quickly lowered the debate to half mast as opinion poll upon opinion poll and overriding public sentiment indicated and vindicated support for the maintenance of the current flag.

        The federal coalition, through this hard&amp;hyphen;headed approach by the Labor Party, had recognised the real agenda behind the debate, and on several occasions attempted to introduce flag amendment bills requiring a plebiscite to change the flag.

        On Australia Day this year—a day most appropriate to putting this issue on the table and taking the political dithering and diatribe out of the debate to change the flag at a whim—the commitment was placed on the table to amend the Flags Act by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a leader truly patriotic to his country, his people and his flag.

        The average person was clearly aggrieved that the kite&amp;hyphen;flying to change or question the value of the flag should be allowed to go on unabated, and there was a real fear that it could be changed without their say. The former Prime Minister thrust history lesson after history lesson down our throats over the flag. His understanding of history, and a lot of his political beliefs, needed boning up. It is little wonder that people viewed any hint of a change to the flag with the greatest fear and trepidation. Back then, as now, there simply was no overwhelming support to change our flag from its current form.

        Nobody can deny the people's right to voice an opinion, least of all me, but change needs more than the views of one small group or launching a spurious debate and airing arguments all for political expedience. That is what this legislation will bring about—keeping the goodwill of a nation over its national symbols.

         A case in point is the principally noble argument that our fellow Australians fought and died under the Australian national flag at war. The actual fact that this is not quite the case is a moot point, but the fact that such a public misnomer could be a simple catalyst to open up the possible political moves to change the flag without a vote by the people is just a critical reason for this legislation. The fact is the national flag was flown and seen during both world wars and, in addition, Australian servicemen would often see the Union Jack and the flags of our allies. There is no doubt whatsoever that Australians in the main served under their own national flag.

         The Australians who did fight and die under the Australian national flag, however, were those Australian military personnel who went to Korea, Malaysia, Borneo and South Vietnam. Further, the welcome home parade for our veterans in Sydney just a few years ago with over 500 Australian flags leading the march reinforced the point. The Australian flag was held in very high esteem by our diggers serving over there and to tell them that this flag could be changed by `a good political idea at the time' should not be allowed, and indeed would not be accepted.

It is but one reason not to float the idea of change at the whim of a political

         Perhaps the most critical point in this whole debate is that quite simply and surely the current Australian flag has come to be identified by all Australians as being a credible and very acceptable Australian symbol.

Democracy is embodied by the famous quote from an even more famous person, Abraham Lincoln, who advocated: `From the people, for the people, by the people.'

By most international standards, a flag is the most enduring symbol of nationhood. It surpasses individuals; it surpasses buildings.

        It is interesting to hear the remarks of the member for Chifley (Mr Price) because he complains about various aspects of the design of our flag. He makes the point, for instance, that he might like to introduce a little of the so&amp;hyphen;called—and I underline those words—Aboriginal flag as part of the design of a new flag. He quite correctly states that the Aborigines were the original inhabitants of this continent, this geographic area; but, furthermore, he infers that their cultural significance should be recognised in our flag.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have made the point before that one of the great aberrations of the Aboriginal movement is their choosing to design a flag. A flag had no place in Aboriginal culture until the arrival of Europeans, and until quite recent times Aboriginal people never paraded, never fought and never did anything with a flag. It has been a clever device to attract the interest of the Europeans and those other sectors of Australia's diverse community today where a flag, a banner and those sorts of trappings are institutionalised. There never was an Aboriginal flag at the tribal, state or nationhood level, and it is a prostitution of their culture to put so much concentration on it today. I find it quite repulsive to see two gentlemen, the Dodson brothers, come into this parliament wearing Akubra hats as evidence of their Aboriginality when Aboriginal people never ever wore hats.

        It is not part of their culture. It is just a case of very smart people using symbolism that is associated with European culture to somehow create an image in the European mind of what is Aboriginal culture. They are entitled to their culture; they are entitled to respect it. I just suggest they practise it. To suggest that an Aboriginal flag is part of Aboriginal culture cannot be substantiated by history. They never had one, and that is a fact.

        The Australian flag is what it is—it was created at the birth of this nation as a whole. It was a design submitted to a competition and it was accepted by the people. It could have been pink with purple polka dots as far as I am concerned. Fortunately, it is not. The member for Chifley complained about its similarity to the New Zealand flag. That is an unfortunate accident of history. It is not a problem for me. The reality is they are two of the most attractively designed flags that exist around the world.

        The reality is that when nations set out to redesign their flags—and I remind people to look outside this place on special occasions when flags are flown in great numbers—very few of them would reach the standards of attractiveness of the Australian flag in a fit.

        The Canadians decided that they needed a unique identity so they chose a red flag with a white maple leaf in the middle of it which looks like a school kid drew it. Would anybody suggest that that flag is a much better design than the one they had before? In pure design terms, it is very unattractive and very pedestrian. I do not want to pick on the poor old Canadians, but it is an example of how these people can say there is always something better in the future.

        The simple fact is that we now have an orchestrated campaign of attacks on our established institutions. It is part of a deliberate campaign to denigrate our history, to suggest that there was something wrong with us, that we should apologise to the world because we are here. I say that Australia is outstanding throughout the entire world in terms of the achievements of two centuries compared to those of tens of thousands of years. I refer to the achievements of two centuries in terms of the development of this country and, more particularly, the establishment of democratic institutions.

        We can look with pride at 200 years, practically—certainly 150—of absolute democracy. Traditionally, very few parts of the world today can claim that record. Why is it necessary to change the symbol that is totally associated with that democratic process? We have had absolute democracy from the day on which that design was approved. If we check what has happened in other parts of the world, some of those that have changed their flags change them every time they get democracy for a while. Does that improve them? Of course not.

         As I say, there is an undercurrent in all of this. It is a process of trying to tell Australians there is something wrong with them. I am pleased to say that when this bill is passed the message that politicians or these activists will get from the Australian people, should they choose to change the design of this flag, is that the Australian people do not concur with that view. They are proud of their achievements. They are anxious for the future of their children. In fact, they do not want us wasting our time on these peripheral issues.

While I am among the first to say the flag has served us well throughout this century, I am aware that there are strong feelings within the community that the current national flag does not represent all the roots, all the aspirations, now represented within our community.

I remember that, some five months ago when I was sitting around a camp fire in the Australian bush with a blazing fire under the Australian stars, a member of the group read out this piece of poetry by an unknown author.

        The Flags Amendment Bill that we are considering at the moment is the Howard government keeping its election promise to make the Australian flag much harder to change. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) originally announced this legislative amendment, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) immediately announced Labor would not oppose this legislation—even though for more than a decade now Labor have persistently done so. At the same time, a spokeswoman for the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, said the Democrats retained an open mind on the need for a referendum on this matter.

         I would think that the Labor Party should be mindful of why their recent primary vote fell to its lowest level since 1913. The former Prime Minister's penchant for changing Australian icons is, I am sure, just another reason why the Australian people turned against the ALP on 2 March. I trust the Democrats hear the same message.

         In researching today's speech, I believe I have unearthed a conspiracy against Queensland that involves New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that I represent Townsville, the capital city of North Queensland, and I have previously told this House of the importance of Townsville. So it will not surprise you when I tell you that the Australian flag was first flown in Flinders Street, Townsville, North Queensland.

        <para first-indent="16">
         At that time the result of a competition for an Australian flag was announced. The then Governor-General, the Rt Hon. John Hope—the Earl of Hopetoun—was touring the north and was in Townsville. An enterprising Townsville sailmaker, William McKenzie, immediately produced the flag and the Governor-General accepted an invitation to fly the flag for the first time.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Now, for the first part of this conspiracy, enter the Victorians. I am advised that history shows that the Victorians heard about what was to happen in Townsville and they too made up a flag in Melbourne. They invited the Governor-General's wife to fly the flag a day earlier. However, this had no official status and under flag protocol at the time the Governor-General's wife was not recognised.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Now, for the second part of the conspiracy, enter the New South Welshmen. In 1922 a request was received from the national museum, then located in Sydney. They asked Townsville to send Australia's first flag to their museum. The local Townsville council, in the national interest, decided to relinquish custodianship of this piece of history. The flag was duly forwarded to Sydney. Sadly, I report it has never been seen again.

         It was on Anzac Day of this year that the Prime Minister reaffirmed this government's commitment to all Australians that they would be consulted in the form of a referendum or plebiscite before any changes to the national flag are made. Anzac Day is the most important day of the year for RSLs throughout Australia. It is an important day for all Australians, but especially for our veterans and our Defence Force personnel.

         This House has heard in the past from a number of members on this issue and on whether or not the Australian flag should be changed. Many have harked back to the days of World War I—in particular, Gallipoli—because those days were defining moments for Australia in terms of our national identity. Each year hundreds of Australians, many of them young backpackers, travel to Gallipoli to commemorate the occasion, to visit the historical sites, to walk the old trenches and to pray and reflect on what took place there so many years ago. In recent years we have seen attendances at Anzac Day marches and dawn services grow even stronger. That

         But just as we are a nation beginning to look afresh at our own history—last year's VP 50 celebrations, which originated from Townsville, were a great example of that—we should also remember that Australian personnel have also been involved in more recent theatres of conflict. While healthy debate will continue as to which flag our Anzac soldiers saw and fought the most under—the British Union Jack or the Australian blue ensign—there is no doubt which flag Australia's recent peacekeeping contributions in places such as Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and the Gulf were conducted under on behalf of the United Nations.

         In 1993, Australian defence personnel from 1 Battalion served in Baidoa, Somalia, as part of a United Nations humanitarian mission. When the Australians arrived in Baidoa, they arrived in a town that had ceased to function and where people were literally dying in the streets. After years of civil war the government of Somalia had collapsed and with it all sense of organised infrastructure. There were no hospitals, no police force and no legal system. Armed gangs of bandits roamed throughout the cities and country. Villages were attacked and destroyed for their food. The 1 Battalion were given command of an area of operation of some 18,000 square kilometres to secure. They did it in a wonderful way, and there have been some recent awards for that. They served under the flag we are talking about at this point. The Australian flag is just as important and holds just as much meaning to current serving members of the Australian Defence Force and their families as it does to our veterans, retired Defence Force members and their families.

         It was interesting to see the reaction back here in Australia to some of the symbols of Australia on display during the closing ceremony in Atlanta—the kangaroo, the waratah, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the didgeridoo, the surf and the sails of the Sydney Opera House. Australians define themselves and who they are in different ways and through different symbols. For some it is the surf and the sand, while for others it is the outback and the earth. But the one symbol Australian athletes and supporters have united around is the Australian flag.

The opposition supports the Flags Amendment Bill, but I need to make the point that the flag that we have was not decided on by referendum. It has served and honoured this nation for some 95 years. I know of no suggestion by any government to change the flag by legislation.

        We need to look back at the origin of the flag. I have listened to some of the debate and some of the outpourings from the hearts of members opposite. It is fascinating listening to how they devise history and how they become attached to an article that really was brought together as the result of a competition set about by a tobacco company. When people set out to have a national flag the Havelock Tobacco Company put up £25 to run a national competition. Ultimately, the national government—and I will go into this in a bit more detail later—was shamed into adding to that and increasing the prize money.

        But let us not have any inhibitions about this. We are Australians; that is how we do things. If we look at the horrific incidence of gambling today, which conservative governments around this country support, in some ways it would be a nasty cut to make if we go back to the origin of the flag and point to the fact that it started out as a competition put up by a tobacco company in the 1900s.

         Looking more deeply at Australian history, if you take from settlement in 1788 and the radicalism of Australians, about 100 years after 1788 Australians had sovereign governments in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, but they had this radical idea that even though they had sovereign govern ments—and each of those sovereign governments or colonies, as they were known, had their own flag—they wanted to have a federation; they wanted to be one nation. That was pretty radical thinking in those times—a mere 100 years after settlement as a convict colony.

        The 20 years or so of debate that went on about how to form a federation ensued. When those radicals became accepted and it was agreed that they should form together as a federation, one of the first things they decided was that they needed to have a national flag. This line of reasoning of having only one flag forever—it must remain forever and without that flag I will be absolutely desolate and probably die—needs to be seen in the perspective that we have had 36 different flags in use in this country. Each of those sovereign states had their own flag—and they are all still in use today.

We are Australians and most of us understand it, but I am sure lots of other people do not understand what we are about.

Edmund Barton, announced that the prize money for the winning designs had to be equally divided between five persons whose designs were more or less similar. So the designs were combined, then displayed. Later photographs show that this flag was very similar to the one that was later officially proclaimed.

        For many years the Commonwealth blue ensign was regarded as the official flag and its use on land was restricted to government establishments. The flying of the ensign on land by individuals and non&amp;hyphen;government bodies was discouraged. This is the same flag that we hear members of the government raving rhetorically about. The use of this flag by individuals or non-government bodies was discouraged, although in 1941 Prime Minister Menzies directed that there should be no restriction on the flying of the flag. How could people display this flag and pay homage to this flag when its use on land by individuals and non&amp;hyphen;government bodies was discouraged?

        In February 1947, Chifley issued a press statement encouraging the application of a directive from Menzies that the flag's greater use on public buildings, by schools and private citizens not only was permitted but would be appreciated. The proviso was that it be flown in a manner appropriate to the use of a national emblem.

        Nevertheless, it had not been clearly established that any particular flag was the national flag until 1951. King George VI approved the recommendation from the government that the Commonwealth blue ensign be adopted as the Australian flag. We can go on and on looking at the history of this matter, but the point I want to make is that, 100 years after settlement, the radicals—they had to be radicals; they could not be anything else—wanted to form one nation. They ultimately formed one nation and they then adopted a flag. But they also maintained the use of all the other flags. Many of the other flags are still in use for various occasions and purposes.

        About 100 years after federation it fits the pattern that Australians of this generation are looking to some stronger form of national identity. They want something that is more Australian with which they can identify—not a flag or a symbol that has the flag of another nation on it—but something that is as uniquely Australian as the Canadian flag is unique to Canada.

        No one would dispute the import and impact of the symbol of the Canadian flag, and that is what younger Australians are yearning for. That is why, at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, we saw young Australians in the audience displaying the boxing kangaroo, not our national flag. It was simply an expression of our younger Australians' yearning to express themselves and to be seen and identified as uniquely Australian. That is simply the normal process of the development of our culture from our backgrounds, gaining a sense of independence and wanting to be seen and identified across the world as being uniquely Australian. I think that is a very healthy process.

We advance the need for a strong national spirit and strong national identity in the international fora, but which one is which? I just do not understand why we still pursue this idea of state flags, the myriad of flags which have evolved which make up that total of 36.

I do so having previously spoken in the House on the question of the restoration of civics to the curricula of our primary and high schools throughout the country and the desirability of a proper, moderate, but nonetheless firm, sense of patriotism throughout the population more widely.

Flags are raised again to symbolise our victory in battle, and fall to acknowledge our defeat.

There is a proper reverence for a symbol like the flag, which the member for Chifley touched on when he was referring to his private member's bill which contemplated the idea of making it unlawful to burn or to deface an Australian flag.

        The second reason I am attached to the flag is that I think it is one of the most beautiful, one of the most effective and, dare I say, one of the most representative symbols that one could possibly conceptualise. If we turned to the five key elements of the flag, we would start with the three crosses which make up the ensign in the top canton of the flag. The Australian flag has four crosses. The first three are the red cross of St George, the white saltire of St Andrew and the red saltire of St Patrick.

        The Union Jack is the source of greatest offence to some in this debate. It is a source of irritation, a source of embarrassment.

        The meaning of the flag is, to some extent, in the eye of the beholder. Often our response to it tells us more about ourselves—our own prejudices, if you like—than about the flag itself. I see those three crosses very much in the language of the poem that was read into

It is not the brilliant verdant green of the House of Commons, but the sort of burnt eucalyptus green of the Australian countryside. Likewise in the Senate, we see the burnt red symbolising the soil of the outback. Nonetheless, the institution is down to fairly fine detail, modelled on that of Westminster. I am greatly attached to the institution—not just because of emotions or sentiments but

        So when I look upon the canton in the top corner of our flag, I do not feel embarrassed. It is something about which I feel some pride and something which does not offend me in the slightest in terms of our sense of identity and sovereignty as an Australian nation. It reflects, as has been said by previous speakers, our history, our inheritance—it refers to the foundation stones on which all of the other great things we have done as a nation have been built.

        We turn then to the federation star—again, a beautifully non-discriminatory image which embraces each one of the six states and the territories of Australia. Finally, we go to the fourth cross in the Australian flag—the Southern Cross. Might I say that no image could have a more universal quality. It is difficult to conceptualise one that could be more ancient. When we think about the representation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the flag, it is they more than others who can feel a sense of ownership over the heavens, with their great ideas of the dreaming, of history, of traditions and of tribal values. I regard that as one of the great things about the Southern Cross.

        The third basis upon which I support the bill is that it reflects a characteristic of this government which is a desire to bridge the gap which has emerged between the Australian people and their national parliament, their national government. There has been an increasing feeling among many Australians that when they look at the institutions of their national government they feel a sense of discord, a sense of dissonance, and a sense foreignness about that which is coming forth from this place. This bill, if you like, is a step back towards the people. It is just giving them some assurance that they are not going to wake up one morning and discover that, by the arbitrariness and the capriciousness of the

I see evidence of a kind of utopian perfectionism coming through in some of the remarks of those around the chamber. We are not going to achieve perfection. We are looking for the best possible outcome. It is my view that this bill rightly gives the Australian people that greater measure of reassurance that we are listening, that we are not going to act in a sudden or hasty way, that their views are important to us, that we are a listening government and that we are not about to take one of the important symbols of the nation and simply arbitrarily amend or change it.

        I want to conclude my remarks with a reference to the fact that that top corner of the flag is traditionally known as the canton—`canton' coming from the French word meaning corner. Canton is a word that is familiar to we legislators from the Swiss experience of direct democracy in which the people gathered together not in some representative way but directly to take the decisions according to any piece of legislation or any new government initiative.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That is an appropriate reference for us here. There is a symbolism and a synergy between the canton as the top corner of the flag and the canton as the Swiss expression of direct democracy. The only real equivalent we have to the canton in our Westminster tradition is in fact the referendum. That is precisely what this bill is about. It is being put back into the

        There are many people in this country who were worried about the approach of the former Prime Minister and many others who were running in his pack who saw the flag and other national symbols as up for grabs—as theirs to change as they would like. They wanted to chop and change them around with little regard for the view of the broader Australian community. This quite simply was a very wrong attitude and contributed to the collective reasons for the decisive view which Australians expressed on 2 March.

I consider such an act on such a day as one against all Australians, because it is quite simply treasonous, in my submission, to treat our flag in such a way. It is a direct attack on all of us who want to work together as a united community. It is not a vote for free speech to burn our national symbols; it quite simply is a vote for anarchy. It is simply not good enough, and I and so many other Australians were deeply offended by such an action on such a day.

It has been the rallying cry in times of trouble and in times of triumph. It is the flag which has dictated our history and our place in the world geographically. It is the flag which hundreds of thousands of Australians have, sadly, died for, fighting to defend our country and our way of life. To change our Australian flag is to spurn their contribution. To change the flag would be an act conceived in ignorance and selfishness.

A simple act of parliament without any reference to the people in the form of a referendum could make this happen.

         I would like to deal with some of the details of the bill. This bill simply reflects the wise principle of the Australian people having the right to be consulted on any proposed change to the flag. The Australian national flag belongs to all people in Australia. This bill provides the people of Australia with a guarantee from this parliament that it is they, and not politicians, who will decide if their national flag should be changed. It does not seek to override the right of parliament to legislate, for it will still  require some legislation to endorse the will of the people and make any new flag which may be chosen law.

          This section of the bill requires the existing national flag to be one of the choices offered to the people. It is really quite disgraceful conduct, often promoted in the media by those who want to change the Australian flag, to never put forward as one of the viable options the current flag. What an absolute disgrace and a bit of blatant social engineering to say, through such an action, our current flag is not good enough so choose from one of these others. Put the current Australian flag forward as one of the submissions in any design competition and we know which one will get through.

          The federation star, with its seven points, depicts the six states and the territories. The Union Jack, as the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) said, in the canton of the flag, represents the flags of the various patron saints of the British Isles. There is the Cross of St George, the patron saint of England and Wales; the saltire—the cross on a diagonal—of St Andrew, which is for Scotland; and the saltire of St Patrick, which is for Ireland.

          The old argument that our flag is like so many others because it has the Union Jack in the corner is absolute nonsense.

The Union Jack is also on the New Zealand flag and, interestingly, the state flag of Hawaii, the island state of the United States of America. It symbolises the history of European settlement in each of those places.

          It is interesting to reflect upon a couple of South American and Central American countries which have on their flags the stripes of the Stars and Stripes, the United States flag, because they have some sort of relationship with the United States.

Many people, I submit, who want to see a change in the flag do not feel confident about Australia or about themselves.

If we lined up all the flags from the different countries of the world, how many could people individually identify? So I do not accept that argument being pushed.

        In the wake of the tragic events at Port Arthur in April, my government, in cooperation with state governments and with the full support of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, delivered strong national gun laws prohibiting automatic and semiautomatic weapons. This action alone has made a lasting contribution to a safer and more peaceful Australian community. Both symbolically and in substance it struck a defiant blow against a culture of violence which too readily permeates our community and which has wreaked such terrible consequences in other nations.

        It is worth while recalling just how far we have come in the 10 months since the people decided to place their trust in a new coalition government on 2 March this year.

        We have set Australia on a new course of proper fiscal responsibility built on increased national savings, the maintenance of low inflation, reduced pressure on interest rates and restoring the underlying budget balance to surplus.

        Families with a $100,000 mortgage are saving around $145 a month in interest payments as a result of the fall in the variable home loan interest rate of 1¾ per cent. If today's cut is passed on in full—and there is already a veritable stampede of banks to do so—then the saving will amount to $188 a month for the average Australian family. This will drive housing interest rates in Australia to their lowest level since 1974. Let me repeat that: the lowest housing interest rate since 1974—$188 a month in savings for the average Australian family.

         Small business is part of the heart and soul of the value systems of all members of this government. Small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy.

         On the tax front, one of our first actions was to cut the provisional tax uplift factor. In the budget, we implemented our promises to provide rollover relief from capital gains tax to allow small businesses to grow. We also provided an exemption for up to half a million dollars on capital gains on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement. After listening to small business people, we recently made the scheme

         We have already made a start on cutting red tape, regulation and the paperwork that bedevil so many hardworking small business operators. The ABS is reducing the burden of statistical collections on small businesses by 20 per cent. The report of the small business deregulation task force was received on 1 November 1996. That document will be responded to—in full and in a positive fashion—by the government no later than the middle of February 1997.

Discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto, and President Soeharto of Indonesia made clear their interest in cooperating closely with Australia under my government. At the APEC leaders meeting in Manila, I met the Chinese President, Mr Jiang Zemin, and underlined the importance the new government placed on our relationship with that country.

Vanstone must go; Downer must go. This is the view in these departments. Downer is obviously going to go. Moore is obviously going to go.

        As well as a bit of humility, a bit of balance, a bit of even&amp;hyphen;handedness, what the Australian public also likes to see is a bit of leadership. The Prime Minister mentioned guns and the laws that have been implemented to deal with the plethora of firearms in our community. We have congratulated him on this many times and he showed leadership in the Australian community on that issue. However, I think we are sufficiently distant from it now to do a bit of analysis. The simple fact of the matter is that this was not necessarily a tremendously difficult task to undertake. It was a negotiating task, there is

        I am going to take that a point further on Tim Fischer. He alone amongst those in leadership positions in this government has stood unequivocally against the statements made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). He alone, on the front bench of this government, was prepared to sign that declaration on racial tolerance. He alone—as far as that front bench was concerned, and the foreign minister is out the back door as far as this issue is concerned—understood immediately, without being told, the impact that this would have on our relationships with the region around us. He alone understood what was required in the exercise of leadership in this place.

        There is something else that needs to be said here and that is this: the statements of the member for Oxley, execrable as they were, were not unusual or unique in their expression, either in the Australian community or, for that matter, in parliament. They were not. They happened to be exceptional in their erroneous factual basis, but the motives underlying them were not exceptional.

        What changed the debate was a statement about freedom of speech.

It is a very narrow definition of leadership which glories in our poor performances in the polls and seeks to make them worse by seeing whether or not we can tweak the immigration issue a bit. It is a very poor leader who goes into the caucus of his party and says, `A terrible mistake was made by the Labor Party because it did not support all our changes in the immigration area. I would just like to tweak that one a little bit.' That is not leadership in this community.

He used it as an excuse to knock out that good public policy to produce for himself a situation in which he hoped, three years down the line, he would have a budgetary position that would provide him with a war chest to deal with his subsequent election campaign.

You have no responsibility whatsoever for the lowering of interest rates, except a negative one. You have contributed to the flattening out of the Australian economy. That has been your role in lowering interest rates. What has caused interest rates to come down—the essential

         underpinnings of it—is that we achieved low inflationary growth, sufficient for the Reserve Bank to be trusting of the situation in which they find themselves. Secondly, it is we who introduced the productivity based wage reforms, which have ensured wage outcomes that the Reserve Bank could begin to trust. What has come out of your industrial relations changes is paltry in comparison to what came out of the changes that we put in place and, I might say, as we have pointed out repeatedly, completely unnecessary. Don't think the business community doesn't know it. The business community is not doing handsprings, not jumping through hoops, on the basis of the industrial relations changes you have put in place.

It was marginal. It was not a massive increase in interest rates whatsoever and we left the way for them to come down. Unfortunately, I think the Reserve Bank has made a misjudgment. I agree with Bernie Fraser and I said so at the time, given that there is no stimulus coming through from the budget, given that the economy has been substantially talked down by this government. They are now trying to talk it up, but they have spent six months doing the opposite, sending the other message. Given all of that, their one last hope in town was for the Reserve Bank to produce a bit of a punch through and they really should have done a one per cent cut—three or four weeks ago—not the half that they did and the half that they did today.

It was about 60 per cent of our rate of achievement and on the last set of figures, everybody said, `Oh gee, terrific, after four months of coming down, we've got a 2.1 per cent lift in the ANZ jobs vacancies predictor.' What does that produce? Half the rate to achieve that paltry figure of 60 per cent of what we achieved. No wonder it was Banquo's ghost at the feast as far as jobs were concerned.

If we really got Laurie Brereton that would be a good thing, but we will not actually get Laurie because he is going to stay on the frontbench—and he will be chained to the bench if he tries anything in this regard! What we got was the re&amp;hyphen;creation of Laurie Brereton's job. If people cast their minds back to who the new projects officer was, they will

        As far as jobs are concerned, we have seen a rate of increase in long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment of about 10,000 a month since the middle of this year.

Mr Prime Minister, you are failing, your government is failing, in the area of foreign affairs and defence policy.

         —As I was saying before we adjourned to listen to the address of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Australian flag is a very important symbol. We should recognise it as a symbol which is more important to the people that live within Australia that recognise it as our national flag and as our national symbol; we should not place so much emphasis on what it means or its recognisability to people overseas.

        It is interesting to note that earlier this year AGB McNair polled a number of Australians as to whether they thought the Australian flag should be changed. Sixty&amp;hyphen;six per cent said no and only 27 per cent said yes. That reinforces the comment I made earlier with regard to the attitude, particularly amongst young people in Australia today, to our national symbol, and it is very important. I make a particular effort to get to as many schools as I can in my electorate, not just presenting the Australian flag to young Australians but actually explaining the importance and the significance of the elements of our Australian flag.

        That is incredibly important in that educational process and I think that is probably what has been lacking in recent years. In my generation, we used to have the flag raising ceremony at school and we used to go through the process. But we were not ever taught at school about the importance of the elements and the symbolism of that national flag. It is important to note that a flag tells a country and its people their history. It symbolises our beginning and our heritage. The Australian flag tell us where we came from, where we are and our duty to the future. It is well known across the length and breadth of this country—the symbolism of the Southern Cross. That signifies where this great south land sits in the globe and in world affairs, that we are in the southern hemisphere.

         Interestingly, during the Australia Remembers year last year, I had the opportunity to talk to a number of prisoners of war who were incarcerated in Changi Prison in Singapore during the Second World War. One of the things that kept them going through those very hard years was the fact that they could actually see the Southern Cross in the southern sky and they knew that is where Australia was. That is incredibly important to those people, as it should be to everybody today. The Federation Star was originally on the flag as a six&amp;hyphen;pointer but then the territories were added and it became a seven&amp;hyphen;point star. That symbolises what the Commonwealth of Australia is made up of, that we were a number of colonies or states to start with that came together as a federation.

         Just as importantly, there is the Union Jack. There is not a broad understanding of the importance and the heritage of the Union Jack. I suppose it is important to me as a Christian, but the Christian and biblical background of the Union Jack is very important and it is something that should be understood by all Australians if we ever got to the situation where as a country we were going to vote on whether or not we should be changing the flag. We should understand the elements of that flag. Yes, the Union Jack is the flag of the United Kingdom, it is the flag of another country, but the elements that come together to create the Union Jack have a much deeper cultural meaning to a lot of people in Australia than just the fact that it is a flag of another country.

         The date of the completion of the Union Jack was 1801, and this coincided with the growth of the British commonwealth of nations under Queen Victoria. But what does the Union Jack mean? There are three things to remember about it: its name and the three countries it stands for; the three crosses and their meaning; and the three colours, red, white and blue, and their meaning. Originally, under the reign of King Richard I, in about 1189, the English flag had only one cross because it was for one country, and that was England. This cross was red on a white background and was called St George's Cross,
         <break page="8236" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          after St George, who was the patron saint of England.

         It is interesting to know a bit of background about St George. St George was born around the second half of the third century at Lydia in Palestine. His father was an officer of great wealth in the army of Diocletian, the Roman emperor. His mother was a daughter of the Count of Lydia. This Lydia is the same area that St Peter himself visited, which visit resulted in the conversion to Christianity of the whole town. That is the Cross of St George, and that is the red cross.

         In 1801, in the reign of George III, Ireland was added to England and Scotland and with Ireland came its national flag of St Patrick, a red diagonal cross on a white background. The three crosses were then blended together to become our present Union Jack, which signifies the union of England, Scotland and Ireland as one Christian country under the blessing of the cross of the new covenant.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         St Patrick of Ireland has an interesting background as well. St Patrick is the patron saint and national apostle of Ireland and there seems to be some confusion as to his exact date and place of birth. This is probably brought about by the fact that St Patrick is often mistaken for other characters of the same name and the same era. The most common evidence is that he was born in Dumbarton, Scotland, some time around the year 373 A.D.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third element of the Union Jack is the Cross of St Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. The national religious emblem of Scotland is St Andrew's Cross and he is the patron saint of Scotland. According to the Gospel of St John, Andrew was a brother to St Peter and is the first apostle named. The gospel further states that Andrew was a disciple of John the Baptist before Christ's call.

          Interestingly, they are the elements that make up the Union Jack. It is not just about the flag of another country, it is about a biblical heritage. And with this nation being predominantly a Christian nation—and I admit it is not all Christian—it is very important that we recognise the symbolism and the heritage in those three elements of the Union Jack. It is not just about the cross of another nation.

          It is interesting to note that some commentators say that the name, the Union Jack, is a contraction of the union of Jacob and that the settlers in England, Scotland and Ireland were actually from the sons of Jacob who ended up in Great Britain. The Union Jack is actually the union of Jacob. That is very interesting to note. This is one argument that is quite often put with regard to the development of that national flag.

          In closing, let me say that it is very important to the people of Australia, if they are ever going to consider changing our national flag, that they have the opportunity to vote on it. The flag is not to be changed within this place by politicians, by governments. The people of Australia must have the opportunity to vote on any change to our national flag.

          Also, and most importantly, everybody in this country should understand the different elements of the flag and the symbolism that is contained within that flag. I encourage all members in this place to take the opportunity to distribute the national flag, particularly to schools in their electorates, as I do, and take the opportunity to explain the important symbolism and heritage that is contained in the different elements in the Australian flag. I commend the bill to the House.

Why is the government doing nothing more than writing letters to the oil companies about petrol terminal access and competitive wholesale prices? Do you recognise the enormous benefits to primary industries and country petrol consumers of Labor's plan to change the law and give all service station operators legal access rights to shop around for the cheapest wholesale petrol? Why has the government again sold out the bush by refusing to take on the petrol multinationals and guarantee lower petrol prices?

It was the rural sector, more than anybody else, with a massive hike in fuel excise on top of what you had done to it over the years and on top of what you had already done in terms of reducing outlays for road funding. Your record in this area is absolutely appalling. You did nothing. We are putting in place a range of measures which will be elaborated upon this afternoon and which will make a real difference.

Not only is the member for Robertson one of the many examples of successful men and women in small business who have entered the parliament on the Liberal and National party side, but he is also someone who has a very deep understanding of the role of small business in the Robertson electorate.

        You will remember that in the budget we announced that as from 1 July 1997 capital gains tax rollover relief would apply to small businesses with assets below $5 million. This is the important thing to note: at the time of the budget announcement we said that this would apply if the assets were rolled over into another like-kind business. But, as a result of representations that have been made to the government from small business, we have decided to take away that condition. The Treasurer announced last week that the like-kind business test would not apply.

        This particular amendment will greatly increase the incentive to invest in small business. It is going to result in a substantial reduction in compliance costs for small businesses wishing to qualify for the measure. In addition, the government has decided to extend the period—this is also a further important liberalisation—for reinvestment of the proceeds of the disposal from 12 months after disposal until 24 months after disposal. That is a doubling of the period of time. Not only are we removing the like&amp;hyphen;kind business test but also the period has been doubled.

        The government today announces the most comprehensive shake&amp;hyphen;up of the petroleum industry, at least in the last two decades. This is a great structural reform in relation to the petroleum industry. This is a reform which has the capacity to deliver real benefits to consumers. Let me make it entirely clear that, in setting this policy, we have taken into account consumer benefits for those in both regional and rural areas.
       </para>

        In 1997 the government will lift the price surveillance in relation to petroleum products. It will be lifted once the oil majors have provided suitable undertakings for complete and open access at terminals not only to current distributors but also to new entrants, to new independents and to new wholesalers. This will mean that people who arrive at oil terminal gates will have access at open and transparent prices in relation to the material.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government will also ensure that the Laidley agreement is not enforced. The Laidley agreement was one of those grubby deals done by the TWU in order to prevent open access to oil terminals. One of the reasons why the Labor Party did nothing about petrol pricing in 13 years was it was incapable of standing up to the TWU. Once you have a government that governs in accordance with the benefits to consumers and citizens and not trade union tsars you are able to engage in this kind of reform.
       </para>

        In addition, the government will encourage new entrants into the distribution market, some of which have already indicated and have already commenced. We will be encouraging state and local governments who have control of planning requirements to give access to new entrants who can come into the market and provide reform and restructuring in relation to the retail end of the market.

         The government is also disposed towards removing the application of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act once oil companies, distributors and retailers reach agreement on a new oil code and an appropriate code of conduct. We expect that the parties will enter into negotiations to achieve such an outcome over the next 12 months. The Department of Industry, Science and Tourism will work with industry participants to address concerns about an oil code.

In addition, the person will have been required to have had failed treatment in the past and, secondly, at an initial consultation display at least serious symptoms as are defined in the global assessment of functional scale which is contained in the DSM4, the generally accepted international schedule.

This will assist the Health Insurance Commission to police inappropriate psychiatric treatment, something that it has had very great difficulty in doing in the past. Accreditation of psychoanalysts within the college of psychiatrists will take place, and eventually the new item numbers for additional treatments will be restricted to psychiatrists with such accreditation.

         —I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition should ask this question. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition again that, under the telecommunications regime that we are putting in place, there is a guarantee that people will not pay higher charges than they do now. There is a guarantee of greater competition. I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that all his noisy protestations to the contrary cannot disguise the fact that much of the communications regime that is now before the Senate was modelled on an exposure draft that was released by the member for Dobell as the minister for communications in the former government. Included in that comment is the very device to which the Leader of the Opposition draws attention.

        this morning, a journalist who occasionally gives me a bit stick as he does those who sit opposite. He said, in effect, in his article that the world prize for being a bad loser in politics has got to go to the Labor Party on the subject of Telstra. He quite rightly reminded all of us that for 13 years the Labor Party made an art form of saying one thing about privatisation at an election and doing the exact opposite after. He reminded us that you promised not to sell the Commonwealth Bank—and you did. You promised not the privatise Qantas—and you did. You promised not to privatise Australian Airlines—and you did. We promised to sell one-third of Telstra. We are doing it, and you are doing your level best to frustrate the will of the Australian people. That is why you are held in such low repute and poor esteem, particularly on the issue of privatisation.

There was, in the build-up to the last election, tremendous concern out in the community about issues relating to the aviation industry. To see why, one only has to go back to who was in charge of aviation at the time—the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith, known by his colleagues in the Labor Party as Dangerman. Dangerman was in charge of aviation in Australia. Is it any wonder, therefore, that there were some public concerns about it?

        As a consequence of that, the coalition in opposition developed a very substantial aviation policy, which I am very pleased to be able to report to the House. We are in the process of fulfilling that speedily, effectively and fairly. We have designed all of our policies to build a safer, more competitive and more reliable aviation industry that can cope with the enormous growth potential that exists for aviation in Australia.

        One of the highlights in our aviation policy, being released over the last little while, is the finalisation of the single aviation market. Those of us who have taken an interest in aviation over the last few years will remember that the former government talked about developing a single aviation market with New

         Zealand but when push came to shove they could not go with the flow. They could not stand up to the heat and they backed out of the particular agreement which had been agreed with the New Zealand government. When we came into government, we renegotiated a single aviation market and it came into effect on 1 November this year. It is interesting to note how significant a reform this is. The December issue of an aviation industry magazine states:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Not only is the single aviation market the most important aviation event in the last 20 years; it is also arguably the most far reaching economic development in the evolution of Australia-New Zealand relations.

        It goes on to praise the coalition government's implementation of that single aviation market agreement with New Zealand which, incidentally, created a market worth $5,000 million a year, transporting 31 million passengers a year—a very substantial market indeed.

        Also, we have entered into the sale of a number of our FAC airports. Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports are for sale. Adelaide will be put on sale next year. As part of that process, we have announced that landing charges at those airports will actually reduce, under our CPI minus X regime. We announced what the X factor was just the other day. Landing charges at those new privatised airports will go down—in Melbourne by 15 per cent, in Brisbane by 17 per cent and in Perth by 20 per cent—over the next five years under our new regime.

        In addition to that, we have had a substantial increase in international aviation capacity with other countries. It has increased under our negotiating regime by some 13 per cent over the last few months. For example, when we came into office I discovered that we had only one flight per week to China, one of the largest countries in the world and one of the fastest growing economies—an important tourist destination for Australia and for our tourism industry. We increased that under our negotiating regime from one flight per week to ultimately 13 flights per week. We have

Sydney airport was cause of considerable concern for people living in Sydney because of the very incompetent and dishonest management of the third runway at Sydney airport. We have reduced the amount of public concern over that issue simply by implementing our policy of sharing the noise. We have opened the east-west runway. Aircraft movements to the north of Sydney airport have now dropped from 50 per cent to some 33 per cent. Thirty-three per cent of those aircraft movements are now going to the north instead of 50 per cent under Labor's management—

        I do anticipate there will be some significant property divestment and that will be undertaken over the next few years. Frankly, that is going to deliver some very significant savings to the taxpayer and some real business opportunities in the private sector. Already, 11 Commonwealth properties around Australia have been earmarked for sale.

        In addition, the government is outsourcing its property management functions and that will give us an estimated saving of $4 million. In addition, I recently announced the appointment of a series of panels of real estate agents to assist in the sale of Commonwealth properties.

Prior to the election, the coalition promised as one of its major priorities to deliver a new deal for small business. The coalition has also promised significant reforms in the area of consumer affairs and customs. Would the minister explain to the House what the Howard government has achieved in the nine months since the March election?

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. The government can be proud of its remarkable list of achievements in just nine months. In our policy area of a new deal for small business, we certainly have delivered. We have progressed a favourable business climate; responsible economic management has lowered interest rates and given a better deal for small business. There have been three interest rate falls in just five months—a remarkable achievement that directly benefits all small businesses and consumers. In the capital gains tax rollover area, the Prime Minister a short while ago explained to the House that we went further than our policy commitment. While it has been stated before, it is worth quoting again the article from the

        In addition, I will be meeting with state ministers to discuss the Small Business Deregulation Task Force report that was given to the Prime Minister on 1 November. We have instigated a House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading, an issue that small business has been very worried about. So in the small business area we have certainly delivered. After 13 years of being ignored by the previous government we have at least listened to their concerns—and they appreciate that.

They do not understand that in nine months we have given the business sector the opportunity for lower interest rates and the opportunity for confidence to grow. On 1 January, consumer confidence will grow because we are going to give them a tax cut—a great new year's present. It is a remarkable achievement in nine months for this government in the small business, consumer affairs and customs portfolio area. There is no doubt that the small business sector is well served by the Howard government.

        Here is the best illustration of its hypocrisy. In September the New South Wales government announced the results of its so-called forest interim assessment process and then entrenched them in a series of permanent decisions with new wilderness and national park declarations, long-term wood supply agreements and further reductions in wood supply quotas. I would like to know whether the federal Labor Party supports the New South Wales Labor Party.

         —Over two weeks have passed since the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) announced that the government intended to privatise Australian National and to sell its share in National Rail. It is not because of any lack of seriousness or regard for the issue that the opposition has chosen not to raise this for debate in this chamber until the second week of sittings.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <break page="8266" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a very simple reason why we have chosen to do that, that is, to give the minister an opportunity to do the right thing and to make a ministerial statement in the parliament, as he should have done and has failed to do, with respect to this very serious issue. He chose to announce it on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday
         </emphasis>
         program, but to treat this parliament with contempt by not even coming in and making a ministerial statement about a very substantial proposal which was not previously mentioned by the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you look at the content of the proposal, it is no wonder that he has chosen to do this. We have a decision to privatise Australia's National Rail Corporation and Australian National based on a report that the government refuses to release, based on one year's bad figures that the minister is deliberately distorting and grossly inflating to further his case and, in the case of National Rail, based on no bad figures but based on National Rail continuing to perform as it was originally intended to perform when it was established by the former government and gradually moving towards commercial viability within five years and towards break&amp;hyphen;even unsubsidised circumstances. National Rail is broadly on track to achieve this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that the government has only been able to produce one justification, namely, bad figures, for its proposal to privatise Australian National gives an absolute indication that this is completely unjustified when you look at the situation with National Rail, which is on track to commercial viability. It is also a decision based, I might add, on no consultation of any great substance. The Public Transport Union, the main representatives of the workers in Australian National and National Rail, was given a mere 15 minutes before the government's committee in discussions on this issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a decision conceived in secrecy and deceit. It has been gestated in unrelenting hostility to the public sector and the rail industry, and given birth to in a shimmer of distortions and lies. It is interesting to look at coalition policy, where we see no mention of privatisation of Australian National or National Rail, no mention of removing the subsidy
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that has been there for some considerable time and long before the previous Labor government was in office, and no mention of destroying jobs or services in the rail industry.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition policy was not exactly a long document but it states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Coalition will establish a national interstate passenger rail service in partnership with the States, linking all interstate passenger rail services. Australian National will be given the task of operating this new and innovative service designed to increase rail patronage on a fully commercial basis.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Australian National has been poorly treated under the Labor Government. The Coalition is committed to providing AN with a future through such means as the interstate passenger initiative which will increase AN's business base and promote job security for its employees through policies designed to increase the use of rail, utilising an under&amp;hyphen;utilised resource.
        </para>
        <para>
         How hollow these words now sound. Is the government giving AN a future? Is it increasing its business? Is it giving job security, a promise to the workers of AN? Definitely not. It is dismantling it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We hear even today again more unctuousness about previous decisions of the former government with respect to privatisation—about Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank—and claims that these were not taken to the electorate, at the very same time that this government is doing precisely that by proposing to privatise Australian National and its share of National Rail when it has made no commitment to the electorate along those lines and, quite to the contrary, has committed itself to improve and increase Australian National and its business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In September, the minister was forced against his wishes to release the Brew report executive summary in the Senate. This recommended the wholesale dismantling of Australian National but not of National Rail—merely to put National Rail on a commercial basis, which is where it is due to end up in any event.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When it was released the minister said, `Don't assume that we'll do any of these things that were recommended; the report is to the government, not of the government. And in any event it's all Labor's fault; they did nothing, they sat there, they were asleep
         <break page="8267" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          at the wheel, they didn't take any decisions or action to fix the problem.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the same day we got a press release from Australian National indicating it was already starting the process of selling off its core businesses. So on 11 September we heard from the minister, `Labor did nothing, Labor was asleep at the wheel,' but on 12 September, when he is confronted with the draconian proposals to sell the businesses of Australian National, we heard a totally different story: `No, that was all Labor's decisions. That was all Labor's fault, nothing to do with us. Labor's decisions had these in train.' But the lie in this was exposed on the following day, on 13 September—he had a bad run during these three days—when the minister's letter of 15 August to the chairman of AN, Mr Jack Smorgon, was tabled, indicating that he had given specific instructions for the sell&amp;hyphen;off to proceed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then, on 26 September, the real agenda behind the Brew report became clear. The real role of the consultant, Mr Brew himself, was revealed, because at the same time as he was acting as a consultant to the government, advising about the future of the rail industry in Australia, advising about what should be done with Australian National—how the government should treat the future of rail in this country—he was lining himself up to be a consultant to the main bidder to buy Australian National. At the same time as he is advising the government to sell Australian National, he is also getting into bed with the main consortium that is lining up to buy the company.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of that, we now have a completely tainted report. We cannot read the full report, but it is fully tainted, because the person who has done the report, at the same time as he was forming his conclusions, clearly had in mind, `Where can I profit as a result of government decisions with respect to the future of Australian National and National Rail?' Answer: as a consultant to somebody in the private sector who might buy some or all of the businesses that are going to be up for sale. So we had a consultant advising the government, `Go ahead and sell all these things; beauty, I'll be able to get in there at
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the carve&amp;hyphen;up, I'll be able to get my share of the action later on down the track.' Finally, as I indicated, on the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Sunday
          </emphasis>
          program the minister announced that all of it would be sold. He has made a decision effectively to fatten up the assets for a fire sale by restating the government's responsibility for various liabilities such as the AN debt and endeavouring to take on board to the government all existing liabilities for Australian National.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In effect, all that is doing is shifting from one accounting heading to another a set of liabilities that the government already has. The government has those liabilities anyway. The minister said, `This is a $2 billion reform package.' Some journalists, unfortunately, have chosen not to look behind the statement and see it for the absolute lie that it is. It is a restatement of existing liabilities, a restatement of certain commitments already in the budget and carry&amp;hyphen;on commitments from the former government, albeit with substantial reductions in funding—such as the former Track Australia, $161 million—and some very unlikely contingencies, such as $50 million for environmental cleanup.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My information from Australian National is that that figure within AN was based on an assessment of what it would cost to do a decontamination of every single AN site. In other words, it can only have meaning if the entire rail network and the entire business of AN is actually closed down.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We see the superannuation figure there—$580 million. It is a complete fake because AN has been making superannuation payments to the federal government, into consolidated revenue. So it technically has part of its superannuation unfunded, but money has gone into consolidated revenue on a monthly basis. That $580 million covering superannuation is simply an accounting device. It is a complete fraud and the whole $2 billion figure is a complete fraud.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is an even bigger fraud is the claim that AN had a $250 million loss for 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Roughly $140 million of that loss actually consists of one&amp;hyphen;off asset revaluations. Yes, that is an issue, but it is dramatically different from comparing operating revenues and operating expenditure, which is the real issue
         <break page="8268" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          about future bleeding of the business. The minister, Mr Sharp, has grossly misrepresented the situation; again, he refused to tell the people of Australia, particularly people with an interest in AN—those workers, those people who depend on the services of AN—what the real story is, in order to justify what is basically an ideological attempt to get rail out of the public sector, to give a few mates in the private sector a bit of a free kick, have a bit of a fire sale and get the subsidies away from the federal budget.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What he has not actually revealed is that the operating result for AN for 1995&amp;hyphen;96, I am informed, will come in slightly better than what the Brew report predicted. He has also indicated that AN and NR may be sold in bits; in other words, cherry&amp;hyphen;picking may occur. There is no guarantee of existing services being maintained. That was revealed in his answer to my question the other day in the House. There is no guarantee that things like the workshops will not be asset stripped by competitors who will simply buy them up, close them down, take out the assets and look forward to a situation where there is one less major competitor in the marketplace.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Particularly, there are no guarantees about jobs. We have heard some pretty contradictory statements from the minister about jobs. On the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday
         </emphasis>
         program, courtesy of some questions from Laurie Oakes, he was asked, `Will this necessarily mean job losses?' The
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          answer from the minister was, `No, it won't necessarily mean job losses.' On the same day he had a letter going out to all Australian National employees which said, `Further reductions in employment will inevitably result from the sale process.' So on television, to the Australian people, he says, `No, there won't necessarily be job losses,' but to the employees he says, `Sorry, yes there will be.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You can guarantee there will be job losses. What about the workers in Launceston? I visited there last week. The minister has not been seen there. Indeed, the local member, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), has not been seen there. They are very worried about their job futures, as are the workers in South Australia, whose shop stewards I spoke to again yesterday at some length.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no explanation given for selling National Rail, which, as I have indicated, has substantially moved towards its target for commercial viability set by the former government. The interstate freight deficit has fallen from $350 million to $50 million, based on the evidence given by the minister's own department to a Senate committee on 19 September and vindicated by National Rail itself on 22 October to the same committee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been a $300 million reduction in the deficit on that side of the ledger. On the other side, there has been a deterioration, but nothing to the extent that the minister indicated—nothing of that magnitude. The overall picture is still an overall $200 million&amp;hyphen;plus improvement in the total rail deficit picture over those four or five years. National Rail is on track to commercial viability, where it will have no subsidies after five years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister—this gives an indication of what the real story is—was fronting up to the annual general meeting of National Rail only a few weeks ago demanding a $1 million extraordinary dividend out of them. Far from them being in financial strife, the government is trying to milk extra money out of them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government are providing only $20 million of their so-called $2 billion package, which amounts to about one per cent in real expenditure, for regional adjustment. That is about one year's wages bill at Port Augusta.
         <break page="8269" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          It is a drop in the ocean with respect to the economic impact that will occur at Port Augusta. It will not help the loss of heavy engineering capacity in Adelaide. It will not pay for the cost of increased road usage and increased road costs in Tasmania, which will ultimately lead to double the costs. The deficit on Tasrail in the last two years is now at the lowest it has been for 10 years. The last two years in Tasrail have been the best of the last 10 years.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The regional adjustment fund will not cover the road damage that results, it will not cover assistance to inland New South Wales communities that lose their services, and there is no mention anywhere of the fact that the former Labor government's labour market adjustment programs have been abolished, which 1,200 AN workers who were previously retrenched benefited from.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's attack on the record of the former government with respect to jobs is equally fallacious. The loss of jobs in AN in the last 13 years has been mirrored in every rail system in the country for the same reasons—new technology, work practices and improvements in productivity. That is where they have come from. Citing examples of New Zealand and other countries around the world to justify what the minister is doing is equally ludicrous. New Zealand Rail does well because road charges are three or four times higher than they are in Australia, so the playing field is radically different.

         If you look around the world, you see, for example, Amtrak in the United States.

Rail throughout the world is subsidised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key thing in all of this is a minister who is economical with the truth. He has tried to claim that Labor's actions led to his decision to sell off AN. He has tried to claim that the losses AN are incurring for 1995-96 are $250 million when they are in fact way below that. And he said on TV that this will not necessarily mean job losses when he was telling the workers the direct opposite.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is a pattern that is recurring throughout the minister's statements because he likes to leave out key facts when it suits him. He is very well named, not because he is sharp as in intelligent, not because he is sharp as in bright, but because he is sharp as in practices, sharp as in conduct, sharp as in card sharp.

          This privatisation plan is purely ideological. It is designed to get rid of a subsidy on the budget. It is designed to get the government out of the rail industry. It is based on one year's bad figures that are nowhere near as bad as the government suggests and it is based on a secret report that the government refuses to release. The Labor Party will fight this all the way in the Senate and in the Senate committee.

        It has been fascinating. We have had two weeks, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) points out, for the Labor Party to mount their withering attack on this particular subject. Indeed, we have had to ask ourselves questions on this very subject in order to get up in the House. There was only one question from the Labor Party in the whole of this fortnight whereupon they asked about the AN reforms.

        It took us, on behalf of the government, to ask questions of ourselves to get the issue up in the parliament in the first place.

         —I spoke to some people who worked for AN just the other day in Adelaide. Indeed, it was a most illuminating exercise. The first thing they say to me is that the reason AN is in the problem it is in today is the previous Labor government's decision to set up the National Rail Corporation the way it did.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason they say that is that when the National Rail Corporation was set up in the early 1990s National Rail was given two&amp;hyphen;thirds of AN's business. AN had to give it a lot of its rolling stock, locomotives and other equipment free of charge. AN had to give over two&amp;hyphen;thirds of its business to the National Rail Corporation—plus its locos, plus its rolling stock, plus a lot of other assets—without any charge or cost going to NR and without any revenue coming to AN.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        AN was left with the debt on those locos, the debt on that rolling stock, the debt on the assets that they handed over. So NR got the revenue from all of this equipment and AN had to pay the bill. NR got two&amp;hyphen;thirds of AN's business and AN was left with all the infrastructure and costs to bear. That is the thing that people who work for AN say was the problem they had to work with, a problem created by the previous Labor government. That is why this is a very embarrassing issue for Labor. AN's death knell was struck with the foundation of the National Rail Corporation by the previous Labor government. That is why this is embarrassing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also embarrassing for the Labor Party because during its time in office 7,000 people who worked for AN lost their jobs. Here we are today dealing with an MPI in which the Labor Party is railing about the possible loss
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of jobs within AN, yet 7,000 jobs were lost at AN during the 13 years of a Labor government—under Labor's management.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne he said, `Those job losses? They were good job losses because that is what everybody else was doing. Any job losses in the future will obviously be bad.' I can assure the House that there will not be anything like those sorts of job losses in AN or NR in the future, because it is this government's proposal to grow those businesses, to make them more efficient and to reduce the debt load, the debt burden, that those businesses have had to suffer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very interesting to consider what the previous Labor government could have done, had they chosen to try to fix the problems of AN. AN's problem was that it lumbered with enormous debts, debts that have a commercial value of around $1,100 million. AN had to pay the bill for those debts. That was one of the major problems that AN suffered from. What this government has done is exactly what the PTU representatives asked us to do when we discussed these matters with them. The PTU representatives said, `If there is one thing you can do for AN, it is to relieve it of its debts. If you relieve AN of its debts, then AN's problems will be, to a fair degree, resolved because it is the debt that weighs us down so much.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result of our announcement on rail reform, this new coalition government will be removing all of the debts and liabilities of AN: taking over its debt, paying out any possible redundancy commitments that are within the labour force at AN, paying out all of the superannuation commitments within AN and dealing with all of the environmental problems—if they are tidied up properly, to the value of about $50 million. We are taking over all of the debts and liabilities of AN in order to ensure that AN, under a new owner, has a real future.

        This is something that the previous Labor government could have done. They could have done precisely that, if they had wanted to fix the problems of AN, but they chose not to do it during their 13 years of office. Instead, what the previous Labor government
        <break page="8271" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         chose to do was to mislead the people who work for AN, as they did in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the last election when the former Minister for Transport and the former Prime Minister visited the workshops at AN and told them that everything was sweet, everything was hunky&amp;hyphen;dory. `Vote for us and you'll have a future,' they said. Well, their business plan that the former Minister for Transport and the former Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), had signed off on had agreed secretly to strike out 972 jobs. In the Labor business plan it had been agreed that 972 jobs had to go, at the very time the Labor Prime Minister and the Labor transport minister were down there telling them that everything was sweet; they had no worries at all.

        I go to a couple of the points that the honourable member for Melbourne made in his withering attack. The PTU, he said, got only 15 minutes with us. That is incorrect. There were several members of our committee there and they had a much longer time than that. They had considerable contact with me and members of the government over the months that led up to that decision. We had consistent contact from the PTU. We listened to their advice and, in many cases, we have accepted their advice.

        The other point that the honourable member for Melbourne made in his address was that the National Rail Corporation is on the road to profitability and it is only a Labor government with its policies that would have seen that happen—or words to that effect. National Rail Corporation is not on the road to profitability. In the September quarter, it was $10.8 million down on its budgeted revenues.The chief executive officer at the time of announcing the September quarter results said that revenue for NR for the whole of the financial year would be something like $45 million to $50 million below budget forecasts.

        Is this a business on its way to profitability? Is this a business that does not depend on government subsidies for its existence? The truth of it is that NR gets $25 million of government subsidies in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. It will get subsidies again in the current financial year. Not only that but NR receives goods and

        The coalition government has announced a $2 billion package to try to resolve the problems of AN and to reform our rail system here in Australia.

        The one and only question I can recall being asked by the member for Melbourne in the last fortnight was about whether there would be a guarantee of the maintenance of passenger and freight services. It is interesting to note Labor's track record on maintaining passenger and freight services during their 13 years of office when they had the management of AN. A long list of services was axed under their management. For example, passenger services: Adelaide to Victor Harbor—axed; Adelaide to Peterborough—axed; Adelaide to Broken Hill—axed; Adelaide to

         —Labor did that during their 13 years of office, their 13 years of mismanagement. Let us see what happened with the freight services that AN operated during the 13 years of a Labor government. Services were withdrawn from rail lines to Mount Gambier, Loxton and Kapunda. In Tasmania, freight services were axed on the Mole Creek line and the Tonganah line.

So Labor Party people have no credibility when get up on their feet and talk about possible job losses or reductions in passenger or freight services or closure of lines at AN and NR—because nobody has done it more than they did during their 13 years in office.

If I could find them, I would read them out to you but I do not have them with me now.

        So this government is proposing to give rail a real future. We believe that by bringing private sector investment into the rail system, as has been the case in a lot of other countries, rail will grow here in Australia. By setting up a national network of rail lines connecting our capital cities and allowing the private sector to operate on it, we believe there will be more freight on our rail system and, ultimately, more passengers than we have seen in the past. Evidence of that was just 48 hours ago when TNT and Toll Holdings agreed to a joint venture to put more freight onto rail under this government's initiatives.

        Railways have also been vital for the defence of our country. It is worth noting that it is only Labor which has provided a real and significant possibility for the Alice Springs to Darwin link, which not only has substantial advantages in trade in this country and for South Australia and the Northern Territory but also provides a real link to the north of Australia for the defence of Australia. The role of railways in the development of this country, be it trading or entrepreneurial activity, manufacturing, mining, agriculture or defence, has always been vital in all of those areas of national development.

        But while the times and the economies of scale and the technology and working practices in rail have changed, the whole notion of our rail network has had to change too. It continues to perform the same vital functions that it performed a century ago in the national development of Australia and which it will always perform in countries like this. But the last few decades have seen the rail system under some threat from the competition for passengers from the airline industry and the road transport industry which has sought to take freight and to undercut the rail system in Australia—in fact, to undermine the very economic basis of that rail network.

        Prime Minister Fraser did not continue this good work. Indeed, it was during this period that much of the foundation for our current problems was laid. For example, in the final year of the Fraser government, when another National Party minister held the position of Minister for Transport, the current value of the debt—if you look at the debt then in current dollar terms—was some $190 million, which certainly is within the ballpark of any current problems being faced by the rail network. It just shows you where much of that debt came from back in the late 1970s and early 1980s during the Fraser years.

I do not claim that all the decisions which were taken during that time were ideal.

        The shadow minister is well noted for his exaggeration of what actually occurs, but one of the more remarkable statements I have heard in recent weeks was when Martin Ferguson visited the electorate. In an interview on the ABC he said, `There have been some job losses.' I remind him that there were actually 7,000 job losses when we had something like 2,000 jobs remaining in AN altogether. He subsequently went on to say that there had been `some job losses', not acknowledging in any way the 7,000 jobs lost.

National Rail is already in trouble. We have intermodal revenue from all origins to Perth down $10.4 million for the quarter—that is 27 per cent—and the announcement by TNT.

          —by leave—The first report which I have tabled concerns proposed facilities at RAAF Base Townsville for 5 Aviation Regiment. The proposed works examined by the committee encompass two major elements. The first is the construction of an advanced wash facility and environmental shelters equipped with dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. This will reduce corrosion caused by operation and open storage of the helicopters in salt laden atmospheric conditions. The shelters will also reduce exposure of the helicopters to high temperatures and ultraviolet radiation and will alleviate occupational health and safety problems associated with personnel working on the helicopters in the tropical sun.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second is the relocation of 5 Aviation Regiment's transport and vehicle workshop facilities within the existing regimental precinct to enhance operational efficiency. Ancillary works involving the refurbishment of a helicopter arming area are also included. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed works is $21.332 million. The committee has recommended that the project proceed as planned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report concludes that Black Hawk helicopters operated by 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville have experienced unexpectedly high rates of corrosion. This has been attributed to the use of high strength, lightweight alloys in helicopter structures and the operation and storage of aircraft in humid and salt laden atmospheric conditions. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation has affected internal electronic components and plastic fittings.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In response to questions from members, the Department of Defence advised the committee that development of the proposed work commenced 12 months before the tragic Black Hawk accident and that it is not linked in any way to the crash. RAAF Base Townsville remains the preferred location of 5 Aviation Regiment due to the proximity of 3 Brigade and impracticalities and considerable investment associated with alternative locations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          High corrosion rates have diminished the capacity to operate the helicopters through to life of type planned for 2015 as well as affecting aircraft serviceability and requiring expenditure on maintenance, with associated costs expected to exceed sustainable funding levels. The Department of Defence has implemented a corrosion control program for the helicopters to permit 5 Aviation Regiment's Black Hawk helicopters to operate effectively through to life of type.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To satisfy the requirements of the corrosion control program, there is a need to provide environmental protection shelters serviced by dehumidification equipment and an enclosed helicopter washing facility. Based on the number of Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters operated by 5 Aviation Regiment and current maintenance programs, there is a requirement for 19 Black Hawk and four Chinook shelters.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Department of Defence estimates that cost of environmental protection shelters would be recovered after two years, based on the $1.5 million cost of corrosion control undertaken in 1995 on four helicopters. With regard to the need for improved arrangements for vehicles and workshops, the committee has concluded that existing transport and some technical workshop facilities are located at inappropriately remote sites from 5 Aviation Regiment's precinct at RAAF Base Townsville. The facilities are inadequate and their locations present an ongoing cost to unit efficiency. There is also a need to relocate 5 Aviation Regiment's small arms repair section and to refurbish the gunship helicopter arming point.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The report concludes that the proposed environmental protection shelters, the provision of dehumidification equipment and the
          <break page="8278" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           helicopter wash facility can be justified as providing the necessary facilities for the successful and economic implementation of the corrosion control plan.
           <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
            The scope of works for the transport compound and workshop facilities can be justified on the basis of considerably improved working conditions, improved shelter and security for the extensive fleet of vehicles and resulting improved efficiency.

          The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of infrastructure on Townsville field training area, Townsville. By way of background, the proposal will enable the army and the RAAF to effectively utilise a large training area encompassing more than 230,000 hectares and to ease environmental pressures on the high range training area.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Broadly, the proposal will provide: fences and warning signs; office accommodation for the range control organisation; communication facilities; access roads; basic infrastructure for a 350&amp;hyphen;man camp; vehicle crossing points for creeks, roads and railways; and vehicle wash points. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work was $18.694 million.

          As part of the committee's inquiry, members were able to fly over this extensive tract of land in two Black Hawk helicopters to inspect the extent of the training area and the sites for various components of the proposed work. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.

          The report concludes that a need exists to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable elements of the Australian Defence Force to undertake collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre, at brigade level, in the Townsville field training area.

        This is the second of two bills containing veterans' affairs 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget measures. The first bill contained budget initiatives that will take effect earlier than the measures in this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I introduced the first bill, I mentioned various budget and other initiatives that were important to the health and wellbeing of veterans and their families, but did not require legislation. I want to take the opportunity now to refer to another significant veterans' affairs budget initiative that will increase the general community appreciation of the sacrifices and the contribution made by the veterans of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to benefits and services provided directly to veterans and their families, the government recognises the importance of developing the community's knowledge and understanding of veterans' war experiences and the contribution of veterans to the development of the Australian identity over the past 100 years. In this year's budget, the government committed funding for a four&amp;hyphen;year
        <break page="8279" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         program of commemorative activities. This program will publicly and proudly honour the debt owed by all Australians to our veteran community through a range of programs of commemoration and education, and through the restoration of important memorials.

          I turn now to the content of this bill.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           The main thrust of this bill is the rationalisation of payments between my department and the Department of Social Security. This reflects the government's commitment to administrative reforms to streamline the delivery of government services.

        The bill will allow age pensioners, who also receive a disability pension, to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans, and their eligible partners, it will mean that they need deal with only one department. I want to stress that this arrangement will not affect the eligibility for a service pension. There will be a continuing requirement for a veteran to have qualifying service to be paid a service pension.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new arrangement will simplify payments to, and communication with, veterans who do not have qualifying service and who receive an age pension and a disability pension. The popular support for a concept like this was demonstrated last year when most war widows, who also received a social security pension, opted to receive all payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another administrative reform flowing from this bill is the centralisation of payments to carers. From 1 July 1997, the Department of Social Security will have responsibility for all carer payments. Carers who have received Veterans' Affairs payments will be automatically transferred to the Department of Social Security's carer payment. A small number of carers, who could be disadvantaged or temporarily inconvenienced by the transfer, will continue to be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Other changes in this bill relate to the better targeting of income support benefits. The first of these address the relative economies single people can obtain from sharing the cost of rental accommodation. Two people in this
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         situation can now receive more rent assistance than a pensioner couple, even if their combined financial circumstances are the same. This bill will address that anomaly. Single people who share rented accommodation will be paid less rent assistance than they would receive if they did not share. There are some shared rent situations, such as for single people who have dependent children and for people in nursing homes, where the pensioner gains no advantage. The new arrangements will not apply in these situations.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill also discontinues the `saved' eligibility for fringe benefits of a group of former service pensioners. These are people who would have lost eligibility for fringe benefits as a result of the introduction of deemed income in 1991. All service pensioners later became eligible for fringe benefits and many of those whose eligibility for fringe benefits had been `saved' a few years earlier could again qualify without the help of the `savings' provisions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The people who will be affected by the changes in this bill are those whose income has been in excess of the pension limits for the past four years. There is no justification to continue to allow these people to enjoy the broad range of fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth and the community for the assistance of those in greater financial need.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government remains committed to maintaining existing veterans' entitlements. Benefits and services need to be reviewed to maintain their quality, fairness and appropriateness. The government is also committed to improving efficiency in the delivery of these benefits and services. The outcome will be a system that is responsive to the changing needs of veterans and their families, and one that directs resources to the greatest needs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion: this is a bill that reflects the government's intent to achieve greater efficiency in the delivery of services and fairness in the benefits it provides to veterans and their families. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

         —It is very interesting that we find it necessary in this parliament to debate a bill of this type. The fact is that the Flags Amendment Bill would never have been introduced if there had been absolute certainty amongst members of the parliament and the Australian public that there was no intention ever to change the Australian flag. It was only during the period of the last government that on a number of occasions, which began in 1984, it was necessary for members of the then opposition to constantly remind the parliament and the Australian people that we had a flag that was captive purely to an act of parliament and not to the constitution itself, a flag that was captive to the whims and the balance of numbers in this place and in the Senate.

        So there were circumstances where uncertainty of the future of the Australian flag started to arise, and it was fostered, I would have to say, both by former Prime Minister Keating and by his predecessor, Bob Hawke. So there were hints, innuendos and some straight statements from time to time which aroused great concern amongst sections of the Australian community and amongst the majority of Australians that their flag, something they had grown up with, something they respected and honoured, was going to be changed at the whim of a parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said, from 1984 there were moves in this parliament and in the Senate—as recently as 1994 by Senator Parer, who brought in a private member's bill in the Senate—to ensure that, firstly, the Australian people were conscious that the Australian flag could be changed by an act of parliament and, secondly, the sophistry of the Australian Labor Party was fully exposed. It seemed to us on this side of the House during that period when the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, went on foreign junkets or foreign travel that he wanted to raise and talk about nothing more significant than the Australian flag or the need for Australia to become a republic.

President Suharto, in my opinion, would have been most impressed with a leader who thought so little of his own constitution, his flag and his country's symbols when the first thing that leader did when travelling overseas was to criticise and denigrate those very symbols!

Bob Hawke was a bit rough and a bit of a larrikin in his own way, but he was liked by Australians. They thought he was a knockabout Aussie and not a bad sort of fellow. He was not the sort of man who would come into this parliament and snooze. He would enliven the place. He would set it on end. I cannot imagine Bob Hawke, even today in his advancing years, going to sleep on any public occasion, because he with his wife would want to embellish and improve upon the environment where they were. But that is not the case with every member of the Labor Party. Members only have to look around them to know that Bob Hawke's standards are not the standards of the House today.

         Hence, the Flags Amendment Bill that we are debating today has become a necessity for the future of Australia. This issue has been raised three or four times from 1984 until last year, but with the change of government has come our commitment. When in opposition we said that we would, on coming to government, pass an act of parliament which would make it compulsory for the Australian government—unless they wished to be law&amp;hyphen;breakers and become illegal in their method of operation—to go to the Australian people with a referendum to decide the future of our flag.

         I include that qualification, because a future government wanting to change the flag would have to be a law-breaker. It would be possible for a future government to say, `We're going to ignore this act of parliament or we're going to amend it, so we don't have to go to a referendum and consult the people.' That is certainly true, but they will have to break a law or change a law to do so.

         When it comes to the question of unity, it was because of the sense of unity already there, that the Australian States federated. Had Keating read much of the diaries and letters of the men of the A.I.F. he would have learnt that they had an intense feeling of Australian nationalism and a pride in it. It is significant that their pride, which with most Australians today lies in the achievements of our sporting greats, was in themselves and their achievements fighting for their country as Australians. My father's own Great War diaries and letters are bound with expressions that the AIF hoped to bring credit to Australia as a nation. On Gallipoli he wrote, "Thank God Australia breeds such heroes".

         I want to conclude my remarks by referring to the flag and what it means for the future of this nation. If we look at the elements of the flag and the symbolism of the flag rather than the precise details of the flag, then we start to appreciate what an inheritance we have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at the Union Jack, we have to appreciate that there are only about 14 or 15 absolutely free democratic nations on earth.
         <break page="8283" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Australia is fortunate to be one of those. In the United Nations scale of ranking of freedoms, if you can devise such a process, Australia is the third freest nation on earth. There are a couple ahead of us, but we have a freedom that I believe is inherited by the parliamentary system that we have and the freedom of the courts from interference by the political process. So the right of a person to go before a court as an innocent individual is a very significant feature of Australian society.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In many courts of the world, people are confronted by an adversarial court system where they go before the court  guilty and must prove themselves innocent. Our system is quite different to that, and it is a valuable freedom that we have. I believe that those two features of parliamentary democracy and the freedom of the courts stem from our British inheritance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, the flag carries the symbol of the Southern Cross, claimed by republicans to be the symbol of republicanism. But I reject that concept. The miners at Eureka were typical Aussies. They told the government to get out of the way and get off their backs. The Australian people told the opposition some years ago that they did not want a GST. I think the fervent nature of Australians in their disregard for authority and government is an endearing character that we inherited and it is something that we should be proud of. No government in Australia will get too big for its boots while we have Australians with an attitude of dismissiveness towards authority and those people who want to preen or to promote authority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is my view that the inheritance of the Southern Cross is that of a typical Australian symbol, one that says that we are not overawed by authority. It is a matter where people look to an egalitarian society where there is equality of opportunity and where people seek the best by their own attributes and attitudes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, the third symbol of the Australian flag is the federal or Commonwealth star which symbolises the states and territories of this nation. The symbolism of one star representing the whole nation is in fact a symbol of unity and the need for this nation to work
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          together as a people if they wish to have achievements.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, in the symbolism of our flag, if you are thinking of symbolism for the future of this nation, we would have to say that we need and must cling to those inherited values of freedom, the parliamentary process and the significance of our court system, because they very much underpin our very society. The individuality of Australians is a very important characteristic, as is the capacity for us as a nation not to be overawed by government or those in authority but to be able to stand up for our own rights as individuals and as is the need for us as a nation to be able to work together if we want to achieve things.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the symbolism of the flag has stood us in good stead in the past and it would be very difficult to replace it with another flag of similar significance. So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. I know that the bill will go through this parliament. I hope it will become an act of this parliament. I hope that future generations will value the contribution of members of this House as much as we can value the contributions of those who have gone before who have pointed out to us the way in which we need to revere and adhere to the principles and symbolisms that our flag stands for, because our flag does represent our nation.

         As the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), said, it shows the Southern Cross, which represents where we are in the world. It shows our unity as a nation with the federation star and the Union Jack. The Union Jack is not only about where we have come from and where our roots are—I am not too sure that others have alluded to it in this debate—but also the compilation of three other flags, they being the three Christian flags of St George, St Patrick and St Andrew.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also says something about what we are as a nation. When we fill out our census forms the overwhelming majority of Australians today still refer to themselves as Christians. It says where we are in the world geographically, the fact that we are unified, the fact that we are all together as one, and it says a little about where we have come from. The flag crosses all boundaries, whether you are black, white or brindle. It crosses your demographic and social boundaries. It is all&amp;hyphen;encompassing. That is why I embrace the Australian flag.

         This bill today is not about whether I like the Australian flag or whether I want to see it changed, as some in this House obviously do. It is about whether or not one person or any one organisation should be able to change that flag without first relating that back to the people in the form of a plebiscite, a vote of the people.

         A symbol as important as our flag certainly deserves the consideration of the nation as a whole before it is changed.

          part of 100 years. It is also important for people to remember that we have only been a nation for less than 100 years. Whilst white Australians have been in this place for over 200 years, we have only been a nation—one Australian people—since the turn of the century. When we go into the next millennium, we must ask ourselves whether we are going to allow the will of just a few people or one or two organisations to determine the future of our pre&amp;hyphen;eminent symbol of this nation.

         I would like to turn to a couple of the comments that have been made by those opposite in regard to our current flag. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) pointed out to us that when he is overseas and people run the New Zealand flag up the flagpole he is embarrassed because they have mistaken the New Zealand flag for the Australian flag. I would suggest to him that it is not something to be embarrassed about. Perhaps those that have run up the flag have shown their ignorance and they should be embarrassed. I certainly am not. Are we to change our name from Australia because Austria has been around for a lot longer than us and we have been mistaken before for Austria and people have used the wrong national anthem? It really does not follow.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have our national symbols. We have our national floral symbols and emblems and we have a national flag. It is not until it becomes the will of the overwhelming majority of Australians which can be reflected in the form of a vote that this parliament should ever elect to change it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One member opposite mentioned that the flag does not encompass the Aboriginals and that they now have their own flag and that perhaps the Union Jack should be removed out of the corner of our current flag and be replaced by the Aboriginal flag. But the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) rightly pointed out that the Aboriginals have never recognised a symbol such as a flag for the thousands of years they have occupied this country. The fact is that the Aboriginals have never been one nation. They have been an enormous different number of nations living on the one continent. They now all live
         <break page="8285" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          under—and always have done—the Southern Cross. So why wouldn't they feel just as represented with this flag we currently have?

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many of the elders of the Aboriginal community do not recognise the flag that is purported to be that of the Aboriginal people. Therefore, some person's opinion in this place that it would be a good idea to replace the Union Jack with the Aboriginal flag would be quite unrepresentative not only of the many migrants in this country but also of many of the Aboriginal people. I do not think it is for us to be judging what changes should be made. My views, as I pointed out earlier on and as I show by the fact that I wear the Australian flag today, are quite obvious. It does not mean that my views are any more representative or any better than those of any other person in this place or throughout this nation. Therefore, I feel that the only way we can ever determine a change to the Australian flag is to have the views of everybody considered. I will never be in a position of pushing my thoughts down their throats.

         Questions were also asked today as to why we are having the debate this week and why we are having the debate at all. One of these points was canvassed by the previous speaker, the Chief Government Whip, when he said, quite rightly, that under normal circumstances there should be no good reason why we would need to have this debate, other than that Australians were fearful that those who would undermine our symbols, and who took direct steps to do that, would remove Australia's No. 1 symbol from them without their having a say. Therefore in opposition we put forward the policy that we would encompass the views of Australians when and if ever the Australian people elect to change this symbol.

          I think that is a great step forward. But it shows the ignorance, the arrogance and the lack of ability to listen of those opposite in the previous parliament. I might add that I am not referring to all of those present today or all of those in this parliament, the 38th Parliament, but certainly to a good number of those. That is probably one of the reasons why—because they misrepresented the Aus tralian population so badly—so few of them remain here now.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As to having the debate this week, it was put earlier today that this debate was no more than a filler. What an interesting day of filling we have had! The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made a speech to the parliament on the achievements of the Howard government. Of course, there have been many achievements in the short period that we have been in government. A day on which the Prime Minister elects to speak to the Australian people and to the parliament about the first nine months of the Howard government is certainly a day on which I am more than happy to stand in this place and talk about the Australian flag.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also a very important day for many Australians because it is the day on which, yet again, we have seen a further cut in interest rates, which will be welcomed by Australian families, as they also welcome the news that their flag will have security because of this legislation. So there are many good reasons why this day—and this week—is a very good and appropriate time to debate this question so that we, the people's house of the Australian parliament, ensure that the question of whether the Australian flag is changed remains a decision for all Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A point made by some of those opposite is that this legislation can be changed. They are 100 per cent correct. Any legislation can be changed; we know that. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if under the previous regime this legislation had been in place and they had intended to push ahead with their thoughts of changing the Australian flag, the first step they would have had to take would have been to have a vote or, at the very least, change the legislation in this parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that would be somewhat telegraphing your punches, and the people who have now formed the Australian Flag Association around this nation, who feel very strongly about maintaining this as our national flag for many years to come, would have been mobilised very quickly to ensure that the wider community was aware of what was afoot. That is what this legislation is about. It is
         <break page="8286" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          about involving all Australians in determining their future.

         Next year, we will no doubt see a debate on whether we will become a republic. Once again, rather than dominating the debate, we will see the Prime Minister and the government taking a leading hand in the debate but not directing it, not enforcing their will upon others. That is very much why this legislation has been framed in its current form.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was also suggested that this piece of legislation and the whole flag debate really did not need to be debated at all, that it was not really important, that the economy was important. You are right: the economy is very important. We are seeing massive changes and improvements to the economy as this government grows in stature, as we see interest rates, as I said earlier, coming down, as we see tax cuts being delivered to the average family household on 1 January, and as we see the industrial relations reforms coming into place. But the symbols are still important and people like to have that security.

         Many members who have spoken before me are active in their own communities, particularly with the veterans. I am as well, as a member of the Bribie Island RSL Club, as a former member of the defence forces and the Vietnam Veterans Association. These people are just a small part of the community who feel very dearly about our current flag. They would see themselves as being absolutely betrayed if this flag were changed, after the sacrifices they have made. If that becomes the will of the people, I am sure they will be willing to accept that. But they will not be willing to accept the views of a very small minority who want to force their opinions upon the wider community; and nor should they.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I reiterate that this bill is not just about my preference, the preference of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) or any other member of this parliament. It is about the preference of the wider community. These questions, which are about who we are as a people and the symbols that we put forward, should rightly be debated throughout the Australian community, and people should
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          have an input. But they should always be secure in the knowledge that there is legislation in place by a responsible government, that their rights to their opinions and to the changing of their national symbols will be safeguarded.

         Recently, the post office on Bribie Island in my electorate pulled down the Australian flag. I received numerous calls. There were letters to the editor and articles in the local paper. It created an interest in the community because they looked to that symbol as they went about their daily business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On a positive note, more Australians in that area have now chosen to fly the Australian flag in their own backyards. I believe in this form of patriotism. I believe in showing that you are proud of your country and your nation's symbols. I believe that this Australian flag, as it currently stands, will fly over this parliament and this nation for many years to come.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It will only be once the Australian public has spoken in overwhelming numbers that we will change our symbols or our form of government. This legislation will ensure that those safeguards are in place. I commend the bill to the House.

         —I have listened with great interest this afternoon to the comments of a dozen or so honourable members who have spoken before me in this debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. Obviously, when one takes into consideration the brevity of the bill it is very interesting to hear the different concepts and philosophies that people have about our national emblem. I support the Flags Amendments Bill which will ensure the protection of our national flag. The purpose of this bill is to amend the 1953 act to ensure that the only way the flag can be replaced is if a majority of electors in each state and territory agree to the change.

        If we look at the history of our national flag, we find that we had our first flag in 1788—and we have heard many speakers refer to this this afternoon. In 1876, the flag of New South Wales became a very important emblem for the Australian continent. In 1901, the Commonwealth decided to hold a design competition for two flags—one for official
        <break page="8287" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and naval purposes and the other for merchant ships. My understanding from reading some of the history of that competition is that the prize was put up by a tobacco company.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1902, Edward VII approved the design which comprised the blue ensign, the Union Jack, the federation star and the Southern Cross on a blue background. For 50 years, both flags were used on land and sea. It was not until the passing of the Flags Act 1953 that the Commonwealth blue ensign became the official national flag. Today, the Australian flags of the original states of the Federation have the Union Jack as part of their designs, but the new flags adopted by the territories do not.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I will talk about the Northern Territory flag for a moment. It has the stars of the Southern Cross as part of its design. The colours on the flag are white, black and ochre. The white and black represent the people of the Northern Territory and the ochre represents the colour of the earth in the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1902, the national flag had on it a sixpointed star—the federation star. In 1908, the star was changed to have seven points—six points for the states and the seventh point representing the territories. In my eyes, the template of the national flag is one of multicultural design. Some members were quite surprised when I brought it to their attention that the stars of the Southern Cross were named after letters in the Greek alphabet. Did you did know that?

The Southern Cross, which has been a symbol of our region, was obviously named many centuries ago by Greek astronomers. I tried to develop a further line on that, but, unfortunately, I ran out of time. The template of the Australian flag and the red ensign are quite clearly referred to in a book I have with me, so that cannot be disputed.

        This afternoon, I heard members talk about the flag of St Andrew, the flag of St George and the flag of St Patrick. I was told by a colleague when I was in the United Kingdom some years ago that St Andrew, who is the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         patron saint of Scotland, was a Greek. That astounds quite a number of my Scottish friends. Apparently it is true. St Andrew's bones were found floating around the North Sea about seven centuries ago. It is certainly very interesting when you delve into the history of the flag. Flags certainly have a lot of history.

        A flag expresses one's pride. Members who have spoken in this debate this afternoon, and the Australian community, have expressed a great deal of pride in our national flag. The time when we have a great deal of pride is when the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games are on and an Australian wins an event and the Australian flag goes up and the Australian anthem is played. Australians, as well as the successful competitor, feel a great deal of pride at that time.

        An Australia blue ensign was raised in Singapore when the Japanese surrender was announced in 1945. This flag had been made secretly by Australian prisoners of war, who stitched a small Union Jack that had escaped the notice of the Japanese guards onto a piece of blue material obtained from Japanese stores. White handkerchiefs from Red Cross parcels made up the stars. The flag was raised over the `X3' working camp at Bukit Panjang and later over the Australian Imperial Forces' headquarters at Changi. This flag is among the many historic flags that are preserved at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

         Throughout the world, in conflict and in joy, the Australian national flag is very well respected and, as I said, a lot of people have a lot of pride in it. I for one do support the amending bill moved by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) to ensure that, if the flag is ever going to be changed for any reason, the matter comes back to the parliament. If the parliament cannot decide that the changes are necessary, then I would accept the recommendation that has been made by other members of this House that maybe a referendum should be held on the matter.

         It is a very deep&amp;hyphen;rooted part of Australia's history. We are a country that is just over 200 years old. Other countries throughout the Commonwealth are 400 and 500 years old and steeped in history. If we are going to leave a legacy to our children, then I believe that we must make a firm stand now. That is what I believe the coalition is doing. In the past few years, there has been discussion and debate on the probability of our national flag being changed or even being got rid of.

         As you know, I am of ethnic, of Greek, origin. The Union Jack really does not have a great deal of symbolic realism to me. But being born in Australia and being an Australian, having the Union Jack on the flag certainly does symbolise the true heritage of this country. It is for that reason that I would fight tooth and nail to make sure that, if the flag was ever going to be changed, it would be changed only by the will of the Australian community. With those words, I have no hesitation in supporting the amending bill moved by the minister.

         —I believe I am in a unique position in this debate on the Flags Amendment Bill in the House today in that I am the only member of the House who has actually spoken on the issue in both chambers. In 1984, the opposition introduced the Flags Amendment Bill into the Senate and the second reading was moved in September. The debate on it took place in October. Unfortunately, I did not get to vote on it there. The debate was adjourned and was not resumed until February 1985

        I have often said to people that the first lesson of politics is patience. I think that possibly the Flags Amendment Bill is a very good example of that. The bill did pass the Senate in February 1985, as I have said, and was subsequently introduced into this House in 1985 by the gentleman who is now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We have waited a long time to debate it in this House. For a number of reasons, I am very pleased to still be here—

         —Thank you—and have the opportunity to debate and vote on it again. National symbols are a subject in which I have taken a very longstanding interest—national symbols including the flag but not exclusively about the flag—and I find that, whilst the flag is something that many people in the community hold passionate views on, many of them are really very badly informed about it. It was no coincidence that the basic flag design that we have today was submitted by four individuals in response to the competition that was run to choose a national flag back at the end of the 19th century.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a matter of record that four people submitted the same design and shared the prize and that a few years later that design was slightly modified by the addition of the seven&amp;hyphen;pointed federation star underneath the Union Jack. I say it is no coincidence that four people submitted an identical design because that design had been in wide usage well before the competition was run.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first example of that design that I have been able to identify goes back to an organisation called the Australasian Anti&amp;hyphen;Transportation League which in the 1850s adopted that design as its symbol, the differences, of course, being that the federation star was not on it and the stars of the Southern Cross were in gold. But in all other respects the design was the same as the one that won the competition for the new Australian flag.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is particularly appropriate that our present flag originated from that organisation because it was the anti&amp;hyphen;transportation movement which
        <break page="8289" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         was the beginnings of an organised voice amongst people then living in what were British colonies—some of them semi self&amp;hyphen;governing, others not—towards a new democratic free nation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The anti&amp;hyphen;transportation movement had as its objective stopping the transportation of convicts from England to Australia because those who were behind the movement recognised that Australia could never be free and self&amp;hyphen; governing, could never be anything other than a colony, for as long as it was a repository for English convicts. So in the 1850s the Australasian Anti&amp;hyphen;Transportation League adopted that basic design of the Union Jack and the Southern Cross. It is worth putting on record that our present flag has that very longstanding link with the very beginnings of the democratic self&amp;hyphen; government process in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A flag is the most important national symbol that a country has. It is the symbol that a country chooses to represent itself to the rest of the world. Therefore, it is something that should not be lightly adopted or rejected. It should not be lightly changed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have no difficulty at all with the present design of the flag—in fact I like it—as a symbol of modern Australia. One of the great beauties of the flag and its symbolism is that it is a growing symbolism; it is one that extends itself over the decades. It probably had a very significant meaning back in 1850, had a slightly different meaning in 1901 and it again has a new meaning in Australia at the end of the 20th century.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Often, like other members, I have presented flags at schools and, in so doing, attempted to explain to quite young people the significance of the symbolism. On the subject of the Southern Cross, I say to them that it was like a signpost in the early days when the early explorers realised that there was a continent in the southern hemisphere. In the early days of discovery of the Australian continent and in its early days of settlement, those who came here used sailing ships and had none of our modern navigational aids. It was by the Southern Cross that they found their way to Australia.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Southern Cross was a constellation visible only in the southern hemisphere. Over time, sailors and navigators of those sailing ships realised that once they could sight the Southern Cross in the heavens, then they could find a bearing for Australia. So the Southern Cross became a signpost to this new country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the great things about our very special nation is that we are still a young nation and we remain young by the continued evolution of a new society. In recent times there has been a lot of debate—which I do not intend to re&amp;hyphen;visit here today—on the subject of immigration to Australia. Since the end of the Second World War, with the great waves of immigrants and refugees who came to Australia in the late 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s, Australia changed and became yet another new nation, different in many respects from the one that existed up until the end of the 1930s.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since the late 1970s, we have again taken a new direction socially and culturally as a result of immigration. But the core values of this country have remained the same. Those core values find their origin in those who initially settled this country and then worked to make it a self&amp;hyphen;governing democracy. So all the symbols on the flag are to me today as relevant as they would have been to the new Australians of the new nation of Australia in 1901.

          —Art was never my best subject. From time to time it was relevant to include—in whatever topic our teacher had given us to invent a drawing of—a depiction of the Australian flag. I remember that I was never really sure from the first day the blue ensign went up the pole just what my flag was. So what I used to do was have two bob each way. If I had to do a drawing of something that included the flag, I would look back through my art book to see what colour I had done it the previous time. If it was blue that time, then this time I would do it red, then the next time I would do it blue and so on. I think I was probably hoping that my art teacher would tell me what was right and what was wrong. But I never was corrected.

         The sadness of it is that our teachers did not know why the colour of the flag changed either. It changed, if you look at those debates on the Flag Bill 1953, because there was confusion as to whether the national flag was a blue ensign or a red ensign. In fact, both were our flags prior to the Flags Act being passed.

         One of the things the Flags Act did was to make the red ensign henceforth exclusively the flag of the merchant navy and the blue ensign exclusively the national flag. Both coloured flags were in common usage. The

          reason we had a red ensign at school was that it was commonly used at schools. The reason a blue ensign went up one fine day was that the then government distributed to all schools in Australia blue ensigns to replace the red ensign, which then became exclusively the flag of the merchant navy.

         There has been some controversy on that subject with an organisation called the Australian National Flag Association. On one occasion in Queensland I got into a fairly unseemly argument with one Dr Rupert Goodman on that subject. I knew I was right and he was wrong. His view was that a lot of flags were stolen. The reason that some people were flying red flags was they had actually stolen them from the merchant navy. I found it fairly implausible that all the schools in Queensland, my home state, were flying stolen flags. I mention as an aside that I had attended quite a number of schools throughout Queensland because my father happened to be in a job which led him to frequent transfer. I attended a lot of schools throughout Queensland. They all flew the red flag prior to this event of the blue flag.

         It was only walking through the corridors of Parliament House one day that I got my proof about the common usage of the red ensign.

It was a painting of a very famous picture of the opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament House—what we now refer to as the old Parliament House.

         There was also a photograph of the Duke of York arriving to perform the opening. The photograph is in black and white.

There were equal numbers of the Union Jack flying. There was a contemporary painting done at the time. All depictions of the Australian flag in that painting are of the red ensign. I take it that the artist saw what he was painting and then copied the photograph.

          there was a display in the foyer of the old Parliament House for the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Parliament House. That display included a new painting of that photograph. Every Australian flag in that new painting was a blue ensign. That is quite wrong. I think that painting was especially commissioned by the National Library. It is now its property. But I want the world to know it is wrong. The original painting in the old Parliament House is the one that is historically correct. That is a fairly major digression in time from what we are debating now.

         I return to the beginning of my speech and to that original debate that was held in the Senate on which eventually there was a vote taken in early 1985. By that time I was no longer a senator, I was a member of the House of Representatives. I spoke in the debate on the Flags Bill in the Senate in October 1984 when I was still a senator for Queensland. I regret that I did not get to vote on the bill there.

         I put on the record there was only one government senator who spoke in the Senate debate, and that was Senator Grimes who was then the deputy leader of the government. He was dismissive of the entire debate and said that it was all a waste of time. Nevertheless, there was a concern in those days about some actions that were being taken in relation to national symbols. Part of the concern was the Labor Party's own fault because, whenever you asked whether it was the government's intention to change the flag, you could never get a straight answer.

         Throughout all the debate, queries and questions raised in recent years, including in this chamber, about the possibility of Australia becoming a republic, the one subject on which its greatest advocate, the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, would never utter a syllable was the flag.

          From my own experience of an organisation called Ausflag, I am aware that probably the longest standing campaigner, or rather the most influential campaigner, in Australia for a change of flag is one Rupert Murdoch. A flag competition was run by Ausflag a few years ago in which a prize was offered and a certain design was chosen. It was all entirely backed by Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch is also our most noteworthy campaigner for a republic in this country. It should be a matter of record that this former Australian, now an American, always has been one of the driving forces in moves for changing the flag.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I conclude with my original point: if there is to be any change in flag design it has to come from the people, just as the original design evolved through several decades of Australian history from the 1850s through to 1901; and it was a popular choice because it had come about through usage. It was truly a flag of the people by the time it was declared to be the Australian flag. It was the flag that Australians of the very new nation of Australia wished to have as the symbol of their nation to the rest of the world.

          Should the flag ever be changed—I personally very strongly doubt that there will ever be national sentiment to that extent—then it must be a flag of the people. It cannot be a flag that is foisted on us by others, no matter how superior they may think their wisdom is, because the flag is so basic to the community. Therefore, I very enthusiastically yet again support the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. It will give the people the right to vote in a referendum on any proposed change to Australia's national flag.

It has many things going for it but the most important one is, as the previous speaker, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has said, that it enshrines the right of the Australian people to choose their own flag and, also, for them to have a say on any decision on the flag. What it really does is to facilitate the parliament being able to put to the people a form for either keeping or wanting to change the

        Another reason that I am very keen to support this bill is that I have been a very staunch supporter of the Australian flag not only since I have been a member of parliament but long before that. I have always had great delight in presenting Australian flags, within my electorate, to organisations that qualify for the Australian flag and also to students who are going overseas on exchange programs. I think the Australian flag is a marvellous symbol for people to take overseas and to present to their hosts as a reminder of their visit and, at the same time, it is a reminder of the fact that they are ambassadors for Australia.

        I can confidently say that I have presented over a thousand flags within the electorate of Wannon since I have been the member. Furthermore, I have presented many petitions to this parliament, and the number of signatures on those petitions would exceed 10,000. I have had a close association with the flag both within my electorate—and I have been very proud to do so—and also within the parliament itself.

        On three separate occasions I have presented a private member's bill on exactly the same matter as this bill: back in 1990, in 1991 and again in 1992. On those three occasions I put a challenge to the previous Labor government to accept a vote on that private member's bill, yet they never would. I think it is to their eternal shame that they were not sufficiently proud of the Australian flag to be able to enshrine this bill in legislation in this parliament.

        We are now very fortunate that we have a government that is prepared to stand up so firmly for the Australian flag and to put this bill to the parliament.

         One of the interesting things when I presented that private member's bill on those three separate occasions is that I was sure there were many members of the then government, the Labor Party, who privately agreed with what was being proposed but, unfortunately, because of their then leaders, they were always being forced to toe the line. I particularly refer to the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who seemed to have a pathological hatred for the Australian flag; in fact, for everything that was symbolic of the achievements of our nation.

         Who could forget his performance when he went to Indonesia in 1992 and the way he disparaged our flag when he was overseas? As a former foreign minister and Governor-General, Mr Hayden, once said, `The one thing you don't do when you go overseas is bag your own country.' Unfortunately, his former colleague obviously did not extend that as far as the Australian flag.

         One was often cynical enough to think that the former Prime Minister used questioning the Australian flag as a diversionary tactic when Australia got into so much trouble with the recession that we `had to have'. He obviously thought that by distracting the attention of people with an argument about the Australian flag he would somehow take the spotlight off his own shortcomings and the shortcomings of his time as Treasurer and, more recently, as Prime Minister. Clearly, it got out of control and I believe that rightly the Australian people have continued to reject the comments and thoughts of the former Prime Minister.

         Now I think there will be widespread support right throughout the community for this bill. Unlike when Labor was in government, the parliament is going to be able to have a vote on this bill and I would be very confident of the outcome. I do find it rather curious, though, that until as recently as 1988 the Labor Party had it on its platform that it would abolish the current flag, then suddenly—I guess because electoral pressures started to get a bit stronger—it slipped off the platform.

It is also an enormous insult to those who served their nation overseas under the Australian flag; who were proud to serve their nation under the Australian flag; and who saw that as the symbol of why they were prepared to go and serve Australia overseas, often in great hardship—and sometimes they paid the supreme price for doing that.

         It is interesting to go back through a little bit of history of flags in Australia. I know there has been some discussion already but I would like to add a little bit more to it. We have to go right back to 1642 when Abel Tasman discovered Van Diemen's Land to find when the first flag was brought to Australia. Of course, it was a Dutch flag and it was taken onto Australian soil through the surf by someone swimming. Then on 29 April 1770, some 130 years later, Captain Cook raised the Union Jack at Botany Bay and on 22 August in that same year he again raised the flag at Cape York and claimed the east coast in the name of King George III. But as Britain did not take formal possession of Australia until 1788 the French had time to make some territorial claims and did this by raising a French flag at Shark Bay in Western Australia in 1773. I think that shows just how symbolic flags were seen to be then and, I believe, are still seen to be today.

         The first flag that was designed and made in Australia was created from a silk wedding dress and it was flown by the bride's husband at Richmond in New South Wales back in 1806. It was inspired by the news of Nelson's victory in 1805. As has already been said, the current flag evolved from a competition held by the first Australian government jointly with a magazine called the

         It is also important to look at a little bit of the flag, just to see how significant each part of the flag is. If we look in the canton, or the first quarter, we see the Union Jack. Some might say, `What is the role of the Union Jack there today?' It is worth reminding the House why it is there and what the Union Jack stands for because it stands for independence and it also stands as a symbol of unity because the Union Jack is made up of three parts: the cross of St George, for the English heritage; the cross of St Andrew, for the Scottish heritage; and the Psalter of St Patrick, for the Irish heritage which goes into the Union Jack.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It goes much further than that because the Union Jack tells us not only a lot about our history but also a lot about much of our origins: our Westminster system of democracy and of democracy itself; our independent judiciary; much of our culture and many of our traditions; and, probably most significantly, our language, the English language. So the Union Jack has a very significant role on the flag even today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also the federation star, which symbolises the coming together of the six colonies to become the six states, with the seventh point added to represent the territories. Then there is the Southern Cross, which we are very proud to have there. We see that very much as showing our geographical position in the world, being the land of the Southern Cross.

         I would like to debunk some of the arguments we hear when people talk about changing the Australian flag. Our flag is not only a great symbol of national unity, it is also an icon that reminds us of the great strengths of the democracy we have inherited, a symbol of so much of our heritage, and it represents the democratic processes of our founding fathers, as described earlier. We talk about our role in the Asian region today, but we are still the land of the Southern Cross; it still symbolises where we are in this region, not just in the whole world.

          When we talk about history and where we fit in it is worth being reminded of the words of a couple of very wise people who have commented in the past on the importance of recognising one's history. The Roman statesman Cicero said:

        The flag is the symbol of our country, but of itself it contains a great deal of symbolism. When you hear critics of the flag you would think that it was entirely dominated by the Union Jack. In fact, the Southern Cross is perhaps the most significant symbol on our flag, taking up over half of its area. Australia is called the `Land under the Southern Cross', so it is a most fitting symbol for us to have on our national banner.

        The Federation Star tells the world a great deal about Australia. We are a federation of states rather than one country divided into provinces, as is the case in so many other national federations.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also have on our flag the Union Jack, which, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) commented, is itself a combination of symbols which reflect something of the past of our country—the fact that we are a part of the British Commonwealth of Nations and the contribution that Britain made to our early settlement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But in these days, when we talk about Australia being a multicultural country, the Union Jack also fills another role. It demonstrates that Australia is a country also made up of people who have come here from other parts of the world. It has often been said that the history of Australia is a chronicle of 200 years of immigration. We have on our flag the flag of another country to demonstrate the contribution that people from other parts of the world have made in building the great Australia that we know and love today.

         So those symbols have been put together on a single pennant—our national flag. We fly that flag with pride because of the way in which it symbolises the achievements and the aspirations of our country. Our flag has been taken with our soldiers into battle, our statesmen into negotiation, our sportsmen into victory. It has been there on occasions of great national pride. It has been there on occasions of great celebrations. It has also been there when our nation has been in sorrow. Is it any wonder, therefore, that Australians have become attached to their flag?

         It should come as a surprise then to observers around the world that it should even be necessary for this parliament to be considering legislation to ensure that the flag's design is not just changed on the whim of a Prime Minister or on the whim of a parliament. One would have thought that after flying proudly in this country for almost a century it would be utterly entrenched, but this legislation has become necessary because it was only this time last year that we had a Prime Minister who had no commitment to the flag, who openly advocated that it should be changed and who travelled around the world talking about the inappropriateness of our flag.

His efforts to demean the contribution of the early pioneers, to reinvent history to support his own theories, were part of a very tragic era for our country.

         It is true that not everything that has happened since Australia was settled by Europeans has been perfect.

It is true that, with the benefit of hindsight, we know some
         <break page="8296" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          things that were done at that time could have been done better, but I have no doubt that there were many Australians who were diligently attempting to assist the Aboriginal people.

A recent public opinion poll by AGB McNair demonstrates that 66 per cent of the Australian people support the design of the existing flag and only 27 per cent oppose it. It is interesting to note that survey was taken in spite of the campaign organised by the former Prime Minister to cast reflections on the suitability of the design.

Even in this parliament earlier today we saw another design, which looked like it belonged more to a used car sale than on top of our national parliamentary building, being paraded as another possible alternative. There have been some pretty, graphic designs. There has been some skilful use of various symbols to develop banners which might appeal to some, but it is impossible to believe that any of those designs could ever capture the support of the Australian people and win a referendum.

         One of the features of this legislation that I think is very important, and that I am delighted to see included, is the requirement that, if there were to be a referendum for a new flag, the existing design must be included in the opinion poll. The existing design must be one of those put to the Australian people for consideration.

         Even if some day in the future our country decides to become a republic, our flag would be none the less relevant.

But the Union Jack would also retain its relevance. It would still reflect on our history.

         This legislation will help ensure that it will stay ours and theirs for future generations unless there is a vote to change it. I commend the government on bringing this legislation before the parliament and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) for the way in which he has piloted it through this chamber. I commend the bill to the House.

I, like others, present it to students, rotary students and exchange students going overseas. I always present the flag, and I am always pleased to present the flag. So make no mistake about that.

         I am a little surprised that this debate is taking place, and I am a little surprised that it is taking place in this chamber, because this side of the House has argued for other debates to take place in this chamber and they have not been permitted. The euthanasia debate, for example, was held in the Main Committee. I do not refer to it, as some people do, as side show alley. In fact, that term offends me greatly. I wish people would not refer to it in those terms because I do not regard it as side show alley.

         I have one small difficulty with the current flag. I particularly like the Southern Cross there, but I do not like the idea of our flag of Australia having the symbol of a foreign country in the corner of it. That might not come as much of a surprise to many people. Take that symbol of another country out of our flag and I am quite happy with the Australian flag. I do not necessarily want that symbol replaced with any other symbol. I am quite happy for the flag—as it flies in this chamber—to have just the Southern Cross on it.

In fact, recently, I was at an international conference—there was a New Zealand delegate and an Australian delegate there—and they had the New Zealand flag in front of me and the Australian flag in front of the New Zealand delegate. I discreetly said to the person there, `If you do not want to create an incident, I suggest you switch these two flags,' which they very quickly did and for which they apologised profusely and told me that they did not know the difference.

         As many people have said, the flag is important to a nation. It does symbolise a nation. It does not symbolise a nation to me when you have such a large part of it taken up with the flag of another country. I strongly reject the suggestion that those of us who do not kowtow to a foreign power are somehow less loyal or less Australian or are somehow more suspect than those who wrap themselves in the flag and come in here. I cannot believe some of the things that have been said during this debate. I always reject questions such as who is more loyal—it seems to me that we get the argument somehow confused—but it seems to me that those who want their own distinct flag are, if you want to use the criterion of loyalty, more loyal than the others.

         Other countries have gone through this debate. The interesting thing about Australia is that we think if we change our flag the world is going to stop and Australia will never be the same. Canada went through this debate. It was a very bitter debate. Canada has much greater divisions within it than this country has. It is a country that has genuine divisions in it and they went through this debate. Those of British descent wanted to keep the flag as it was, symbolising Britain the mother country, and the Canadians came up with a distinctly Canadian flag that is known throughout the world as the flag of Canada. You see the Canadian flag on the rucksacks of backpackers. If you are driving through Europe and you see a group of hitchhikers with a Union Jack, you wonder whether they are Australians, New Zealanders or British.

        The idea of adding the Southern Cross is not new. If you look at the history of the flags, the first known flag devised in Australia was the flag of Honor Bowman of Archerfield, near Richmond. At her property she flew a flag which depicted the symbols of a kangaroo and an emu holding a shield, which has become, through two manifestations, our coat of arms. Later, in 1820, a group of seafarers sent to the Lords of the Admiralty a white flag with the red cross of St George and a star in each of the four quadrants, symbolic of the Southern Cross.

In fact, the Anti&amp;hyphen;Transportation League suggested a flag not unlike the one we have today, and that was as early as 1851, with the Union Jack in one corner and a yellow Southern Cross, without the Star of Federation or the Commonwealth Star, sitting against a blue background.

        People do not take very kindly to their Australian symbols being tampered with. The amount of controversy surrounding the two forms of the Olympic 2000 flag is evidence enough of this. In the short time since the first Olympic flag, which was on our ties, was developed, we now have a second one which is already embroiled in controversy.

But something that always disturbed me was that the old newsreels were reworked using Kevin Golby's voice but with new scripts. Even some of the critics mistook those new scripts for the old scripts and re&amp;hyphen;imposed another sense of history on us. We have to be very careful how we handle these sorts of things.

        Some 72 per cent of the people surveyed in my electorate said that this was the greatest single issue that concerned them. As I go round to schools, I find that there is not only trouble sometimes with literacy and numeracy but also great ignorance of our symbols and the history of our symbols. I have only gone to one school in my electorate that could tell me what the four ensigns represented—the dark blue, the red, the white and the light blue. I think that is sad. When you tell the kids stories about the flags, the coat of arms, the wattle, the opal—all the rich symbols of Australia—and how they were developed their faces light up. We do not inculcate those in our kids as do the British, the Americans and, in more recent times, the Canadians.

        I take a great deal of satisfaction in supporting the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. It psychologically enshrines in the minds of all Australians the need that all Australians should be consulted if there is ever going to be any change to the flag. I think it also lays down a proper mechanism whereby Australians will be given a choice of flag.

         I do not see the Union Jack in the corner of the flag as a symbol of oppression or sycophancy, I see it purely as a symbol of where our parliamentary system of government came from and where our rule of law came from. A lot of people from non&amp;hyphen;British nations who have settled in Australia also see that as a great symbol. They came here for the security, the rule of law, the peace, the lifestyle that it embodies. I remember a TV interview one night with a young man who was fifth generation Irish. He wanted to know why we wanted to change our flag. I find the same problem. I will readily embrace whatever the Australian public decide at a referendum. I commend this bill, which gives the maximum amount of choice to Australian people, to the House.

I think credit also needs to be given in particular to Mr Jock Cameron, the brother of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), who has actually been doing a lot of work in organising the forum. We are hopeful that our national political leaders will be addressing the forum. The forum is about nurturing leadership qualities in young Australians in their late teens and early 20s.

        I have been asked in recent years about success—in particular, by young doctors about success in medicine—and I would like to share with the House some reflections that I have upon it. I think it is important that we all remember that, no matter how old or wise we may think we are, many of the facts that we now learn, the things we believe to be facts, will become superseded and those that are not superseded we will forget.

        In the end, for young people in particular, I think it is worth remembering that your final achievements in life eventually depend on your continuing ability to acquire new knowledge, the inner integrity of your intellect—something which is destroyed, of course, through experimentation with drugs—and the humanity with which you deal with other people. As they say, those who give the most in life are those who receive much more than they give. In the end, people are remembered not for what they know but for who they are.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For young people also, I think it is worth remembering that success is not measured by the number of degrees that you accumulate, the wealth that you may also accumulate as you go through life, nor by the spectrum of people whom you know. If you look throughout the community and society to those for whom we have the highest regard, it is those who have fought for the things in which they believe. Facing adversity and hardship and, at times, criticism in their chosen fields, these are people who persevered in making the lives of the rest of us perhaps that much better.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In choosing a career, which is something that many young people are doing at the moment, I have certainly found that it is helpful to ask yourself the question: `When I get to the end of my working life, is this the sort of career which I feel will have made my life worth while? Is it one in which I  will have been of greatest service to others?' That of course is something which gives people the greatest satisfaction with their lives—no

        In considering the issues of leadership throughout the forum, we will be considering precisely what it is about and trying to nurture these kinds of values in young people in particular and, in doing so, relate them to a sense of values and perhaps a faith in something greater than themselves. Essentially, I believe that leadership is a presence that attracts other people to follow and to participate in a common cause. It is not about charisma, as the St James Ethics Centre reminds us, but it is an infectious wish to bring about positive things for the good of the community and for the country. Leadership is about engendering and evoking in others a genuine enthusiasm for overcoming their own self&amp;hyphen;interest and supporting those things that are in the best long&amp;hyphen;term interests of society.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We will be thinking about things like ethics. We will be encouraging people to be at ease with themselves, to be motivated by a sense of duty and responsibility. We will  encourage clear&amp;hyphen;minded decisiveness in young people and the courage to achieve. I urge honourable members to bring forward names of young people in their electorates who they feel may be interested and suitable for such a forum. We will be looking for energy, wit, commonsense, integrity, self-restraint, humility and openness in the young people who come.

        The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had recommended to the government that the petroleum industry's price surveillance regulations be removed and that the two petroleum specific acts, the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, be repealed. In fact, we need the opposite—that legislation needs to be strengthened.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Most honourable members should have received two pieces of correspondence from the Motor Trades Association of Australia and from the Service Station Association Ltd which bear this out very strongly. They indicate that to date oil companies have not shown that they are willing to negotiate in good faith on matters of importance to service station operators. The situation is so serious that the directors of the Motor Trades Association of Australia decided at their meeting in October to withdraw immediately from Oilcode.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When Oilcode was established back in 1989, those who became parties to it did so on the understanding that it would be underpinned by the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act rather than be a substitute for that act. So Oilcode has relied for its existence upon the acts and therefore cannot substitute for them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also a matter of concern that service station operators are excluded from all of the state and territory tenancy acts because tenure is provided by the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. Repeal of these acts would mean that service station operators have no tenure, no legal rights with respect to renewals, non&amp;hyphen;renewals or any other of the elements of their commercial relationship with those franchisors unless they are provided by contract, which they never have been.

         This is a matter of considerable concern, as have been the proposals for the entry of new parties like Woolworths to the petroleum market in circumstances where the competition would not be fair because they would have a buying advantage as against the franchise service station operators who are tied to their franchisor for 100 per cent of their supplies for petroleum markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So in those circumstances, with Woolworths expected to open an estimated 250 petrol outlets, the industry will be subjected to significant structural adjustment through attrition, quite probably through bankruptcy, and quite possibly many service stations will close with the loss of a great many jobs. So in these circumstances we need some changes.

         We have had strong recommendations from the Service Station Association concerning the need for price access to untie supply in order to keep oligopolies and the major oil companies honest over the long term. We need the supply untied but we also need legislation to protect franchisees. In this regard it is important that the federal parliament's inquiry into fair trading come down with appropriate recommendations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the past oil companies have not made adequate disclosure to franchisees. They have harshly and unilaterally altered franchise agreements without the prior agreement of or even in consultation with the franchisees concerned. In those circumstances, franchisees are often the economic captives of the franchisor and they do not get a fair go. As a result, there is a need for legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to specifically prohibit harsh or oppressive commercial conduct.

         —The Western Australian Labor Party has promised to wind back the industrial relations clock by four years by promising to remove the industrial relations reforms on workplace agreements if it is elected this Saturday, 14 December. This is yet another indication that the Australian Labor Party is an industrial relations dinosaur when it comes to workplace reform. It is a step back into the dark ages of workplace regimentation.

        All informed workers and hence voters in this Saturday's Western Australian election will be aware that the award is, quite rightly, the safety net provision for workers. Without the flexibility of the workplace agreements provisions, workers are locked into a very rigid pay deal which gives them little chance to better their pay and conditions. Dr Gallop's proposals should scare the living daylights out of Western Australian workers when they contemplate his returning them to the dark ages of industrial relations, especially those tens of thousands of Western Australian workers already happily employed on individual contracts.

        Is there really another agenda? Prior to the 1993 Western Australian election, the former ALP labor relations minister, Yvonne Henderson, stated that it was her party's and her intention that all WA workers would be compelled to join a union. Yes, the ALP were going to make union membership in Western Australia compulsory. Yvonne Henderson and the former Lawrence ALP government were keen supporters of the draconian no ticket, no start mentality in the Western Australian work force.

        Is this what Geoff Gallop and the state ALP want to return WA workers to? Under the Court coalition government, Western Australian workers have had a choice. This flexibility in the Western Australian work force has seen WA workers achieving great take-home pay and the ability to earn more.

         business and employers need the ability to make localised and personal decisions about mutually agreed pay and conditions, and the flexibility to negotiate and trade off to achieve these ends. There is no creditable economic commentator in this country who does not agree that the Australian work force in general must become more flexible before greater and sustained growth can occur and that this flexibility in the labour force will see a genuine reduction in unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Few workers and employers in Western Australia would disagree that the coalition's current workplace policy strikes a good balance between productivity and fairness. It allows workers to negotiate agreements on an individual basis. Alternatively, if the worker wants to be employed under the award, they can choose to do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Geoff Gallop, by wanting to impose collective bargaining on workplace agreements, chooses to ignore the fact that 70 per cent of the Western Australian work force does not belong to a union. These people want the individual flexibility to negotiate their own set of conditions which they want to factor to their personal circumstances. For example, a mum wanting to start work after nine and finish at 3.30 p.m. can do so under a flexible agreement—so she can take her kids to and from school—if agreed terms and conditions are negotiated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other 30 per cent making up the unionised work force can choose to negotiate with the union as their agent at this moment in Western Australia, if that is their choice. However, I am not convinced that all of that 30 per cent union membership in Western Australia would choose to select the collective arrangement with the union as their agent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I declare that Dr Gallop should stop pandering to the Western Australian unions. I say to Western Australians: don't vandalise the productivity gains and wages growth that have been achieved under a more flexible workplace agreements program in Western Australia; don't victimise or terrorise those workers whose individual and legal right it is to choose the flexibility and productivity that go with the Court government's Workplace

         —I want to raise two matters this evening. The first concerns a purchase by the 11-year-old son of one of my constituents, who was a member of a school delegation from Caves Beach Public School to the parliament and to the Australian War Memorial on 15 October. During that visit he bought and took back home to his mother what he thought was Australia's symbol, the kangaroo, and what he thought was an Australian flag. It is a very poor representation of the Australian flag. When you look at the label on the kangaroo, it reads:

        I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to have a look at the wisdom of this—with all the rhetoric that is going on about nationalism, particularly in the flag debate today—when a 11-year-old child thought he had bought something wonderful for his mother.

        The other matter is totally different. It is one that I feel very deeply about. I ask all other members of the parliament to join with me this evening in paying tribute to the four miners who had their lives snatched from them in the tragic mine disaster at Gretley Colliery near Wallsend at about 5.30 a.m. on 15 November last. The four men were:  48-year-old Edward Batterham of Teralba, which is in the electorate of Charlton; 36&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old John Hunter and 30&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old Mark Kaiser, both of Belmont; and 19-year-old Damon

        Here in the parliament of Australia, I want to place on record the courage of those four Australians. They worked in a hostile environment—as do all underground miners. They worked in conditions under pressures and dangers which would not be tolerated, even understood, by many members of this House.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They were decent, honourable Australians doing their everyday job of work. How they died and why they were engulfed in the sudden torrent of water that broke through the coalface is yet to be established. I want to convey to each member of the four families involved and to the loved ones of each of the deceased my deepest sympathy at their tragic loss. Miners are so often derided as underworked and overpaid, mostly by people who have no conception whatsoever of mining conditions and the bonds between miners—the bonds that are so utterly essential to their survival underground.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mining is a dangerous occupation. The risk of injury is seven times greater than any other industry, yet there are Rambo mine owners, mine managements and mine associations which claim that the safe working regulations, the safety practices, are too tough, too stringent; that mine safety should be deregulated; and that mine safety practices should be left to the determination of individual mine managements.

        There is scarcely a family in the Hunter that is not in some way linked to mining. My two eldest sons work underground, so I feel it particularly. Since 1847, some 1,532 miners have died in mining accidents in the Newcastle area. The grief of the Hunter and the pain that is shared was    evident at the emotional and crowded memorial service conducted on Wednesday, 27 November at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Hamilton. The service was conducted by the Catholic bishop Michael Malone and the Anglican bishop Roger Herft. It was attended by the Governor of New South Wales, His Excellency Gordon Samuels, the New South Wales Premier, members from both sides of the New South Wales parliament plus many other members of parliament both state and federal. We

       <para first-indent="16">
        The industry is tough and dangerous and the rules  governing its safe working conditions must be correspondingly tough. I have heard various explanations of the cause of the flooding of the coalface where the four men were working. There were old workings nearby dating back to the 1920s. The maps, it appears, may have been wrongly marked. I am told that approximately a 4-feet by 4-feet hole burst through the coalface and they were engulfed with the enormous force that came through, that water, about 100 metres under ground.

         —I rise to speak tonight about some of the wonderful people of Petrie. It is with very great sadness that I speak about the passing of Mr Lindsay Meyers. The St Peter the Fisherman's Anglican church at Clontarf was packed on Monday with hundreds of people for the funeral of Redcliffe businessman and community activist Lindsay Meyers. Mr Meyers died last Thursday aged 71 after fighting a very long battle with motor neurone disease. He is very sadly missed.

        Mr Meyers was born in Maryborough, attended the Gympie High School and joined scouts at a very young age. He had a very long and active involvement in the scouting
        <break page="8309" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        After the war he became a saw doctor and married Molly McMillan. They had a home in Redcliffe for many years. They have two children, Kathryn and Russell. He was very keen on tennis and was a very active member of the Redcliffe Tennis Association, where he was president for five years.

        From 1972 to 1975 the family was situated in Papua New Guinea where Mr Meyers oversaw the establishment of a planing mill for Papua New Guinea softwoods. On many occasions since my time as the member for Petrie, he lobbied me about the importation of these wood products from overseas—quite heavily, I might add—so I was in constant contact with him. He was a man of great energy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He was a member of the Papua New Guinea Apprentice Board. He also set up three scout groups in Papua New Guinea. He returned to Redcliffe where he bought the Dunstan's Planing Mill on Anzac Avenue and he went into joint partnership with an English firm to fingerjoint timber and produce mouldings. They are very well known throughout the Petrie electorate for this work. His son, Russell, now manages the family business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After some time, Mr Meyers sold out and decided to help his son. He then joined the Queensland Timber Board Merchants Division where he was elected to the Queensland Forest Industry Training Council to help young people train in the timber industry, and he was noted for the great work he did in this industry.

        He was a charter member of the Kippa&amp;hyphen;Ring Rotary Club and was awarded one of Rotary's highest honours—the Paul Harris Fellowship. I have had a number of events and functions organised by Mr Meyers and have had a great involvement with Rotary as well. As if that was not enough, he was a member of the Alcohol and Drug Foundation Redcliffe branch and became Queensland branch treasurer.

         I will always remember him as a man of great energy and great dedication. He always had a smile. He was respected by all in the Redcliffe community, and was also willing to help anyone who needed a hand. I pass on my sincerest condolences and sympathy to his wife, Molly, and his children, Russell and Kathryn. He will be sadly missed by all in Redcliffe.

          , handed down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I do so as a member of that committee, but with an apology as well. I became a member of this committee only this year, and have done so in my capacity more as a shadow minister for sport than as somebody with the prerequisite to be concerned principally with environmental matters. As a consequence, I did not participate in too many of the inquiry discussions on this matter. In fact, history will show that it was work largely done in the previous parliament by the former committee—and carried on ably, I might say, under the direction of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in the present parliament—which has seen this document produced.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the outset, I would say that this again gives an indication of how effective parliamentary committees can be in looking at very important issues in the national parliament and making recommendations which we hope the government would like to act upon. It is specifically on the area of World Heritage recommendations that have flowed from this report and the way that government might operate and might take cognisance of those reports that I want to make some comments today. One of the most important World Heritage areas that Australia possesses is, amongst many others, the Great Barrier Reef. Therefore, I am sure it will come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, or to my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay, the chairman of the committee that is with us today, that I take this opportunity to make some comments about the management of the Great Barrier Reef, about the recommendations that are contained in this document, and about what I perceive to be some very misguided policy direction which the government has chosen to adopt as a result of budget constraints and the need to raise revenue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, I refer more generally to what has become known as the reef tax issue in North Queensland. Interestingly, the committee did in fact touch on this issue, at about page 183 of the report, where they talked about the reef tax. At paragraph 8.40 and subsequent paragraphs, the report lists a couple of the concerns which I have about the implementation of that proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To refresh members' memories, I remind you that the proposal for an increase in the reef tax, or the environmental management charge, first surfaced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget. As members would know, a $1 charge had been placed by the former government on the use of marine facilities by visitors to the reef; that is, the major tour operators using boats to take visitors out to the reef charged an extra $1 as an environmental management charge, and the proceeds of that were to go to the management of the reef itself and to aid in ensuring that the environmental purity of the area was not denigrated to any extent.
        </para>
        <break page="8313" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          This government, regrettably, has seen that charge as something of a milch cow: in the budget it was announced that there was to be a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax, to take effect from 1 January 1997. Quite rightly, the local operators in the tourism industry were up in arms about this decision. They were up in arms because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had, during the election campaign, stood in Cairns in the midst of the tourism operators and had told them categorically that not only would there be no increases in taxes and no new taxes introduced by his government but also that in tourism specifically, and in respect of the reef tax, there would be no change. To say that the tourism operators felt betrayed by the Prime Minister and that they questioned his credibility as a result of the 500 per cent increase mooted in the budget is an understatement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As time went on we saw that this issue gained momentum, particularly in five electorates on the North Queensland coast. We saw that the local members, either Liberal or National Party, came under considerable pressure from the tourism operators and their constituents to have this decision overturned. They seemed to make grandiose promises whilst they were in their electorates but, unfortunately, when they came to Canberra they must have remained reasonably silent because they certainly have not delivered.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We saw that constant requests from our side of politics for this issue to be reviewed and debated in the parliament were rebutted on every occasion. Parliamentary tactics were used to shut me down when I tried to bring motions to the parliament or bring matters of public importance to the notice of the parliament. There were four separate occasions when that happened. It was quite obvious that the government was running scared on this matter, which the committee rightly identified in its report as one of major concern. As a consequence, we had extraordinary scenes. For example, an organisation in Far North Queensland actually came out and said that the minister responsible, Robert Hill, should be sacked.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Following an announcement of a review of the operations of GBRMPA—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—which is covered in this World Heritage report, Steven Moon, General Manager of Ocean Spirit Cruises and spokesman of the Cairns&amp;hyphen;based Marine Tourism Industry, said in a press release that that was nice, but it had nothing to do with the reef tax. He went on:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          We are calling on the Prime Minister to intervene in this issue not only to resolve it once and for all but also to maintain his own integrity after promising the industry in Cairns this would not happen.
         </para>
         <para>
          Mr Moon also said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          It is imperative that Senator Hill be asked to surrender his portfolio to a more competent and efficient member of government to maintain any credibility for any future negotiations that may be required with industry. The feeling at this time is the government cannot be trusted.
         </para>
         <para>
          This was from the industry which had gotten behind the coalition in these five seats in the last election on the back of a promise that the reef tax would not be increased, and suddenly felt betrayed. And that press release had followed another, under the heading of `Promises, promises, broken promises!' which had been issued in September by tourism operators.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The simple fact was that, behind the scenes, the pressure was starting to tell because John Moore, the minister for tourism—who is, after all, a Queenslander—and also Minister Robert Hill did have some meetings with the operators in Queensland. That was the first sign of any consultation he had with them. Interestingly enough, at five seconds to midnight, literally—on the day before President Clinton's visit—a press release was slotted out by Robert Hill saying, `We have had a change of heart and we are going to have a two&amp;hyphen;for&amp;hyphen;one tax.' It is not just
          <break page="8314" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           going to be an increase by 500 per cent in one hit; we are going to have a two&amp;hyphen;for&amp;hyphen;one tax. `We will increase the reef tax, the EMC, from $1 to $2 to start on 1 January 1997 and then'—interestingly enough—`there will be a new $4 tourist visitor charge levied on users of commercial facilities and craft from 1 January 1998.'
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          My maths tells me that is still going to be $6. My maths tells me that, in 1998, it will still amount to a 500 per cent increase. But, interestingly, it raises some other problems for the minister. A $4 tourist visitor charge is only going to apply to Queensland and it is only going to apply to users of the Great Barrier Reef. So it is anti&amp;hyphen;Queensland and anti&amp;hyphen;tourism, and it is supported by a minister who comes from Queensland—the minister for tourism, John Moore. After Minister Hill put out his press release, Mr Moore put out a press release saying this was a great idea. His press release said:

          We found out that that little proposal was actually floated by Senator O'Chee and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) at a secret soiree—which was not so secret—in Cairns on 11 November. I just happened to be up there at the time and I knew that it was on. It was on at 8.30 in the morning and these two guys—a couple of boys on a man's errand—went along to try and convince the tourism operators they should accept this so&amp;hyphen;called compromise.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Cairns Post
          </emphasis>
          the next day said it all: `Compromise over reef tax rejected.' The tourism operators said, `This just won't work. You are still going to give us a $6 increase management fee reef tax.' The thing that is even more worrying for the tourism industry—and which is rightly pointed to in that section of the report which we are debating here this morning—goes to the question of the new $4 tourist visitor charge. I do not care how you dress it up, that is an increased tax; it is a new tax. And that goes counter to everything that this government has said about no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But there is something even more sinister in this—and people have not cottoned on to this yet. The reef tax, as it is now, is levied on people who get on one of the Quicksilver or Ocean Spirit cruises and go out to have a look at the Great Barrier Reef. I did it myself. I took my family out there in April of this year. You get on the boat and go out to the Reef. You get snorkel equipment and you paddle around and have a great look at the Reef. It is a fabulous experience. It is one of the main reasons why we are attracting so many tourists to Australia, particularly from markets in the Asian region.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But now we find that the press release that Senator Hill has put out and which Minister Moore thinks is fabulous—this is a Queenslander supporting an anti&amp;hyphen;Queensland tax—says that this new $4 tourist visitor charge is going to be levied on users of `commercial facilities and craft'. What does that mean? Does it mean it is not now going to just apply to the vessels that go out, but also to commercial facilities in our tourism mecca of North Queensland? To me it means that it can also be levied on restaurants and hotels. This is a de facto bed tax dressed up as some sort of an environmental management charge. The words are not mine; the words are directly from this media release from Senator Robert Hill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is a joke. In this report on the managing of Australia's World Heritage, on that same page which I referred to earlier, it goes on to say that this charge should not be just levied upon the people that it was formerly levied upon; the tax should not just simply be on them. It talks about any users of the Reef. It talks about the recreational boat users—people that are in single craft up there.
         </para>
         <break page="8315" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           That is quite interesting, because on 23 May 1995, John Moore, who was then the Shadow Minister for Industry, Commerce and Public Administration in the opposition—but, again, still a Queensland member of this parliament—and who now is the Minister for Tourism, purporting to represent Queensland tourism, wrote to the Independent Boat Owners Association and said:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding the introduction of an environment management charge or reef tax. I appreciate you writing to me on this matter.
          </para>
          <para>
           I bet he did. He stated further:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           I would like to assure you that the Liberal Party is opposed to the introduction of an environment management charge.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
           Once again, thank you for raising your concerns with me.
          </para>
          <para>
           I know we all write letters and say things occasionally that come back to haunt us. This letter will come back to haunt John Moore. Quite clearly, the report, in its recommendation that the reef tax should apply not only to people using the Ocean Spirit or Quicksilver boats, on page 184, paragraph 8.43 says:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           The Committee considers that a joint State/Commonwealth review of fees applied to users of the reef region should be carried out, with a view to recommendations being made on how a single fee could be applied to all users of the reef that incorporates in an equitable manner charges for those purposes for which each user accesses the reef.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So the recommendation coming from the committee—chaired by someone, I might say, who has done an excellent job in this report—suggests that all users of the reef now be levied the increases in the reef tax.

           I again go to this fact about commercial facilities and craft. My beef is not with the committee and the committee chairman, because I think the committee, in the process of looking at the issues, came to decisions based on the information contained in reports that were given to them. My concern is that the minister has not responded, for example, to the editorial in the
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Sunday Mail
           </emphasis>
           of Sunday, 24 November, talking about the reef tax being introduced and being anti&amp;hyphen;Queensland, anti&amp;hyphen;tourism and anti&amp;hyphen;jobs. That editorial has to be rammed home to both these ministers.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Let me conclude by simply saying again that I think the report itself in general is very good. Regrettably, I do not think enough time was spent on the reef tax issue. It is only a couple of pages and about three paragraphs, and not all its ramifications were considered. I note that none of the members who represent the North Queensland seats made any representations to the committee for consideration, but that is their prerogative and fits into the pattern that they have been adopting here. This tax will be opposed by the opposition when it comes before both chambers for deliberation.

          —by leave—I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the report. Let me at the outset thank the members of the committee for their contribution to this particular report. I think it is a report of considerable substance. The honourable member who has just spoken, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), acknowledged that the reef tax took only one or two pages. That is because there were many other issues of at least equal significance—I would argue greater significance—on which the committee spent a great deal of its time in preparing the report.

         I pay tribute to the former chairman of the committee, John Langmore, who resigned from this parliament on Friday. Unfortunately, not many of us were given an opportunity to speak following his valedictory comments. On behalf of the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee, I would like to recognise his considerable contribution to the committee as its chairman. I had the honour to be his deputy for quite a period of his term as chairman, and I always found him to be extremely fair, a very caring person, a very pleasant person, who went to great lengths to ensure that the committee was able to consider issues in a balanced and responsible way. John Langmore came into the parliament, from memory, in 1984. He was a member of the committee from 16 October 1991 and became chairman from 4 June 1992, until the change of government precluded his continuation in that position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         John took a keen interest in social, environmental and particularly economic issues. He was the author of a number of books and was very highly regarded by all members in the House. It could be argued that he was not a man of his time. He was advocating interventionist policies at a time when the trend was towards deregulation, he had a particular interest in social policy when economic issues seemed to be the priority, and he believed in equality at a time when there was a growing variation between rich and poor. But I think John contributed greatly to the intellectual and philosophical debates of the parliament. I congratulate him on the very high post that he has achieved at the United Nations. I know he will fulfil his responsibilities there capably and he will be a wonderful ambassador for Australia and contribute once more to his country in that post.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I acknowledge with gratitude the contribution of John Langmore and the previous committee in developing this report. In that regard I would like to also mention a couple of other members of the committee who were not here to see it presented: Neville Newell, Bob Chynoweth and Bob Horne from the Labor Party, who took a keen interest in this inquiry and participated in many of the inspections; and particularly also Bruce Lloyd. He was one of those who were really at the forefront in instigating this inquiry and who were also very diligent in participating in its public hearings. He was, because of his retirement from parliament, not here to see it presented. I did arrange for him to get a copy of the report and he spoke enthusiastically about its recommendations and was delighted to see that it had come to the parliament.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The facts are that Australia is a wonderful country with tremendous resources and wonderful scenic attractions. Perhaps that is no better illustrated than by our involvement with the World Heritage Convention. The World Heritage Convention came into force in 1975. Australia was one of the first signatories and now there are 146 countries that are a party to the convention, which makes it one of the most significant international conventions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were 469 properties on the World Heritage list as of December 1995. Of those, 102 are natural sites and it is an interesting statistic that 11 of those 102 sites are in Australia. So of the 102 most notable places in the world, an incredible 11 are in Australia. That says a great

         One of the key elements that was apparent in the evidence the committee received and, indeed, was an underlying theme throughout all of the deliberations of the committee, was that Australia, particularly in the early stages of the World Heritage Convention, was extremely enthusiastic about nominating areas. However, our enthusiasm for nomination was not extended to a commitment to the management and funding and adequate caring for the areas that we had nominated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regrettably, around the country, very negative attitudes started to develop towards World Heritage listing. There was almost a fear in the community whenever it was suggested that an area should be nominated for the list. In my own region, which probably has had more potential World Heritage nominations than any other electorate in the country, the issues became so significant that I prepared a guide on World Heritage listing to explain what it actually meant. I did so to try to explain to the people in my constituency that World Heritage listing did not mean giving the land away to the Libyans or having people from Paris come in and say what we could do and run the day-to-day affairs of the community. On the other hand, I needed to explain that some of the extravagant claims that were being made by supporters of World Heritage listing, namely, that it meant automatic tourism and the showering of money from Commonwealth and state governments, were also inaccurate.

         It has always been the case that the only way to attract tourists to an area is to provide appropriate facilities and happy tourism experiences. The word then spreads from one to another that this is a great place to visit. In fact, there is quite a deal of evidence to show that at some sites World Heritage listing has actually led to a drop in the number of tourists. It is an issue that has been oversold in some areas as a benefit for World Heritage listing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the other hand, some of the fears that have been instilled in communities are, frankly, irresponsible and have not been borne out by the facts. I have not noticed any extra Libyans wandering around Fraser Island since it has been nominated, and that is clearly the case everywhere. However, I think that the Commonwealth and the states, but particularly the Commonwealth, failed for the first decade or more of World Heritage listing to adequately explain what it meant and to take the local communities into their confidence when an area was proposed for nomination.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee has therefore recommended that in the future, before an area is nominated, there needs to be thorough and active community consultation. We need to win the support of the community and a part of that process needs to be to develop the management plan in advance. It was always intended under the World Heritage Convention that the management plan be submitted as a part of the nomination, but that did not really happen in Australia's case. In fact, we had the farcical case, the international embarrassment, of the Willandra Lakes which was all that is bad about the World Heritage listing process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Willandra Lakes case was a rushed nomination that was clearly made for political purposes. We got the boundaries wrong and the most important parts were left out of the area nominated for World Heritage listing. There was no commitment to funding. Some state bureaucrats incorrectly advised us that landowners could no longer use the land. This has festered for more than a decade but, finally, the boundaries have been corrected. Around one&amp;hyphen;third of the area is no longer listed because it was not considered to have the sorts of values that required it to be listed. Also, there has at last been some commitment to compensation.
         <break page="8318" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          A management plan has been developed. In fact, we even acknowledge in the report that what has happened over recent years could perhaps be a model for what could happen in other places.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But it has been over a decade too late. Sadly, reports of the experience of the Willandra Lakes have spread around the country and, naturally, have caused concern in other areas. In the future, when we have an area that we want to nominate, let us first talk about it with the community. We can then develop a management plan and also get the commitment to funding—this is a key element—the ongoing management and development of the area before the nomination is made.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Sadly, we have stored up all of these World Heritage areas but there has been a lack of commitment to fund them to make sure that the maintenance occurs and that the necessary visitor facilities are installed. It has to be said that the Commonwealth managed World Heritage areas such as Kakadu and Uluru have been less disadvantaged in relation to funding than other areas. I think the committee, during its deliberations, visited most of the World Heritage areas. Indeed, the committee has visited all of the World Heritage areas over recent years. The financial assistance that the Commonwealth has provided at Kakadu and Uluru is obvious to any visitor. There are excellent visitor facilities and the standard of management has reached a high level. Sadly, that is not the case in some of the World Heritage areas managed by the states. Queensland has more World Heritage areas than other states but its record is probably the poorest.

         Fraser Island in my own electorate was nominated in an atmosphere of great controversy. The Commonwealth and state provided a $51 million compensation package which essentially arose from the parallel decision to stop logging on Fraser Island. But that $51 million package, negotiated between the Goss government and the federal government of the day, has largely disappeared into the sands. There is very little to show for it. Instead of securing the future of the region, as was intended when the package was announced, the money has dissipated into many worthless projects and into activities that have no lasting benefits. There is little to show for the expenditure of that money.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Certainly, some of the projects funded were worthwhile, but they had little to do with securing the future of the region. Money was spent on constructing streets in Maryborough City, including one in front of my own office. Money was transferred into that project though work was completed before Fraser Island was even World Heritage listed. Money was spent on museums, church foundations, a home for the aged and buying rowing shells. They are all very worthwhile things but they had very little to do with the intention of the package.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Money was spent on routine maintenance such as garbage collections. A big package of money was allocated towards a forest thinning project, and for maintenance work on Fraser Island and other places. That sort of work would normally be done as a part of the routine responsibilities of the state parks service and other government offices. What developed was a systematic siphoning of Commonwealth funds into the state coffers by guise of the package funding public servants to do work that they would have done anyhow. There was little lasting benefit to the region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         More importantly, in relation to Fraser Island, no effective community consultation process was put in place before or after the nomination. The local community was overwhelmingly opposed but no effort was ever made to win them over about the merits of World Heritage listing. An interim management committee was established which involved local government
         <break page="8319" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          leaders and others in the community. That committee has not met for around three years. The community consultation process has broken down. All of these things need to be addressed.

         There are similar difficulties with some of the other World Heritage areas where there has been a failure to adequately consult with the people of the region. We came across similar difficulties on Lord Howe Island. So it is not just in the state of Queensland that there are problems. It is obvious that, in many instances, the states have made inadequate efforts to involve the communities actively in ensuring that the World Heritage areas are presented effectively to the interested world community, and also to ensure that the World Heritage area is a good citizen, that it participates in the local community and that its management is commensurate with the wishes of the local community to achieve the objectives of their region.

         This report contains some 54 recommendations—a plan for the future. It will require a commitment of more money and resources. I call on the federal government to make an early commitment to provide the financial resources to ensure that these recommendations can be implemented. We need to look after the precious areas that we have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On occasions there will be a desire to nominate new areas for the list. I hope that the processes in the future will be better than we have had in the past.

         I listened this morning to the contribution of the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the ALP spokesman on tourism. He devoted the whole of his speech to the environmental management charge on the Great Barrier Reef. In talking on a report such as this dealing with World Heritage areas, I would have thought that a tourism spokesman for the ALP would have mentioned the park at Uluru, Kakadu, the Tasmanian wilderness, the Wet Tropics in
         <break page="8320" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Queensland, Fraser Island, Shark Bay, the Naracoorte fossil sites, the Riversleigh fossil sites, or the Willandra Lakes.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the member for Cunningham did not mention them. He focused instead on the environmental management charge of th Great Barrier Reef. It is very interesting to read what the committee actually said about that charge. On page 183 of the report the committee said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount. It supports the move in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 Budget to increase the environmental management fee by $5 . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         Who signed off on that report? The ALP members of that committee were the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the former member for Fraser, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who is the shadow environment minister, and last of all the member for Cunningham—the man who this morning spent 15 minutes talking about the environmental management charge. The member for Cunningham, the honourable S.P. Martin MP, signed off on this report.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would have thought that a shadow spokesman for tourism who signed off on a report like this would have at least read the report first. I know there was a minister in a previous government, Ros Kelly, who used to sign off on things such as environment packages before reading them. But I would have thought that before he signed off on this report the member for Cunningham would have read it. I remember someone on our own side—I think it was the member for Fadden, in 1991 or 1992—who signed a report that contradicted his own party's policy at that stage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But for the member for Cunningham to come in here this morning and devote the whole of his speech to the environmental management charge shows a disrespect for the important parliamentary work done in committees—I acknowledge that he did do some work in committees in the late 1980s and early 1990s relating to banking—and it shows a disregard for the other 10 World Heritage areas in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         His concern with the environmental management charge shows a neglect of the very people who elected him. He came here as a representative of the people of Wollongong. What he is saying to them is that it is all right that they pay a lot of taxes through their own income; it is all right that they pay an incredible amount in wholesale sales tax; but it is unacceptable for the government to increase a charge on visitors to the Great Barrier Reef from $1 to $6.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When he talks about a 500 per cent increase, admittedly that sounds horrific. But when you consider that it is an increase from $1 to $6—that is an increase roughly equivalent to the price of a hamburger—and the average price of a package to the Great Barrier Reef is something like $130, it puts the matter in perspective. If people actually make a decision to visit the Great Barrier Reef an increase of $5 is unlikely to make any difference to their decision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In its submission to this committee, the Department of Finance actually regarded the $1 charge as being on the low side and more of a token charge. And there was feeling, even from the acting executive officer of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, that the market would probably bear something much higher than the $1 that is in place at the moment. Five dollars a day was mentioned as the possible charge, but increasing the charge was seen as presenting considerable difficulties.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In looking at some of the other World Heritage areas—and Australia does have 11 of them; the member for Cunningham mentioned only one of them—during the course of the inquiry, the committee, of which I was a member, travelled to Kakadu and we found that Kakadu is, by and large, well funded and well managed. The key question while we were there revolved
         <break page="8321" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          around whether Kakadu and also the park at Uluru should be managed by the Commonwealth or handed back to the Northern Territory.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory argued that having the Commonwealth run Uluru and Kakadu—it is run by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency—was expensive, was an administrative duplication and was inconsistent with the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. There have been some votes in the last week which they might also see as being inconsistent with the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. The Tourism Council of Australia in its submission said that it would support handing the management of the World Heritage areas at Uluru and Kakadu in the Northern Territory back to the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The feeling of the committee was that a transfer could only be effected with the agreement of the traditional owners. The evidence that we gained was that, while on one hand the Gagadju, the board at Kakadu and the Anangu of Uluru opposed the transfer, on the other hand the Jawoyn Association, which has land both in Nitmiluk National Park and in Kakadu, said in a letter to the Prime Minister that they would like to be dealing with one body, presumably the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory. They had no objections to a transfer of the Jawoyn area of Kakadu back to the Parks and Wildlife Commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What was evident from our trip was that relations between ANCA and the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission had deteriorated. Our concern was that, without any cooperation, that deterioration would be evident in areas such as weed and feral animal control. Therefore, in two of our recommendations we felt that, before transfer back to the Northern Territory could be considered, the relationship between ANCA and the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory needed to be re&amp;hyphen;established.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We suggested a number of ways in which that could be done. It had been the practice in the past that through a mutual agreement the officers of the Northern Territory Conservation Commission, now the Parks and Wildlife Commission, had worked in Kakadu and Uluru. We suggested that they re&amp;hyphen;introduce that practice and have some of the Northern Territory officers working in the park. We also suggested that the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission should be involved as observers at board meetings, in order to re&amp;hyphen;establish the relationship between ANCA and the Northern Territory.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are, as I said, 11 Australian sites listed as World Heritage areas, owing to their universal natural and/or cultural significance. As a signatory to UNESCO's convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage, the Commonwealth is responsible for the conservation, preservation and presentation to the public of these sites. Most sites are managed by the states, with Commonwealth oversight, the exceptions being Uluru and Kakadu, which I have just mentioned. As we would all be aware, the Commonwealth can use the external affairs power to intervene if the states fail to protect the values of those World Heritage areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such intervention has characterised some of the environmental battles of the past 20 years, revolving around the differing responsibilities and roles that the Commonwealth and states have had. The examples of the banning of sandmining on Fraser Island—which, I might add, occurred before Fraser Island was listed as a World Heritage site—and the prevention of the building of the dam in the Tasmanian wilderness, a prevention which relied on the Tasmanian wilderness being a World Heritage area, highlight Commonwealth government intervention in the area of the environment.

          In terms of funding, the committee felt that Kakadu and Uluru&amp;hyphen;Kata Tjuta were well funded by the Commonwealth, but that in areas managed by the states, with some top&amp;hyphen;up funding from the Commonwealth, there should be two principles which established the level of funding. The first was that the state government should fund the areas to the level that they were funded at prior to being listed as World Heritage areas, and that the Commonwealth should provide top&amp;hyphen;up funding to raise the standard and also to preserve and present the values that allowed the areas to be listed as World Heritage areas. The second was that agreement—which, as the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has highlighted, has not always been there—should be reached between the state governments and the Commonwealth on the amount of funding that each should contribute.

          In my own state of South Australia we have only one World Heritage site and that is the fossil site at the Naracoorte Caves Conservation Park.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Unfortunately, as the member for Wide Bay has already mentioned, Fraser Island and the Riversleigh fossil site were identified as two World Heritage areas which lacked adequate funding and had problems in terms of information sites, the way the values were presented to the public and the way in which they were highlighted as World Heritage sites.

          All World Heritage areas should consider the need for cost recovery measures to supplement government funding. It is important to establish the principles which should dictate how user fees should operate. And that was dealt with in recommendation 53. In that, we asked the department to review user fees in the World Heritage areas, and to establish how user fees should be administered and set.

We have the current investigation of that. Obviously, there were concerns about the rights of those people who indulge in fishing as a hobby. They were the thrust of the concerns.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The agreements are argued for on the basis of our negotiating leverage with the Japanese; the access fee that we receive; the protection of the southern bluefin tuna stocks; species monitoring; the funding of research; and, as was indicated by the earlier comment, the meeting of international treaty requirements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must say that I am not as convinced as others about the `high access fee'. It is very questionable that we actually know the value of this produce on the Japanese market. I have seen estimates of $94 million. We tend to be too inclined to look at a comparison of ourselves with countries that are not really in a very strong negotiating position. We only have to look at the events in Vanuatu over the last month or so to see some of the infrastructure that is lacking in those countries affecting their ability to deal with major powers. The Solomon Islands is another instance. I appreciate that South Africa was one comparison made to the committee and maybe they could say we are in a reasonable position in what we have accomplished compared to South Africa. But with the dislocation there in the last few years I do not know how strong their bureaucracy is in its ability to deal with these kinds of issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do think the committee has to keep under review whether we are getting a reasonable deal out of this. At the same time, we do have to be careful in dealing with the Japanese that we do not force them out of the system and thereby endanger the species by their non&amp;hyphen;involvement. The committee dealt with the threat of non&amp;hyphen;involvement of Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and others. That is a matter that the government has to keep under serious review.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The one thing that did concern me—and this is probably a personal view and did not concern other members of the committee—was that the Australian tuna boat owners have a very close connection with the Japanese market. Although I can understand their personal requirements and commercial interests, I did have a fear that their very positive attitude towards the Japanese involvement was perhaps affected to some degree by that interrelationship. We have to be very careful when people have these commercial tie&amp;hyphen;ups that, whilst they might perceive themselves as arguing from the basis of Australia's national requirements, perhaps their position is constrained by those realities. In the long term I see a need for us to be vigilant when they argue that we have gained the technology or the knowledge. As I say, they are very closely entwined with the Japanese market and that is a factor in how we review this industry.

          Returning to the thrust of the inquiry, we have advocated more training for the observers to increase their knowledge of seabird research, the collection of data on seabird by&amp;hyphen;catch and the effectiveness of by&amp;hyphen;catch mitigation measures. While the committee could not arrive at an unquestioned determination, there have been claims that although there seemed to be a reasonable presence of observers there have been instances where there was a correlation between the observers' presence and the reports of by&amp;hyphen;catch or other concerns in the field. The thrust of the inquiry was around the question of seabird by&amp;hyphen;catch and I want to commend the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) on this issue. If any member of the committee really did focus on this issue throughout, it was him and the committee's report owes something to his determination to put that issue forward, particularly on the question of the albatross.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We must be concerned that since the 1952 arrival of the Japanese in the long&amp;hyphen;line industry there seems to be an increasing danger to the albatross and related species. It was interesting to read the information about the albatross that came to the attention of the committee. Its survival is very much a hairline exercise, not just because of by&amp;hyphen;catch but throughout history. Albatrosses take 11 years to start breeding and they only produce one egg every second year. Those are all factors, as well as the fact that the female does tend to forage in areas where long&amp;hyphen;line fishing is prevalent. They are also not all one species and those from different islands, such as the Antipodes, Auckland, Tristan da Cunha, are very much endangered.

          It is worth noting the comments of
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Nature Australia
          </emphasis>
          in the winter of 1995. Their claim is that 50,000 had been killed in Australian and New Zealand waters, and I think this puts the issue where it is at:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          As an expanding world population demands more from the ocean's resources, the task of protecting vulnerable species will not become easier. Our inadequate knowledge of albatross populations, their greater dependence on resources in international waters and their insignificant economic value result in complex political issues and no funds for research. Raising the funds to apply this technology is an urgent task as a diminishing population increases the difficulty of acquisition of knowledge essential for their survival.
         </para>
         <para>
          So, when we take into consideration the fact that they do take 11 years to breed, every second year, that they basically need a 32 to 33 per cent survival rate to sustain themselves and the average one has to reach 30 years before it essentially replaces itself, there are concerns. I am pleased to say that the committee's emphasis is on measures that put this in the forefront.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, with the by&amp;hyphen;catch of other fish species there is a very strong emphasis by this committee not that we seek to minimise the numbers but that we actually are proactive in trying to eliminate it as much as possible. Of course, the report goes into various alternatives: night setting, where there are indications of a 70 to 96 per cent reduction; the question of bait throwing gear, which is already, as I understand it, used on over 100 Japanese boats; the investigation in New Zealand and Norway of setting lines under water by a hydraulic ram to send the bait down; and forward baits. All of these things should be followed through very strongly, and I think it is fair to say that the committee is very supportive of activities in those fields.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, the committee has given approval to the treaty. It emphasises throughout the need for greater information. It does express concern because of the circumvention of Australian ownership of vessels; it does extend the boundaries on the Tasmanian coast. But overall it does express a concern that we must put the conservation measures to the fore.

          —First of all, I thank the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) both for his comments this morning and for his contribution to the
          <break page="8325" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           committee. Both have been substantial. I will come back at the end of my contribution this morning to say a little bit more conceptually about this committee and what it is about in this parliament. But let me start off by saying that this particular report, which is the third report of four that have been tabled since the committee was set up as a result of our government's initiative in May, is a little different from the other three. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, as a member of the committee, three of the four that have been tabled have dealt with specific treaties that have been tabled under the so&amp;hyphen;called 15&amp;hyphen;day rule. This is slightly different in that it is an issue that was thought by the committee to be appropriate to test the waters, in many ways, to see what a specific bilateral agreement was all about and to see the level to which the community and government organisations wanted to become involved. As a result of all that, quite apart from the magnitude and the size of the report and the issues that it covers, I think it reinforces the wisdom of what we are doing as a parliament in terms of the treaty making processes and the reforms thereto.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is an important report in that it deals specifically with a bilateral agreement between Japan and Australia in terms of southern bluefin tuna. The committee also took the opportunity, about two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the way through the couple of months of inquiry, to pick up the suggestions from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. These issues are embodied in the report.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is an important report at ministerial level for a number of ministers, and not simply because of its size—the report was prepared in very short order—and the issues that it raises. At the global level, it is important for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), in terms of the treaty&amp;hyphen;making process, and for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), in terms of resource implications. It is also important for Senator Parer, in his responsibility as resources minister, and specifically the fishing industry. It is an important report for the state governments that were very heavily involved in our inquiries on this matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also important to some of the peak bodies and the non&amp;hyphen;government organisations, notably, the Tuna Boat Owners Association of Australia. We hope it will be a valuable tool to enhance and improve what is already a very healthy situation in that industry. Hopefully, as a result of this report, and if ministers and government agree, some of the initiatives reflected in the recommendations will be helpful in enhancing the diplomatic and commercial relationships with our important partner—that is, Japan.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) indicated, the report gets into wider issues than the treaties committee intended with this particular one. I think the report will be an important tool for the house committee which, as I understand it, is dealing with the more global issue of fishing resources and the fishing industry. I know that the secretariat of that committee is looking at it and we hope it will assist them in resolving some of the issues and, inevitably, some of the problems within that particular industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, this report is different from the other three that have been tabled in the House, the last, of course, on Monday of last week. The report deals specifically with the subsidiary agreement between Japan and Australia on long&amp;hyphen;line tuna fishing. It also makes some valuable comments and recommendations in relation to the agreement on the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. I am delighted that Senator Parer has announced—I think in the last week—that Australia is to become party to that commission. This highlights the fact that government can react to some of the recommendations that this committee has made in very short order and we welcome that.

        <break page="8326" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will read into the record a number of the benefits of the subsidiary agreement between Japan and Australia because I think they are very important. I will then very briefly highlight one or two of the recommendations. The report makes the point that the benefits of the agreement to Australia include: a high access fee by international standards—the honourable member for Reid questioned whether it is high in relative terms but, in general terms, the feeling is that the access fee is high—no damage to Australian fisheries as Japan uses its own quota of southern bluefin tuna and highly migratory species such as yellowfin or bigeye, ensuring that southern bluefin tuna stocks are not further reduced; monitoring of species stocks that would otherwise not be possible, or would be difficult and expensive; and access to the Japanese fleet to influence their seabird avoidance practices.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The report talks about economic benefits. Those economic benefits, of course, are very substantial whether you look at the direct benefits or the multiplier effect. There is some argument as to what the multiplier effect is. It varies between about two and five but if you look at the direct economic impact in a port like Fremantle, for example, and apply a multiplier, it does have arguably an economic plus of about $70 million to $80 million to the Australian economy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It provides the Australian government with some leverage in other negotiations within the commission on southern bluefin tuna. It provides us with access to Japanese data on fishing locations which is very important. It provides access to Japanese data on shared stocks outside the Australian fishing zone. It enables the collection of biological samples. It, in fact, provides direct funding for research on tuna and billfish. It should be pointed out that the Japanese contribution to that is substantial and without this bilateral agreement that would not happen. Of course, as the honourable member for Reid highlighted, it is part of meeting Australia's commitments under the umbrella United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea obligations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We also make mention in the report of the disadvantages to Australia of not concluding the agreement. We hope that there is no consideration given to not concluding the agreement but we have reinforced our view by making the points that the disadvantages would be substantial and could include the potential environmental and financial losses. I forgot to mention that among the ministers who are involved here, an important minister who has more than a casual interest in what this report says is the Minister for the Environment. There is a very large element in this report in terms of by&amp;hyphen;catch and mitigation measures et cetera that we hope the government will pick up and implement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We point out the financial loss as a result of the loss of the access fee; the fisheries relationship with Japan in diplomatic and commercial terms; and the regular forum of communication with Japan albeit that that is always difficult. Japanese are hard negotiators as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) would know and I hope he will say something about this in due course. I will say a bit more about the benefits from port access arrangements in a moment. As far as accurate and timely information on technological developments are concerned, the Japanese have been very influential with Australian tuna fishermen in transferring some of that technology. I suggest that this would not have happened without this particular bilateral agreement.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Australia's influence over Japanese fishing operations in relation to by&amp;hyphen;catch has already been mentioned. Funds for management and research would need to be sourced from

           —You will have your chance, Mr Price. There are three specific recommendations I would just like to highlight. One is in terms of the periodicity of the bilateral agreement. It has been one year. We are recommending at least two years for a number of reasons that I do not have time to go into. We think it is very desirable that the duration of that bilateral report is extended and I understand that Senator Parer, for example, is reasonably disposed towards that but it has to go through the bureaucratic processes.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The second recommendation I would highlight is the one in relation to Tasmania and the 50 nautical mile recommendation for southern bluefin tuna. At the moment Tasmania is restricted to a 15 nautical mile limit. We, on balance, felt the limit should be consistent right across the country, and we recommend that Tasmania extend its exclusion zone to 50 nautical miles. We commend that recommendation to ministers and to the government.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The other recommendation I would like to highlight concerns port access and the separation of port access and quota. It took up a lot of our time in inquiries and in consideration in committee. We have come down very strongly on this view, which I would like to read into the record:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends the separation of port access from the subsidiary agreement but—

          with this caveat—

          That is an important caveat, which we hope will enable the negotiations to continue and to enhance what are already reasonable arrangements.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I conclude by reiterating what the honourable member for Reid said about countries outside the bluefin tuna commission. There are some other important nations that fish on the high seas—namely, Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea—and the People's Republic of China is becoming an increasing player in this area as well. We hope that this agreement can, in due course, bring those countries in under the umbrella of the commission.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, my final point is in relation to the reforms that were announced earlier this year and embodied in the formation of this committee. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said in the House in question time yesterday, what this government is about is consultation with, and accountability to, the Australian people. That is what the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is all about. I regret to say, to be party political for a moment, that is what the other side did not do in government.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not often that I get the opportunity to have the drop on the chairman of a committee—in this case, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who has just completed his contribution. I want to take up the last point that he made. In the last parliament I well recall the current Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) talking about their proposal for a treaties committee. I believe that, in this place, the best defence is always truth and honesty. I have to say that not only did I have some reservations about the proposal but, at best, I was indifferent to it and probably a little sceptical about it. I certainly felt that having a committee that dealt with nothing but treaties was perhaps not the best approach and that utilising the existing committee structure was probably a better approach.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that members on both sides—to be fair—in the last parliament were unhappy about the inadequate addressing of treaties. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has, in my view, proven itself, notwithstanding the shameless dorothy dixer asked by the honourable member for Groom yesterday. It has worked, and the fact that it encompasses a wide range of different subjects does not in any way seem to be impeding its good work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For anything that adds to this parliament, I am always grateful, and I think that the treaties committee is doing that. I note, for example, in the report that we are talking about, that 45 submissions does not break the record, but it is 45 more than we would have received in the old parliament. The great virtue of the committee system is that, when a committee is run well, it opens the parliament up to the people. Just when we are facing the new millennium or the 100th year of federation, members of both houses need to be conscious that we are extending opportunities for ordinary citizens, in particular, to access the parliament, to be in touch with parliament and understand what it is doing. I congratulate the honourable member for Groom. I congratulate all of the committee members—I think they are doing a very good job. I am not a member of this particular committee.

         Turning to the subject matter of the report, I also acknowledge the role of John Langmore, who was the chairman of the environment committee. As you know, he has retired. John has many virtues which were not always recognised in this place. One has been a commitment to the environment, particularly in his role as chairman of the environment committee. I have noticed, since I have been a member, that more and more people in the cities are becoming more and more concerned about environmental issues.

         Fisheries is a particularly sensitive issue. As citizens of this world—I know that is a term some people do not like using, but we are all citizens of Australia and also citizens of this world—we have witnessed the extinction of some fishing stocks, where they have been absolutely fished out. In America, there have been the sardines and in Europe, the cod. There is quite a list of them.

         We cannot treat fisheries or what is in our ocean as an inexhaustible supply. We have to be conscious that we owe it to future generations to preserve what we already have so that we do not lose any more species, and to ensure that species are not over&amp;hyphen;fished. This becomes very difficult when some countries, in terms of diet, are heavily reliant on fish and think that they have almost a unilateral right to fish to meet that demand.

          That is, I guess, my general position. I also wanted to say, in terms of Australia and the environment, that I notice that school children these days are far better environmentalists than my generation ever was. There are probably a number of explanations for that: the impact of TV, of communications. In particular—and again, this is probably not fashionable—I would compliment the teachers in schools for the sense of awareness they are creating in a generation of younger Australians about the environment. I commend them.

           —Very thorough, and I note he was going to finish his speaking time on a number of occasions. I am particularly interested in the issue of by&amp;hyphen;catch in the report and I want to commend the committee. I note that there are a number of recommendations dealing with the principal by&amp;hyphen;catch which is birds—albatross and some other species. I will not run through the list. I think by&amp;hyphen;catch, in all aspects of fishing, is a particularly important and serious problem. We do need to develop either techniques of fishing or management that eliminate by&amp;hyphen;catch problems.

          In this case, of course, I am talking about the bird life, but in other cases it can refer to other species of fish that are just thrown out. And whilst we have undertaken a deal of research into those catches that have an economic value and are much sought after, unfortunately there is not a lot of research done on those species that form part of the by&amp;hyphen;catch problem.

         —I am pleased again to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate today, this time in the Main Committee, on the question of civil aviation safety in Australia. The discussion today relates to the report that was done by Commissioner Staunton into relations between the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and Seaview Air.

        As I said in the House previously on this matter, this report makes very disturbing reading. When you actually go through the detail in the report you can see that not only is there a very strong pattern of deliberate flouting of civil aviation regulations by the operator on a very wide range of issues, there is also an equally strong pattern of the regulator, in effect, conniving in this flouting of regulations—ignoring it and allowing the operator to continue flouting the regulations. Ultimately, this was in gross dereliction of its duty as a regulator.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Responsibility for this has been sheeted home to a couple of key officials within CASA who, thankfully, as a result of the findings of Commissioner Staunton's report, have since paid the consequences. Nonetheless, it does give a very disturbing picture of the situation within the
        <break page="8330" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         then Civil Aviation Authority and it fits very well with a similar picture that was presented by Mr Peter Gould, the Coroner, in his inquiry into the Monarch crash, which was only a month distant from the Seaview crash. Both occurred in a very dark period for aviation safety in Australia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some of the issues that are dealt with in the Seaview report include: the operation of a regular passenger transport service without authorisation—Seaview was only supposed to be a charter operator but it was de facto operating as an RPT service; regular overloading of the planes; regular siting of unrestrained cargo inside planes; a variety of defects in maintenance with respect to instrumentation and equipment; and, for a period of time, flying without an appropriate maintenance release.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we see in the Seaview report is a picture of an operator, Mr Green, who clearly had an absolute disregard for the basic safety and security of his customers; who was concerned to make money and was quite happy to cut corners in order to pursue profit; who was quite happy to put extreme pressure on his pilots in order to ensure that they complied with his wishes rather than their obligations to the passengers, their professional obligations as pilots, and their obligations to the public in accordance with the civil aviation safety regulations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Green does not emerge very well from this report and I share the concern of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to ensure that Mr Green no longer conducts any form of passenger transport service in the aviation industry, given the attitude that he has demonstrated and given his subsequent behaviour and apparent lack of contrition as a result of the findings of the report.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of equal concern emerging from the report was the finding that the relevant Civil Aviation Authority officer at the time, Mr Paul, had virtually deliberately failed to carry out his duties to properly surveil the Seaview operation. On numerous occasions he was presented with clear evidence of breaches of regulations and other serious breaches—not trivial breaches, not technical breaches, but serious breaches—and on each occasion he seemed to bend over backwards almost deliberately to avoid taking any action. He took the word of the operator and failed to follow through on investigations. Clearly, he was biased in favour of the operator and was doing everything he could to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority did not impede Seaview's capacity to operate in spite of the very clear evidence that serious deficiencies in the Seaview operation were apparent and that any reasonable regulator would have addressed those deficiencies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of similar concern is the behaviour of his superior, Mr Bryant, who failed to properly manage and to supervise his subordinate and clearly was complicit in the failure of regulatory enforcement that was involved. The failures of both of these officers are highlighted by the fact that there was, indeed, a conscientious officer, a whistleblower, within the CAA, Mr Hoy, who, as a result of his efforts to try to get some action with respect to Seaview, found that the one substantive response was that his ability to do his job was restricted, that certain limitations were imposed on him within the authority which previously were not there, and that his efforts to conscientiously do his job and to conscientiously look after the interests of passengers in aviation transport were met with not only obstruction but also outright penalties and restrictions on his work.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other thing that is worth observing as a result of this report is that like the report that was done by the Coroner Peter Gould into the Monarch inquiry, there is a clear conclusion that the origins of these problems lie ultimately in the regime within the Civil Aviation
        <break page="8331" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Authority in the early 1990s which imposed a perspective known as `affordable safety'. This led to a very drastic reduction in the number of regulatory staff within the authority—under the so&amp;hyphen;called review of resources—and which led to a situation where the industry was deemed to be the customer of the authority.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Justice Fisher, the Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority said pertinently that it is long overdue that we parliamentarians, the minister, and people in the authority, realise that the authority is not there to serve the industry; it is there to serve the Australian people. It is there to regulate the industry. It is the policeman of the industry. It is there to serve the Australian public and, in particular, the 30 million passengers that are carried in aviation transport every year. That is whom the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is there to serve, not the industry itself. And that ideology which permeated the organisation in the early 1990s has had disastrous consequences and these can be seen in the Seaview and the Monarch reports.

        I have been fortunate earlier this morning to be part of a briefing for the House committee that was conducted by the CEO of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, and a couple of senior officials. That briefing was designed to inform us in some detail as to the steps that CASA is taking bit by bit to bring itself up to scratch, to eradicate the problems that have clearly contributed to the disasters—one of which we are dealing with today. There is an increase in staff, not only administrative staff, which is necessary because of the separation from Air Services, but also regulatory staff both on the flying operations and airworthiness sides.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also provision for better training of regulators, and more standardised procedures to ensure that any particular operator is going to get approximately the same treatment, the same line and the same approach with respect to the enforcement of regulations, no matter what part of the country the operator is in. We have heard of the regulatory review that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development has introduced, and that I applaud. Although the content of the regulations is not the key problem—the key problem has been the enforcement of those regulations—clearly it is appropriate that the regulations be reviewed and brought into line with international numbering and with international standards with respect to precision, lack of ambiguity and the like. So that review is an equally important part of the overall strategy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        CASA is also planning to increase its activities with respect to oversight of international operations in our region, and to ensure that any plane coming in to Australia is subject to an equivalent regime of surveillance in the country of origin. We have planes flying to Australia from a variety of countries and often from very small and poor countries. In some cases, there are questions about the extent to which those planes are surveilled within those countries. CASA is going to step up its operations on that front, a move which I applaud. Another thing that is very clear and that I also applaud is that CASA is fully aware that its obligations are to serve the people of Australia and not to serve the industry, and that CASA is there to regulate the industry.

        The minister has had, in the eight or nine months he has been in the ministry, a rather peculiar track record on the issue of aviation safety. We have seen him overrule his own safety regulators with respect to electronic locater transmitters and impose on the Australian people an alternative standard—and we are the only serious civil aviation safety regulator in the world to permit this—which Mr Keith, the head of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, has acknowledged is a lesser standard of safety. And the minister has directly intervened to bring this about.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have also seen the minister deliberately try to blacken the name of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in order to pursue his very peculiar vendetta against the board of the authority. Mr Keith again made it plain that the board and the minister both support the strategy that CASA management is pursuing to improve performance and to eradicate the problems of the past. In spite of this, the minister is pursuing an extremely peculiar vendetta against both the chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Mr Justice Fisher, and other board members.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result, we have seen the situation where, in the case of the recent Falcon Airlines crash, the minister—in seeking to blacken CASA by pointing out that the former owner of Falcon Airlines was now a CASA officer in the same region and by suggesting that there was a conflict of interest issue involved—deliberately failed to point out that, as a condition of his new employment, the person involved, a Mr Killen, was obliged to engage in no regulatory activities and no supervisory activities in respect of his former airline.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even though there clearly is a question to be considered with respect to the appropriateness of the appointment—let us face it, the source of potentially half of CASA regulatory employees is going to be the aviation industry, because that is where the expertise to regulate civil aviation is going to come from; and so there are always going to be problems of this sort—it is also abundantly clear that there can be no connection between Mr Killen's appointment and any question mark that may exist with respect to CASA's supervision of Falcon Airlines, because he was specifically excluded from being involved in that supervision. But did the minister mention this at any point? No, he did not.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the same vein, Dr Robert Liddell resigned from the authority as Chief Medical Officer some weeks ago, in a burst of publicity and with a range of accusations. It emerged, following that resignation, that the real reasons he was resigning were that the authority was now refusing to pay the cost of his being trained to fly 767s and that his international travel budget had been reduced—neither of which, I would have thought, were particularly deleterious decisions with respect to the core issues of aviation safety. Minister Sharp has failed to come out and acknowledge that, in this instance, CASA was not in any way in the wrong, and that Dr Liddell had made his decision to resign but that his accusations against CASA were quite clearly ill founded. Has the minister actually acknowledged this in public? Not once. He is engaged in a vendetta against CASA and particularly against the board, for reasons which are very difficult to explain.

It is abundantly clear that they are both actively involved and supportive of the position that is being adopted by the CASA management. As far as I am concerned, if he does not have confidence in the CASA board then he equally does not have confidence in the CASA director, Mr Keith, in whom, as I have said in the parliament previously, I certainly have confidence.

         The minister has got to start facing up to some facts. Not only is he failing to contribute to the process of renewal and improvement of our aviation safety regulation process which has deteriorated in the early 1990s, as this report indicates, but also, in effect, he is positively undermining it by constantly attacking the organisation which is charged with that responsibility by undermining the morale of the staff who work in that organisation, by the
         <break page="8333" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

It is high time that he grasped his responsibilities, which are to the 30 million passengers out there who fly, not to small sectional interests in the industry with whom he is very closely associated. They are the people whom we must serve with respect to aviation safety in this country. They are the people whom we have to look after and ensure that they are protected. That is CASA's task. It is not to serve the industry; it is to regulate the industry. It is high time that the minister got behind the authority and the changes that are being made, instead of attacking and undermining it. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

        The commission of inquiry into the relations between the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and Seaview Air is one of the most disturbing and slamming reports we could have the unhappy obligation to read and take note of. Commissioner Staunton's report is a damning indictment of the CAA and all of its operating processes. In July 1994, the CAA conferred the status of an airline—a regular public transport operator—on Seaview Air. Just 10 weeks later, its flagship, VH&amp;hyphen;SVQ, crashed while flying from Williamtown to Lord Howe Island.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This report reveals how an unsafe organisation, Seaview Air, could have the status of regular public transport operator conferred on it and could continue to operate, despite knowledge of lack of safety both within its own organisation and within the so-called regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, and despite repeated warnings. This report reveals the incompetence of a regulator too shy and toothless to implement the most rudimentary safety standards. This report reveals the slipshod and uncaring attitude of a greedy operator which threw caution to the wind without considering the consequences of putting lives at very real risk.

        The nine people who died when that Seaview plane crashed in 1994 would not have known that they were risking their lives by getting on that plane. They would not have known, as did others in the industry and in the CAA, that the airline was essentially unsafe. So widespread was the knowledge of the lack of safety of this airline that when he was a shadow minister, the now Minister for Transport, John Sharp, made warnings in the House about this specific airline.

        The report's 39 recommendations are well considered and insightful. They are the result of the contribution of 142 witnesses, over 900 exhibits, 224 days of sitting, and almost 17,000 pages of transcript. They are, given the most essential standards of air safety, absolute commonsense. In this two&amp;hyphen;volume report, Commissioner Staunton has noted a number of serious issues which require further attention and almost immediate action. Included amongst these are: firstly, an attitude that characterises breaches of the Civil Aviation Act, regulations and the orders—the attitude is called `aviation trivia'; secondly, a practice of cross hiring that enables an operator to use an aircraft of a type not endorsed on the AOC; thirdly, what can at times be considered widespread disregard by general aviation maintenance organisations for the manufacturers' requirements; fourthly, a practice of pilots overstating flying hours to obtain employment with larger operators; fifthly, the standards and adequacy of pilot training; sixthly, allowing new or relatively inexperienced pilots to fly alone and with passengers with very close to the minimum required flying hours for that particular aircraft type; seventhly, and again, the inadequacy of the maintenance release system; and, eighthly, the importance of the regulatory authority to have adequate information about operators and pilots.

For all of us on the committee, safety is paramount to our consideration of the operations of the airport and the delicate balance of ensuring, as a responsible government, that Australia's most significant airport operates effectively, while minimising the inconvenience and environmental implications for Sydney's large number of residents.

        As the chairman of the Sydney airport community forum, with its geographically—and I would like to point out—politically diverse membership, and our close relationship with Sydney's residents on this issue, I baulk at the thought that the slipshod and careless attitude which led to the Seaview crash off Lord Howe Island in 1994 could in any way occur in or out of Sydney airport.

        Out of all the concerns that have been expressed by Commissioner Staunton in this report, the underlying question has to be: was the Civil Aviation Authority competent in its activities and considerations in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the very tragic Seaview aircraft crash? It is absolutely crucial that the now safety regulator, CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which was hived off out of part of the body of the Civil Aviation Authority, has as its key consideration the safety of fee paying passengers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When the Civil Aviation Safety Authority provided a briefing to the Sydney Airport community forum on their day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day operations, they were unequivocal about their commitment primarily, and almost only, to the safety of fee paying passengers in commercial aircraft. That is absolutely totally appropriate. One of the concerns of the Sydney Airport
        <break page="8335" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         community forum was—and I think it was a fair concern—that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not take into account the safety of some of the passengers that live their daily lives underneath the most busy flight paths in the Sydney basin.

        The joint responsibility for safety is not just with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It extends to Airservices Australia and the Federal Airports Corporation and the guiding hand has to come from the Department of Transport. But the dangers are lived by the people of Sydney every day. In fact, the commuters of Australia are living daily with the possible threat of a major aviation disaster. It gives no comfort at all to the people of Sydney that the Civil Aviation Authority, as it once was, has been found, by Commissioner Staunton, to have some of the most irregular and unsophisticated work practices of any safety authority in Australia. Imagine if the 20.5 million passengers who flew in and out of Sydney Airport last year were subject to the same risk as those nine unfortunate people flying on board Seaview to Lord Howe Island were. Imagine if the 269,000 aircraft movements to and from Sydney Airport last year had the odds stacked up against them in the same way that the Seaview plane had the odds stacked up against it.

        Thankfully, there are some redeeming factors. The commercial airlines that operate out of Sydney airport have higher standards than Seaview Air. This report reveals all too fully the fact that Seaview Air was a shoddy organisation. It was run for the most base principles of making money, getting the planes up in the air and getting the passengers out. There was total disregard for some of the most basic elements of civil aviation safety. For example, there was a failure to comply with the basic requirements of regular passenger transport. There were extensive defects on the planes and maintenance was regarded as poor. Also, one of the most obvious requirements of air safety—flying with the proper maintenance release—was often not complied with. Often the planes were overloaded as they were flying off to Lord Howe Island—sometimes up to 130 kilograms overloaded. That is one of the concerns, I might add, of the Sydney Airport community forum—that the courier planes and the transport planes that are departing and arriving into Sydney Airport during the curfew hours may not be complying with the load requirements for the airport and for the individual planes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also strong evidence of excessive work hours for pilots. Sometimes the pilots would understate the number of hours in their trip. In fact, in the report, there is one incident where the Civil Aviation Authority safety officer was in the cockpit with the pilot of the plane flying to Lord Howe Island.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If I remember my figures correctly, the flight was a six&amp;hyphen;hour flight. But the pilot recorded 4&amp;half; hours and he had the Civil Aviation Authority safety officer in the cockpit next to him during the flight. So, where it suited them, there was an excessive recording of work hours for pilots to get their flying hours up and, on the other hand, they understated the flying hours. It does indicate there is a deeper problem in the aviation industry with some of the smaller operators and with what pilots will do to keep their jobs, which are very hard to find in commercial enterprises.

        A lot of people leave school, go and spend a lot of money, raise a lot of money to learn how to fly, and then they are desperate to get their flying hours up and the only way they can do that is with a commercial operator. It was shown that when Seaview Air was operating at an earlier date, the owner of the airline was particularly harsh on the younger pilots, making sure that they worked longer hours and did not receive the proper awards.

         The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has given me some level of comfort out of his briefing with CASA this morning. He said that there will be an increase in the number of staff, particularly in relation to regulation.

         There is an obligation to ensure that the regulator is not institutionally timid, as was the criticism of the CAA with regard to Seaview. The regulator is there to protect the passengers. The nine people who died off Lord Howe Island deserved better than what they received. Air passengers, in trusting their lives to airline operators in every plane flying in and out of Australian skies, deserve better than that.
