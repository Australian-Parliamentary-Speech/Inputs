It says, `Before Labor came to power there were 300 fewer break-ins a day. Serious crime is rising'. He says:

The Australian Institute of Criminology report says that, for the Fraser years, 1975-76 to 1982-83, and the ALP years, 1982-83 to the present, the incidence of homicide in the Fraser years was up 11 per cent and in the ALP years it was up 10 per cent; serious assault was up 131 per cent under Fraser and 140 per cent in our years; sexual assault and rape was up 102 per cent under Fraser and up 89 per cent under Labor; robbery was up 131 per cent in the Fraser years and up 66 per cent in the Labor years; break and enter was up 107 per cent in the Fraser years and up 37 per cent in the Labor years; and motor vehicle theft was up 87 per cent in the Fraser years and up 53 per cent in the Labor years. It goes on. The statistics move about but, basically, they show that trend. The claim is a lie.

         I think the question we have to ask is this: is the Leader of the Opposition preparing us for the kind of society which he knows his policy will bring—survival of the fittest? I refer to a society where one is thrown off UB after nine months, where there is no medical cover without private insurance, where there is no award protection as all conditions of employment are thrown away, and where young people get a place in a tertiary institution if their parents can afford it.

         Is he giving us a foretaste of the future—of the kind of society we should prepare ourselves for—under a Liberal government, with the same sorts of right wing policies which produced the environment that produced these pamphlets in the United States?

        This is the raising of the standard of debate that the Leader of the Opposition promised us when he assumed the leadership of the Opposition some time ago. In fact, what we are likely to see from this is, of course, simply a lowering of the debate. To actually brief journalists to say that there will be scare campaigns and violence campaigns is the low-heeled stuff in which the Liberal Party always traffics in the end. It can never stay with decent policies for decent change to move the thing along. In the end, you will go for Chinese getting us in sampans; Reds under beds; people breaking through your front doors; and crimes and elderly people.

         The Institute of Criminology makes it clear that the prevalence of violent crime is not committed against elderly people; it is against young adult males.

         I read last week the quotation from the Tasmanian Premier when he made clear that employees have a right to associate with and be represented by a union. That is what he said in a very clear statement—that employees have a right of association and to be represented by a union in making that point. There is a basis of agreement in the dispute. The company is now saying that that period has passed, but what it is now doing is obdurately refusing to agree to accept arbitration by Mr Justice Munro, insisting on reserving the right to appeal his decision, but at the same time it is insisting that the employees return to work under another part of Justice Munro's order, as it appeals the first section. So on the one hand it is appealing one section of the order, insisting on reserving the right to appeal his decision, refusing to accept his arbitration, then on the other it is insisting that that part of Justice Munro's decision ordering the employees back to work ought to be agreed.

        It is just a simple matter of common decency in honouring an agreement. But the fact of the matter is that you do not want to do it. This is the kind of industrial relations policy you want. Yet the gall in the question is that, because it has gone to arbitration, when Justice Munro has sat and considered the matters, it is really a blight on the kind of industrial relations policy operated by the Government, where the very essence of the Government's approach, one of conciliation—in line with that of the Tasmanian Government and the employees—would be to settle the dispute and get the people of this city back to work. This business, as we all know, is the largest employer in Burnie. This has very great ramifications for the people of Burnie. People should note and take note of the recalcitrant attitude of North Broken Hill and Mr Wade, and again draw the line under his bona fides and ask the question yet again about his intention ever to have built the pulp mill in Tasmania—the one for which we have all battled so much for resource security—

         In short, the alternative is that the Opposition would deliver control over health costs to doctors by allowing a 30 per cent increase in doctors' incomes to be underwritten by insurance. Dr Hewson says that market forces will keep a lid on costs.

         —Why would any doctor charge his patient less than the insurance rebate that he knows his patient will get? Under Labor, when people need a general practitioner, most often they will be bulkbilled at no cost. When they are billed, they will be billed $23.50 for a standard consultation. Under the deal announced to the AMA by Dr Hewson, it will be $31 every time—the AMA schedule. Under the Opposition, nothing would stop the AMA putting the $31 up as high as it likes because insurance rates would go up to cover the difference. The fact of the matter is that Dr Hewson has done what can only be described as a deal in terms of the particular narrow interests of a single profession.

         The Leader of the Opposition went on to suggest impropriety by the Government in not publishing Medicare figures beyond 1989. If he had cared to research public documents a little further—for example, this annual report—he would have found that we have in fact published more recent figures. But what those figures show is that for the last three years the number of consultations per capita has been 8.5. For three years there has been absolutely no movement.

         —The implications of such a change would be disastrous. Health costs, on the most conservative of assumptions, would rise by at least $2 billion. Health costs overall would increase by 22.6 per cent. Families on an income of $30,000 a year would be paying an additional $22 each week in insurance. These figures are not taking into account the fact that such policies would create an enormous incentive for the AMA, the doctors' union, to increase schedule fees.

Doctors would be able to charge up the AMA schedule fee and market forces would stop doctors from charging like wounded bulls.

        Mr Speaker, you heard that duplicitous question from the honourable member for Bennelong earlier about unions in the case of the TWU and APPM at Burnie in Tasmania. You have heard from those opposite about their attitude of letting Federal awards disband, forcing people out of the system of award determination and award conditions only to let them opt back in with the agreement of an employer. In other words, if it is a non-professional union, it is in for it, with rates of pay and conditions of work to be abolished so that an employer may deal with a sole employee and not a collection of employees banded together  under  the  banner  of  a union.

         But it is okay to deal with a doctors' union, the AMA! You can go along to them on a Saturday, stand up there with the rest of them and propose that you would abolish bulkbilling and let the doctors charge what they choose. When asked by a journalist later, `But how do you stop doctors charging like wounded bulls?', Dr Hewson said, `There is a market'. Does anyone believe that, with a market with private insurance sitting behind it, there is going to be anything but charging what the traffic will bear, as in the United States and, in doing so, lifting the national cost of health insurance in Australia? Dr Hewson had this to say also:

Preliminary trend data also revealed that the April current account deficit, seasonally adjusted, is now the second lowest since February of 1988, only March of this year having been lower.

         On Friday some quarterly statistics were issued for the March quarter balance of payments. The quarter saw the lowest current account deficit since the March quarter of 1988, the fifth successive quarterly surplus on goods and services and the smallest net income deficit for three years and the lowest net services deficit since September of 1988.

         The Leader of the Opposition interjected about what he imagined was going to be some exaggerated embrace of these monthly figures and I said that I would refer to the comments that he made on Friday because we have seen a pattern which has been very clear over the last couple of years, where the Opposition ignores any positive data and simply latches on to anything which is remotely negative and tries to extrapolate that to paint a picture of some portending disaster in Australia. Even given these improved figures, the Leader of the Opposition last Friday latched on to the question that there was a fall in exports reported in the quarterly data which he referred to as a worrying weakness and said that the overall result should cause alarm bells to begin ringing.

         Of course, the Leader of the Opposition failed to appreciate that the treatment now of the ABS meant that some of the exports in the March quarter have actually been pushed back into the December quarter, giving a higher figure for December and therefore a somewhat lower figure for the March quarter. But, of course, these kinds of little analytical and factual details would never stand in the way of the Leader of the Opposition's attempts to try to talk down the Australian economy. He has been doing it consistently over the last few years. Indeed, if we go back to October of last year, we find that he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If this economy picks up off this base, without addressing any of those structural problems, we will have a balance of payments problem, or crisis down the track. We will have a massive deterioration, further deterioration in our balance of payments, we will have a rekindling of inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has happened since October of last year? We have seen the balance of payments continuing to improve and we have seen an inflation figure that is the lowest for something like 30 years.

         But we do not leave it there; there are any number of instances where the Leader of the Opposition will grab at anything. Even as late as January of this year he said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We could easily have an exchange rate crisis and balance of payments crisis in a very short space of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is all designed to conjure up this idea that the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition have that Australia's fortunes are hopeless. Let me just sum up what he said in August last year. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This country is hopelessly uncompetitive.

       <para>
        That is, this country, his country, our country, is hopelessly uncompetitive. Yet it is this country—our country—which is now recording strong growth in terms of manufactured exports. One simply does not do that if one is hopelessly uncompetitive. During this decade we have seen strong growth in manufactured exports and manufactured exports have become an increasingly larger proportion of our total exports. But this is just dismissed by the Leader of the Opposition as evidence of some portending crisis or evidence of Australia's `hopelessly uncompetitive' position.

         There is one very interesting interchange which occurred between Mr Liebmann and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. At least Mr Liebmann was able to see in some of this data some improvements in Australia's prospects. In asking this question of Mr Reith, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, he said:

         I remind the House of just one, amongst many, comments of endorsement from the Australian Tourism Industry Association, to the effect that the total strategy `opened a door to a new era for tourism in this country'. In terms of the contemporary circumstances for the industry, it is worth informing the House that during the March 1992 quarter arrivals were 17 per cent higher than in the March quarter 1991—itself, I remind the House, an all time record year.

It is further to the answer which she gave a few minutes ago to the honourable member for Pearce when she indicated that the discredited environment kit had been sent out before her office received the complaint letter from the National Association of Forest Industries. I ask: does the Minister now recall seeing and reading a message sent out by facsimile in her name, from her office, to all members and senators even earlier than that, that is, the week before she claims to have seen and absorbed the contents of the now discredited schools environment kit—I say again, before the NAFI letter—in which she praised the kit and its contribution to positive solutions? Does the Minister recall that this facsimile, on her letterhead, carried the handwritten signature, `Ros'? Will the Minister confirm that this message was sent with her knowledge and authority? In view of her statements to Parliament last week, is she saying that she also gave her personal endorsement on that occasion—that is even earlier—without knowing what was in the kit? If so, why did she mislead members of parliament on this occasion by recommending a product she now disowns?

         Australia is in the process of downgrading its own diplomatic representation in Belgrade. Australia's ambassador in Belgrade, who left last week, will not be replaced. The Government is moving quickly to implement the UN sanctions regime. Decisions on the detail of implementation will go before the Executive Council tomorrow. The Yugoslav national airline, JAT, which flies out of Australia twice a week, will have its services suspended from this week.

         The UN has imposed mandatory sanctions in view of the failure of Serbia and its allies to abide by earlier Security Council resolutions demanding that they cease their interference in the internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN action is intended to make Belgrade and its allies modify their behaviour. Naturally, we hope that it will open the way to a resolution of the territorial and communal differences. But I would stress here that it is the authorities in Belgrade and their political and military allies who must bear the overwhelming responsibility for the continuing violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There has also been renewed and serious fighting in Dubrovnik.

         Australia has been appalled by the scale of the bloodshed and especially outraged at the unprovoked attacks on innocent citizens. The Government is aware of the anguish and uncertainty felt by all those in Australia who have relatives and friends in the areas affected by the fighting. We sympathise with them at a time when they may feel that they are powerless to affect the tragic chain of events. We commend the restraint shown by these communities and urge them to maintain patience. I assure those communities that Australia will continue to support wholeheartedly international action to bring an end to the suffering.

I might suggest to the Prime Minister before he leaves the building that the parents of the children at 12,000 Australian schools who were to receive an information kit which the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) now describes as unduly negative, backward looking instead of forward looking, unbalanced and containing errors of fact, might regard that as a matter of substance and a matter of concern to them.

         The fact of the matter is that we moved this motion because the Minister has shown a total lack of ministerial competence. We believe that she has betrayed her obligations and responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown and she has totally failed to carry out her task and she should resign. More importantly, what the Minister did amounted to a betrayal of Australia's children. It amounted to a betrayal of the farmers who have worked with the Government, the Opposition and the environmentalists to try to meet the environmental challenges that this country faces. It amounted also to a betrayal of the environment which this Government says it is so concerned about. It is in fact a perfect demonstration that this Government is much more concerned with the theatre of the environment than the substance of the environment, because absolutely no attention was given to the substance on this issue until 12,000 of these kits had been sent off to the school children of Australia.

The central fact is not the one which this Minister sought to proclaim as being the central fact in Question Time today. What we heard twice from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories was that the central point was whether she had seen the contents of the kit before she signed the endorsement.

         I put that question because it encapsulates why this Minister is wrong in saying that the issue is whether she had read the contents before she signed the endorsement. The fact is that she totally failed to live up to the meanest standards of responsibility and totally failed to live up to the standards of responsibility that she and her Government require of every person in Australia who carries on business in a way which impacts upon environmental management. She would bring down penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars on corporations—$20,000 on individuals—if they behaved as this Minister has behaved. But instead of her accepting responsibility, what do we get?

         If one wants an encapsulation of why this is an issue of general importance and why it is not simply focused on this $50,000 to $100,000 error that the Minister has made, one should look at the Minister's statement when she was interviewed on this matter last week and when she talked about the whole doctrine of ministerial responsibility. A journalist asked the Minister:

        But you're the Minister, aren't you responsible for your Department?

        This question was asked because the Minister has conscientiously, with great personal courage, with a concern for the principles of the Westminster system and a concern for the Public Service, said that it is someone else's fault; it is a public servant's fault. There is her concern; there is the loyalty of a Minister to the people who serve her. She was asked by a journalist:

        She pleads again the defence that she had not seen the document before she signed it. So she was asked the question again. The poor old journalist, who wondered at this answer that she is responsible, but she is not, said:

         This Minister has said, `I will accept no responsibility' and, I remind the chamber, `I will sign an endorsement which will go to 12,000 schools with all of our children in them'. This was an endorsement that this kit was an excellent environmental resource, when the Minister had no idea. She had no means of knowledge and she is totally careless about whether this kit is fit for a child—mine or anybody else's. It is a gross act of irresponsibility. It is no wonder that people have contempt for the processes of government.

         This glowing endorsement is not of the label. There is not something written here by the Minister which says, `Look, forget that there is anything in it. This is a lovely package'. That is not what the words say. It is not that this is a nice piece of cardboard; here is a label that one could put around a pot plant and feel better about the environment conference. The statement is that this is full of material which will be useful for a school; it is an environmental resource. The Minister is, in some way, trying to shuffle off and ignore responsibility. Every member on both sides of the House received a letter from the Minister. It was not a formal, stiff circular from a Minister that one barely knows,  but a letter signed `Ros'.

        I ask honourable members to mark the following very important words, because this is why I say this Minister is betraying the children of Australia, betraying the farmers, betraying those who care for the environment and, indeed, betraying the environment itself.

        That is a very important point because I thought the Minister agreed with the view—which has been put forward by many people whom I respect—that, if we are to meet the challenges that exist in the environmental area, we must not be proponents of environmental despair; we must be proponents of environmental hope. We must be saying to the schoolchildren of Australia—who are so concerned about these environmental issues—`Here are the things which you can do to make it work, to make it better'.

         There are some people who I think are worth quoting on this. Associate Professor Peter Newman from the Murdoch University is an authority who I think would be very well known to this Minister. He has been used to prepare reports on many environmental issues, and he has written most sensibly on this issue. He writes about the problem of environmental despair. I would add that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) thinks this is unimportant.

         We have a lot of children in our community who are losing hope, and to sell despair to the children of Australia is a pathetic nonsense. It is wrong, it is destructive and we wonder why our children are nihilist and uncaring and hopeless, instead of being optimistic, forward thinking, bright and high achieving. Too many of our children are turned off by this despair. What Professor Peter Newman wrote was that we should respond by giving people environmental hope. Let me quote Professor Newman. He said:

        This is this Minister's responsibility. Sure, she eventually withdrew it because my friend the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), the National Farmers Federation and others kicked up a stink about it. But the fact is that in an area under her supervision and control we had a message, not of environmental hope but of environmental despair. Peter Newman pointed out:

I invite honourable members to read the first page, which refers to the fact that during this desperate generation of environmental degradation—not the Council's words, but the way this is so often presented—life expectancy in the developing world has increased by nearly 20 years. We have a duty to the children of Australia to give them accurate information which is hope-laden, which is optimistic and which gives them a basis for solid action in the future. The serious matter here is that ministerial carelessness permitted, at great public expense, negative, destructive and hopeless information to be sent to the schools of Australia.

         As I have said, this was also a betrayal of the farmers of Australia. It is often forgotten in debates in this place—and it is always forgotten in the media—that there are many areas of common ground, not least in the environment debate. We, the Opposition, led the charge with respect to the concerns in this country about climate change. We led the charge with respect to the preservation of the Antarctic. We have had a strong and ongoing commitment—and a large financial commitment—to land care. We have totally supported the fact that farmers have been brought together with the environmentalists, local government and all the other agencies, including the State departments, and we have a constructive and wonderful social and environmental change developing under the aegis of Landcare.

         The other reason the Opposition, unlike the Prime Minister, regards this as a matter of substance is that this is not the first time this Department and this Minister have been involved in sending out inaccurate information. In 1990 there was material issued by the Department on greenhouse which, on the Minister's admission again, required correction and change. This Minister has been put on notice. I have here a letter she wrote to Mr Daly confirming that she accepted the criticisms, in which she said:

The fact is that there is only one desk on which the little sign sits saying, `The buck stops here'.

         I reject, and the Opposition rejects, this Minister's summary of the issue as simply being a matter of whether she had seen the material before she signed an endorsement of that material. Indeed, the reverse is almost true. It seems to me that if the busy Minister had laboured late into the night and read another pile of paper and missed some minor point and then given an endorsement, it would be footling for us to be criticising her. I suppose all of us would say that at times we make mistakes and at times we do not read something as fully as we might like, but this is a far clearer case. This is a case in which the Minister signed a blank cheque and handed it to her Department. The officers could fill in $10; they could fill in $1m; they could fill in $1 billion—no-one was going to look.

         If it is the Prime Minister's idea that it is an adequate exercise of ministerial responsibility for the Minister to address the envelope and commend the contents without reading what is going into the envelope, for her to provide her Department, her officials or consultants—whoever it was who did the physical task—with a blank cheque to say to the people of Australia and, more importantly, to the school children of Australia anything that they like because she as Minister intends not to actually cast her eye over it and to check in her own mind and with trusted advisers that this is material which is fit to publish; if that is the idea that this Minister and Prime Minister have of ministerial responsibility, it is not the idea which we have of ministerial responsibility. I say to the Minister that it is simply not good enough to accept that the theatre of office is enough; the substance of office is what you are here to do. You are responsible for it, and if you are not prepared to accept that responsibility, I say you should go and do something else.

Unfortunately, that just generally reflects the attitude that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has taken on the environment in the last two years in which he has been shadow Minister for the environment. Never once in this House have I had a substantive question from the honourable member for Pearce in relation to any major policy issue. Every single question that I have received from him has related to processes, never to substantive policy.

         The fundamental point is—and I have made this point many times before in this House—that I had not seen or approved the contents of the World Environment Day kit before it was printed and dispatched to schools, to parliamentary colleagues such as yourselves, and to other groups. That began on 4 May. What happened is that clearly there was a breakdown in the basic departmental procedures which should have been followed for the approval of material such as this.

         On Wednesday, 27 May, after I had fully examined the kit, after I had asked for a report from my Department and after I had spoken to a number of people, I determined that the kit was in fact biased, inaccurate and unbalanced. In fact I agreed with some of the points that were made by the honourable member for Pearce and that is exactly why I took the action I did. I took that action because I believed that the document was inaccurate, biased and unbalanced. So at the opportunity that I had to act on this, I did. I directed that the kit be withdrawn. The Department has since written to recipients of the kit requesting that it be withdrawn and not used.

         They are the simple facts. When I answered the question on this last week I indicated that neither I nor my office had seen nor approved the contents of the kit before it was printed and dispatched. That is just a truth. The honourable member for Pearce then asked me whether I was in the habit of endorsing these documents that I had not seen. I said then that I endorsed the cover and not the contents which, I repeated, neither I nor my office had seen. I had seen the letter on the cover; I had not seen the contents. That is the central point: neither I nor my office nor appropriate departmental officers at senior level had seen the content of the kit before it was printed and dispatched.

         I say again that the central point is: what action did I take? As soon as I had the facts drawn to my attention that it had not been through appropriate processes, and after I had examined it, I actually agreed with some of the points that had been made. There were some inaccuracies. I believed it was unbalanced. Why do I say that it was unbalanced? It is primarily because I believe the Government has done a lot better than is advocated in that kit, particularly in areas such as land care. In fact, there have been enormous achievements in the last few years in relation to the issue of land degradation. Governments, farmers, conservationists and local communities have joined forces to become one of the most cooperative and enthusiastic responses to an environmental problem in this country. It is what we call, I suppose, a bottom-up approach because it has empowered landowners to act, and the Commonwealth has played a coordinating and strategic role. The Government has put a lot of money into it. It has set aside $320m as part of its decade of land care. We have about 220 Landcare groups operating throughout Australia. These are very positive achievements and I do not believe that the kit provided enough emphasis on those positive achievements.

         In fact, as a result of some of the complaints I had from the farmers about the operation of my programs and how they were coordinated with those of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), we reformed the whole process in response to their requests because we believe that that program has been so successful and that nothing should stand in the way of its continuing to operate.

It is not an outcome that all of us in Australia are particularly thrilled about. It is not the ultimate.

         The Minister quite clearly states that this kit was dispatched to all members and to all schools around Australia. I notice that she is leaving the chamber. She is not even prepared to hear the comments from members of the Opposition. Having dispatched the kit on 4 May, it took until 27 May for her to withdraw her endorsement. The key argument that the honourable member for Pearce and I are putting forward is that because of a photo opportunity, because the cover looked good, and because she is the `Minister for publicity', she was keen to write `Ros' at the bottom of her photograph on the outside cover, but was not willing to check the contents. She endorsed the cover, not the contents. What a wonderful quote. She is on the public record and she has not denied that situation in the House this afternoon.

         I first raised this matter by way of a widely distributed press release on 15 May—some time after the launch of the document. In it I raised the problems of the interpretation of the forestry industries and the motor car industry, and the slant that was given by way of this particular kit. On 19 May I sent out another press release. I contacted and spoke to members of the forest industries. I said, `What do you think about this?'. They opened the document, looked at the pages and the little cartoons and said, `It is not too good, is it?' The forest industries are on the public record as saying that it is `an appallingly infantile document'. That was their response. The car industry was horrified at the `Dodgy Motor Corporation' and the concept that that conveyed to all Australians, particularly young Australians.

In that letter it was said that the forest segment of that document was full of inaccuracies; it was derogatory to the people in the south-eastern forest area; the logging debate—which I will refer to in a minute—was very kindergarten, to say the least; and mention was made of the $1 billion worth of debt.

        We have all this misinformation about what might be going on in other countries, but what obviously is not going on in Australia. The environmental education kit talks about the motor car industry. It shows a wonderful little cartoon about the Dodgy Motor Corp. The document says to all Australian school children, `You have been employed as an environmental consultant'. School children could perhaps go to the Ford Motor Co. in Geelong and ask, `What is going on here?'. They could ask about the positive and negative effects, about what is happening to the atmosphere, the water, and living standards. So it goes on. This document portrays people who work in the Ford Motor Co. in Dandenong, Broadmeadows or Geelong as almost second-class citizens. It does not quite say that, but it would seem to imply that it is the way the Minister—or her document, because she never looked at it—would view it.

         I understand DITAC was aware of the situation. There was some discussion about the Minister's kit not being very well received by the motor industry. Obviously some memorandums would have been circulating. There was an interdepartmental briefing, as I understand it, so the departments would have been aware of the concerns of the motor industry at that time. There were warnings and there was disquiet. Everyone would have been aware of what was going on.

         Even as late as today I made some investigations—the honourable member for Pearce has raised this issue—about what has happened to the kits that have been distributed. A range of figures has been mentioned—between $50,000 and $100,000—while the postage and production costs have not been mentioned. I made some inquiries of Kwikasair, which has been engaged by the Minister as the mailing house responsible for preparing the Minister's letter asking for withdrawal of the kit. This letter was sent to Australia Post for delivery today. Schools will not receive this letter until tomorrow, at least—or later in country areas. Kwikasair has not received any instructions from the Minister or the Department as to how these kits are to be returned.

         The Minister said that she does not endorse the kit. Yet the kits are out in the schools and no instruction has been given about the kits being returned. Does this mean that the schools will have to destroy them? Does it mean that the school children will be prevented from believing what they had already been told between 4 May and 27 May, when the Minister disowned the kit, or will they accept that some of what I read out are facts of life? What will be the cost of the mailing? What is the cost of the printing? Those matters have not been answered yet.

         The final thing to which I draw the attention of honourable members is the kit's list of organisations—very respectable organisations—which people can get some information from. If people have any doubts about the kit, they can just talk to these organisations which are listed at the back of the kit. The Australian Conservation Foundation—a very reliable group which has some sensible views—will help people if they are in a little trouble. The Animal Liberation group in Newtown, New South Wales, will also help people out if they are in any doubt as to what is in the kit. Another group which will help is the Australian Association for Environmental Education. I do not know what this group is about, but, of course, it would be able to help people.

         —Thank you for your call, Mr Speaker. Evidently it is a bit difficult to get up and speak in this place—about two minutes of my time has been used up in this debate. The Opposition has to do one thing in a charge against a Minister on the question of ministerial responsibility. In this particular debate in this chamber it has to establish, in a clear-cut fashion and with evidence, not that the Minister ought to have read something, not that the content of what it is that she ought to have read is unacceptable, but that she actually read it at a time other than that which she claimed in the House and, subsequently, dealt with a particular problem which arose with the pamphlet.

         In my view, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) made a convincing case that this pamphlet was produced by a dill. What the honourable member for Corangamite did not make a case about was that the work of that public servant, consultant or whoever was associated with it did arrive and was read by Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) prior to the time that she announced that it had been read and was dealt with by her.

         The same goes for the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who spoke earlier. Again, he made a case that what was in the pamphlet was untoward, not appropriate, deceitful and likely to mislead young people in this country if it were placed in their hands. He said all of that; but the honourable member failed to establish in this chamber that the Minister had read it. Indeed, I do not think that any claim will come forward from the Opposition that the Minister who is the subject of this censure had in fact read it. Those opposite make a claim that she ought to have read it; they make a claim that her office ought to have read it and drawn it to her attention; but they have not actually made a claim that she did read it. If they cannot establish that she did read it there is not any point discussing this censure motion in this place.

There is absolutely nothing that the honourable member for Pearce can claim in regard to the performance of this Minister that makes her in any way, shape or form liable to a charge of misleading the House.

         I can recollect a certain taxation commissioner writing repeatedly to Treasurers and Attorneys-General, drawing their attention to repeated breaches of the taxation Act in the so-called bottom of the harbour scheme. So much so that when the Treasurer of the day finally came clean and tabled the correspondence, he produced a document of Sydney telephone book dimensions. Much of this correspondence had in fact been drawn to his attention, I would have thought providing ample evidence of the fact that he had failed in a duty of care as far as his portfolio was concerned.

I will quote him. Even though the Opposition, at the urging of the Crichton-Browne faction in Western Australia, has purged him from his position as shadow Attorney-General, it might nevertheless reflect on his words, because it evidently thought him good enough to hang on to when it was in office and to keep him on the front bench for a very long time while it has been in Opposition.

I believe as I have said before, that the Minister should be judged on the response that is made when there is mismanagement or when bungling occurs in his Department, and that he cannot be expected to know, in this day and age about all the matters taking place in his Department. He is to be judged by the way in which he acts and the way that the Government acts when such a matter is brought to his attention and I believe the Government's record in response to this matter should find favour with the Senate.

All of this was happening and the present Opposition was saying `Well, you know: big departments, big problems. We are not really terribly responsible for any of those things'.

As a result of that she got quite a nice little note from the NFF. I will read from part of it. It states:

         The shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Pearce, was the Minister for Social Security for a period. The Department of Social Security is a substantial department of state. He knows as well as I do—I too have been responsible over time for some very big departments of state—that as Ministers we are frequently called upon to write endorsements for particular programs. As a Minister, I constantly write endorsements for training manuals. As Defence Minister I wrote endorsements for manuals associated with defence sales and contracting. There is an expectation now in the Public Service—in the plethora of publications that it produces; not the odd one or two documents each year—that the Ministers of the day will give documents their imprimatur by signing letters to them.

That would be an extraordinary waste of time. What Ministers rely on, and reasonably rely on, is that we have appropriate people in place in the departments to run constant checks through the system on material that is being handed up so that there is a reasonable total level of veracity in the matters that will be put forward. We are entitled to expect that of our public servants. Any government is entitled to expect that of its public servants. The Public Service, if it is nothing else, is at least a hierarchy for a chain of approval. At some point of time something that is going out into the public will hit a desk of someone senior enough for us to be absolutely convinced that a commonsense approach has been adopted to the particular item that is released.

I am afraid that it is not sufficient for the honourable member for Corangamite to say that, because he puts out regular press releases on these things, the Minister must have seen it. I have news for the honourable member for Corangamite: we do not actually spend a great deal of our time reading the press releases put out by Opposition members. Press releases are like training manuals; we get half a dozen a day of the damn things. We could not say with absolute certainty at all that even our staff read every single press release that comes out.

         I must say that when, on the very rare occasion, I have drawn to my attention an Opposition spokesman's statement on some public matter, be it the environment, education or anything else, I find that for its lack of veracity, incompetence and total ineptitude such a statement makes even the dill that produced this particular paper look like Einstein. The fact that honourable members opposite produce the odd press release on these matters is not enough to make a case against the Minister. There is not any case. That is obvious from the fact that nobody around here gives a darn about this debate. It is one of the quietest, weakest censure motions I have ever had the lack of pleasure to respond to in this House. To end it for all honourable members, I move:

         —This is a report by the Privileges Committee concerning a letter received by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). The facts can be stated briefly. On behalf of a constituent, the honourable member for Aston wrote to a government department in terms which, inter alia, were critical of a public servant. He received a letter of demand from solicitors acting for the public servant, and the matter was referred to the Privileges Committee.

         The full facts concerning the particular incident are set out in the report which has already been tabled in the House. Section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act provides as follows:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this case the Committee was therefore asked to determine under the terms of the Parliamentary Privileges Act two particular questions: whether the conduct of the solicitors concerned amounted, or was intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the exercise by the honourable member for Aston of his functions, and whether the honourable member for Aston had been, in the course of writing the letter, freely performing his duties as a member.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In this case the Committee had no difficulty in determining the question of what constitutes the free performance by a member of a member's duties. Specifically, it had no difficulty finding that one of a member's duties is to represent constituents to a Minister or to a government department. In this case that is what the honourable member for Aston had been doing, and in doing so had been performing the duties of a member.

         The more difficult part for the Committee was to determine what constitutes improper interference with those duties. The word `improper' is a wonderful word for draftsmen. It is easy to say in a statute, `You should not do something that is improper'. The hard thing is to say what is and what is not improper. Saying, `You shall not do something that is improper' is like saying in a statute, `Don't do the wrong thing'. The hard part is to say what the wrong thing actually is.

         The difficulty the Committee and I, as a member of that Committee, had in this case was in saying that the letter of 13 February from the solicitors was improper. The gist of the letter is that it asserts that a libel has been committed; it demands an apology for alleged libel; and it foreshadows legal proceedings if that apology is not given. Any citizen in our society has the right to invoke the legal process and invoke laws against any person. It is very difficult to say that taking, or threatening to take, the legal process is improper.

         If proceedings had been taken against the honourable member for Aston, and if the words were found to be libellous—of course I make no comment on that—the court would undoubtedly have had to determine whether qualified privilege operated as a defence. In ascertaining whether qualified privilege applied in this particular case, the court would ask itself questions such as whether the honourable member for Aston had a duty to make the representation, and whether those who received it had an interest in receiving it. The court would effectively determine where the duty of members commenced and where it ended in representing constituents.

         In my opinion that is not solely a matter for courts to determine. It is also a matter that the Parliament has a vital interest in determining. The Parliament has an interest in determining what the duties of honourable members are, and what they are not. In this case, I believe it was incumbent upon the Committee—and through it this House—to determine that the duty of a member of parliament does run to representing complaints of constituents to departments, and that it would seriously impair the functioning of the Parliament if honourable members were liable for defamation in re-publishing complaints of constituents to government or, even if they were not liable for defamation in re-publishing complaints of constituents, that they would be subject to long and expensive court proceedings to establish that right to re-publish complaints of constituents.

         It would inhibit the free performance of members' duties if, every time they re-published the complaint of a constituent, they were forced into legal proceedings in the court to establish that right. Honourable members would, out of caution, cease making representations of complaints about the performance of departments. Even passing them on would amount to re-publication and could give rise to proceedings for defamation.

         Although the Committee in its finding did not pick up the wording of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act and unequivocally say that the threat to invoke the legal process was improper, it did assert that it is the duty of members of the Parliament to represent constituents, and it did assert that it did not consider it in the public interest for that process to grind to a halt under the burden of anticipated or threatened proceedings for libel. I believe that by accepting this report the Parliament should, and will, state its view that, for the benefit of constituents—not for the benefit of members of parliament—it asserts the right of members of parliament to be able to re-publish by passing on their grievances to government departments. That is what the report has done.

         In the course of writing this report and deliberating on this complaint, I have read a number of previous determinations as to what does and does not constitute a contempt or a breach of privilege. May I observe that there is now a much greater reluctance on the part of the Parliament to find breaches of privilege than was the case in the past. I welcome that view in so far as it is a determination that members of parliament should be loath to assert privileges to which ordinary citizens are not entitled. By the same token, we should remember that the privilege of the Parliament is not for the sake of the members of the Parliament; it is a privilege accorded to an institution, asserted for the benefit of the public. In this case it is asserted for the benefit of constituents to give them the right to have their complaints represented to government and government departments without that process grinding to a halt under threatened or impending legal cases.

         The privilege of the Parliament is not a right that the members of the Parliament can give away. It is a right that constituents hold, and it is a right that ought to be protected for the sake of constituents, not for the sake of members of parliament. The Committee concluded that the letter in this case had a tendency to impair the independence of the honourable member for Aston. It is a finding that says that, as far as the Parliament is concerned, the honourable member for Aston was engaging in the performance of the duties of a member of parliament by re-publishing to a government department the complaints of a constituent and by representing the claims of that constituent to a government department for further investigation.

         If the Parliament itself makes a finding that it considers this to be the performance of a member's duty, and if it also makes a finding that it believes it would not be in the public interest, nor in the interests of constituents for that to be inhibited, I trust that it will resolve the matter. I believe that the Privileges Committee—and through the Privileges Committee, this House—had the obligation to make that finding, and I hope that explains why that finding was made.

         Briefly, the details of the matter are that on 25 February this year I raised this matter of privilege in connection with a letter dated 13 February 1992 received by me from Dwyer and Co., solicitors, acting on behalf of a named public servant. Mr Speaker considered this matter on 26 February 1992 and stated that he was satisfied that a prima facie case existed such as would warrant precedence being granted to a motion in respect of the matter. I then moved the following motion, which was agreed to by the House:

       <para>
        I will briefly outline the circumstances that led to that motion. On 27 September last year a constituent, Mr Paul Radisich, came to my Melbourne office seeking assistance in respect of an application he had made concerning training allowances and other matters. Mr Radisich stated that he had been to the Department of Social Security in Ringwood, in Melbourne, and at various times had received erroneous and conflicting advice from different members of DSS staff.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr Radisich asked for the DSS advice to be put in writing. The matter was referred to Mrs Lana Spearing, a supervisor. Mr Radisich stated that Mrs Spearing subsequently telephoned him and told him that he would not receive the information requested in writing and that he was to stop bothering the DSS. Mr Radisich complained to me that Mrs Spearing was rude in her manner, and he specifically requested that his complaint regarding Mrs Spearing's rudeness be referred to the Minister for Social Security.

         Subsequent events showed that Mrs Spearing was employed by the Department of Employment, Education and Training at the Commonwealth Employment Service in Ringwood and not by the Department of Social Security. However, being unaware of this at the time, I wrote to the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, on 4 October 1991, as requested by Mr Radisich, my constituent. Subsequently, I received a letter from the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, advising me that the matter had been referred to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, as Mrs Spearing was employed by that Department.

         I believe it is quite clear from my letter that it was addressed to the Minister and not to the Department, as alleged by Dwyer and Co.—it was addressed to the Minister by name—and quite clear that I was conveying an allegation of my constituent.

         On the afternoon of 18 February 1992 I received in my Melbourne office a facsimile letter dated 13 February 1992—in other words, five days earlier—from Dwyer and Co., solicitors, on behalf of their client Mrs Lana Spearing. The letter stated that Mrs Spearing denied that she had been rude to Mr Radisich and that an internal departmental investigation had cleared her of any impropriety. Dwyer and Co's letter stated that the allegations of rudeness appeared in my letter as a statement of fact and that the damage done by the letter went beyond personal hurt to their client and extended to her reputation within the workplace.

As the letter from Dwyer and Co. was dated 13 February 1992 but only sent to me by facsimile on 18 February, I effectively had only 48 hours in which to respond to their demands.

         I believe that I have a right and a duty to correspond with Ministers on matters affecting my constituents which they have raised with me. This may include, from time to time, putting forward allegations made to me by those constituents. This, it seems to me, is the very essence of the qualified privilege that protects members of this place when communicating with Ministers on behalf of their constituents. Members of parliament must be free to carry out their duties without the threat of interference or intimidation. Of course, there needs to be a balance between the rights of members and the rights of citizens. In this case I merely forwarded a complaint of a constituent to a Minister and sought an investigation. Any release or publication of that information did not come from me or from my office.

         I submit that the timing of the subsequent Dwyer and Co. facsimile on 18 February 1992, its stated deadline for response and its content constituted an attempt to intimidate me as a member of this Parliament. When I received the Dwyer and Co. facsimile, I contacted the office of the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), to try to establish what actions his Department had taken, but had received no response at the time that I raised this matter in the House.

         It is clear in my mind that the Committee has found that, as we have just heard from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the complaint is covered by section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, that there has been a breach and that my raising of this matter was justified. The Committee concludes its report by stating:

        In the present case, although the person or persons responsible for the letter dated 13 February from Dwyer and Company to Mr Nugent may have acted without a full knowledge of the legal and related issues involved, and although the person or persons may not have intended to intimidate or to influence Mr Nugent in an improper way, the terms of the letter and the circumstances of its receipt had a tendency to impair Mr Nugent's independence in the performance of his duties.

        The words `tendency to impair Mr Nugent's independence in the performance of his duties' clearly demonstrate that the Committee has found the complaint to be covered by section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. Whilst I did not wish to infringe on any citizen's rights, I did feel somewhat constrained by the time scale requirements of the letter from Dwyer and Co. in this case. Therefore, I felt that I had no other recourse but to bring this matter before this House.

I urge that the community as a whole take note of the findings of this Committee. My complaint was appropriate not only in the interests of my own constituents and any future action by me on their behalf, but also so that other members of this place will not be subjected to such pressures in future. In summary, I am pleased that the findings of the Committee have vindicated my action. I urge all honourable members to be vigilant in such matters in the future.

         It is always very difficult in a privileges committee to assess the extent to which what is one of the most sacred and important rights of this place should be exercised. I respect the conclusions reached by the Committee, although I have some reservations about parts of them. I want to address some omissions which concern me. First of all, though, I feel that perhaps undue significance was placed upon some parts of the complaint raised by the honourable member for Aston—certainly in so far as the timing of the receipt of the fax is concerned. It seems unusual and I think it put him in an invidious position, but I think that is irrelevant to the fundamental question. The fundamental question, to me, is that the person on whose behalf the honourable member for Aston wrote the complaint was not an ordinary citizen. In fact, that person was a public servant.

         It is difficult for us as parliamentarians to place our responsibilities into true perspective.

We have an instance before us only this day of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) seeking to hide behind a cloud of what others do on her behalf. The important part about our charge as parliamentarians is that, whatever the responsibilities of ombudsmen, one of our prime duties is to act as an intermediary between the citizen and the Government.

        We are not just talking in this matter raised by the honourable member for Aston about a citizen; we are talking about a public servant. We are talking about a person whose responsibility is set down under those Public Service regulations. I will not read paragraphs (f), (g), (h) or (i), although they are all relevant, because they are not specifically to do with the point I seek to make—that is, that a person who is acting on behalf of the government or of this Parliament in that role of the Public Service as an intermediary between the government and the citizen has an unduly high burden of responsibility. It is not just of a citizen that the honourable member for Aston wrote; he wrote specifically regarding a public servant. I repeat:

        One of the things that concern me about the report of the Privileges Committee is that we are told only by the letter that the honourable member received that apparently there had been no charge of impropriety found against the particular public servant to whom the letter from the honourable member for Aston referred. What did he say? He said:

       </para>
       <para>
        I am not too sure whether rudeness is impropriety. Certainly it fits within the definition in the Public Service Act. But of course there are other obligations. I understand that public servants are also required to accept the obligations under part 6 of the Crimes Act. There are certain obligations that flow from that, and there is some reference in the data before us to those obligations. From my reading of this material prior to speaking this afternoon, I can see absolutely no basis for that solicitor's letter. As far as I am concerned, the letter from the honourable member for Aston quite properly set out the complaint on behalf of a constituent. I regard that as one of the prime rights of members of this Parliament.

         Of course, if we put it into another perspective—that is, the extent to which the Parliament needs to assert its continued role and relevance—it worries me to a greater degree. Part of the problem that we see in this whole sad instance, as the honourable member for Aston mentioned, is that he has not been advised of this internal departmental inquiry. In fact, most of his correspondence has been ignored altogether by Ministers. As far as I am concerned, if I get a letter from ministerial staff, I do not regard that as getting a letter from a Minister. I send it back quite often and say, `When I hear from the Minister, I will take it as a response; in the meanwhile, I do not accept that as being appropriate'. I certainly do not accept it as appropriate for a proper member's inquiry. Nobody is suggesting that this inquiry was other than correct. Indeed, the report of the Privileges Committee confirms that it was correct and proper. So why the devil do we have a finding which suggests that the honourable member might have been partly guilty?

         I was quite disappointed in the findings of the Privileges Committee, for I feel that it is important that honourable members retain the capacity to suggest that those who act on the Government's behalf, and particularly in face to face inquiries with the public, act in a proper fashion, as those Public Service Regulations require. I know that public servants have a difficult job in many instances. I know that we have some very diligent, honest and hardworking public servants. But all of us have had experience of some who, unfortunately, seem to treat their responsibilities in far too light-hearted a fashion. There are many who do not treat members of the public as equals but in some manner as underlings: for example, the queues in some of the departmental offices of people trying hard to put a point of view, and the extent to which they are treated as numbers. They are dealt with almost as sausages. I just do not regard that as acceptable. This Privileges Committee report goes to the very heart of that.

         There is also some suggestion that there is something untoward in the honourable member for Aston having written to the wrong Minister and that therefore he has transgressed in his responsibility. I just do not accept that. In this place we are flat out keeping up with who is Minister for what and when and for how long. It is impossible to know just in which area and to what degree particular Ministers have which particular responsibility. We have a fair example of this at the moment. We do not have a Minister in the House; we have a Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton) is responsible for nothing. He gets the perks and lurks but has no responsibility. I say to my friend that I do not accept that as being responsible. He is not responsible for a department. Our Constitution requires that a Minister should be responsible for a department. He is there as an appendage, a hope that he might be able to keep voting the right way at the right time. Be honest. That is all it is about. He does not have the responsibility. There is not a Minister in the House. Ministers are inclined to pass up their responsibility in order to get on with what they see as their main political game of trying to retain power.

         I regard this particular Privileges Committee report in a rather sad way because I think the responsibility of the public servant was not brought out. I think it is unfortunate that there has been some suggestion that the honourable member for Aston in some way was negligent in not knowing the right Minister to whom the letter should be addressed. As far as I am concerned, the Minister to whom he wrote the letter is only exercising responsibility which is delegated to him by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The direct line goes through the Prime Minister. Whichever Minister we address, there should be absolute confidentiality about the way in which such matters are pursued.

         The fact that there has been publication, as the solicitors assert, I think is quite irrelevant because it has not been publication by the honourable member; it has been publication by the honourable member only to the degree that he is exercising his responsibilities as a member of parliament to a responsible Minister. That it was not the responsible Minister is irrelevant. It is very important that people understand that.

         It is also important that people understand that when a person writes to us we pass on that representation. Some of us might use some language which attributes every sentence and every word to the person making the representation. But I do not think it is on to suggest that in some way the honourable member for Aston was negligent because he did not exactly and precisely define that every one of the words that he used were the words of the constituent. What the honourable member was doing was telling the Minister that there was a complaint about the manner in which an officer of his Department was conducting her responsibilities. That was a proper exercise of his responsibility. In my view it was not an area, therefore, where there should be any capacity for lawyers to write to the honourable member, as the lawyers have in this instance, and suggest that they were about to commence litigation against him.

         A number of conclusions can be drawn from this. In my brief time left, I will just refer to paragraph 27 of the Chairman's report. I feel that it is quite improper for wider publicity not to be given to the extent to which public servants have a duty of care and a duty beyond that of an ordinary citizen. I believe it improper for members of the legal profession not to be told that letters of this sort, which threaten legal action because a member has been exercising his responsibilities, should themselves therefore be a breach of privilege. In my view this matter was a breach of privilege. I believe there was a circumstance where there should have been a call from this Parliament to that firm of solicitors to apologise to the honourable member. Had that been undertaken, justice would have been done. As it is, there is a cloud left over the head of the honourable member for Aston which is totally unjustified and which I believe reflects against the integrity, capacity and ability of every member of this Parliament to undertake his or her chosen and legal responsibilities.

I did not intend to speak on this matter but I think it is important to say, on behalf of the other members of the Privileges Committee, that we did find a breach of privilege. It is up to the right honourable member for New England or anyone else in this Parliament to take appropriate action as a result of the report of that Committee. We made it very clear that we thought that there was a breach of privilege. If the right honourable member wants anyone to be called on to apologise, he can move a motion to that effect in this chamber.

         It may well be that honourable members should reflect on the way in which they make complaints on behalf of constituents. I have probably done what the honourable member for Aston did and quoted a person—perhaps not in inverted commas—as saying that someone was rude, totally unfair or highly abusive. I may not have indicated that I was communicating a view of a person which I had not necessarily proven to my own satisfaction. In no way do I feel that the honourable member for Aston has acted improperly. I feel that he was carrying out his normal duties in a proper way.

         It is not a reasonable request for the right honourable member for New England to ask the Privileges Committee to judge whether a public servant was rude or not, particularly when it was given direction by the Speaker for a specific purpose.

         The right honourable member mentioned that there is an unduly high responsibility on public servants. He mentioned that there was no charge of impropriety against the public servant.

         I recall a court hearing in the United Kingdom where a hairdresser attacked his employee—punched the employee in the face, kicked the employee across the room, kicked the employee in the groin and then said that he would take further action outside and deal with the matter properly. The employee accused the employer of unfair dismissal. The court found that there was unfair dismissal—probably quite rightly. Assumptions were made. Similarly, action can be taken, appropriately, either here in this chamber or outside if it is felt that action ought to be taken against a public servant. But I just repeat that there is no way that I as a member of the Privileges Committee feel that the honourable member for Aston was partly guilty. Also we were not asked to judge a public servant; we were asked to judge whether the action of the solicitor involved undue pressure.

         I want to say briefly that there is a serious problem growing up with respect to members of parliament and their capacity to do their duty. Litigation is the name of the game in the law at the moment. Litigation to protect people from public discussion or from reasonable debate seems to be being facilitated by the courts because of the situation that exists whereby a contempt of the court can exist where a person who has litigation raised against him makes comment on the subject matter in a public arena. We have the right to make a comment in this Parliament, but that is a limited right. Most of the debate on issues takes place outside this place, as honourable members know.

We have already seen the situation where the Privacy Commissioner has laid down rules which are serious inhibitions to members. I think it would be quite improper for this House to allow a situation to develop where there could be any doubt whatsoever that people are able to come to a member of parliament with a complaint about the actions of a public servant or any other person who is publicly responsible to this Parliament and have that member raise the matter with the head of the department, the Minister or whoever it may be.

         The Committee has clearly found that there is a breach of privilege, and I support that decision. I am somewhat concerned that no penalty is recommended because I believe that, if a breach of privilege is found, there has to be some response to it, even if it is a written apology to the Parliament. There should be some response. There is a growing belief by people in the community that going to their member of parliament will not result in any action. Here is a case where the honourable member took action. I do not know whether I agree with his action or not because I have not read his letters. But the fact is that, if someone comes to me, I consider it my responsibility, where it is reasonable for me to do so, to transmit the matter. I will not pass on information from dobbers and that type of thing; I tell them that they can do that themselves. But, where a person has a legitimate complaint or what appears to be a legitimate complaint, I feel it is my job to pass on the details, and I think that every member of this House has the same responsibility.

         —I shall not keep the House very long either but, from the time the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) raised this issue in the House, I have been concerned about it. It brought to mind an incident in Queensland some years ago when the then member for Salisbury, Rosemary Kyburz, had occasion to complain to the Queensland Legislative Assembly. She was a fairly feisty lady who was not easily intimidated. There is a similarity in this case. It is not exactly the same, but it is only a pretty short step from her experience to the one that the honourable member for Aston has had. I hand it as a caution to all members and pick up on the concern expressed by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair).

         Mrs Kyburz was a Liberal backbench member in the days of the National-Liberal Party coalition Government in Queensland. She had written a letter of complaint about a public servant to a State Minister in a very similar sort of case to that raised by the honourable member for Aston. The Minister, who was a National Party Minister, handed that letter directly to the public servant concerned. The next Mrs Kyburz knew was that she received a letter very similar to the one written to the honourable member for Aston.

         This letter from the honourable member for Aston seems to have gone through certain channels. Nevertheless, in the end, it ended up in the hands of a solicitor who threatened legal action. It is not such a large step from that situation to the one which arose in Queensland. Mrs Kyburz had raised the matter rather indignantly in the State Parliament and her complaint received rather widespread coverage in the popular media. As far as I know, that was the end of the subject. However, there was no doubt in anyone's mind about what was going on.

         The next point I would like to raise is that there is surely some responsibility on the legal profession in this country to acquaint itself with the subject of parliamentary privilege when one of its members is instructed to write such a letter. I would like to recount another little episode which is in a rather different vein. There is a major legal firm in Brisbane which used to be my solicitors when I lived in Brisbane and which has linkages with another major legal firm in Sydney. I mention that I had a professional relationship with this firm when I lived in Brisbane. I have, on several occasions, received through the mail from a partner in that firm, who was my solicitor, papers and documents that are drawn up between these two firms in Sydney and Brisbane on subjects that he thinks might interest me as a member of parliament.

         One was on the subject of defamation laws and members of parliament. Another one that I received, with him inviting my comment, had to do with privilege and defamation. There was a statement in that paper that they were circulating between the firms which was actually incorrect. It was claimed that, if one circulates an extract from
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         in which defamatory allegations are made, because of parliamentary privilege defamation action cannot be taken, whereas it might be taken if the same allegations were made outside the Parliament. That is not true. There are limitations on the privilege of a
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         extract in defamation matters. It is all a matter, as I understand it, of the intent of the person who caused that extract to be circulated or disseminated.

         It seemed to me that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) was saying that we have another option as members of parliament when these allegations are made, and that is the option of raising the subject in the House instead of writing to the Minister. If I correctly understood him, I would see that as an option some way down the track, except in very extreme circumstances. I think the honourable member for Aston very properly did not raise it in the House without having first of all written to the Minister about his constitutent's complaint and given the Minister an opportunity to respond. If he had been desperately unhappy with that response—as he should have been in this case when this public servant was apparently exonerated unbeknown to anybody else who was involved in the allegation—then he could have well raised it in the House, and properly, if that had been his choice. But I do not see raising the subject in the House as necessarily the clear-cut alternative that might be suggested.

I was quite dismayed by the behaviour of this employee and, as a member of parliament, I thought I really could not let this go, so I asked to speak to the supervisor. It took me over 10 minutes to get that connection. I was very rudely—again—put on hold by the employee, who knew very well I was about to complain about her, and just left hanging there.

I said to the supervisor that I really did not think she could say that I was wrong without at least hearing what my complaint was. Part of my complaint was the extraordinary rudeness of this woman, this Telecom employee, to me. She said, `Oh, no, she is never rude'. I said, `How do you know that?', as she had not heard the conversation. Anyway, I was dismissed. I was left somewhat dissatisfied by the process of investigation of a complaint on that occasion.

I would caution the House against the sort of qualifications that came out in this report, because there could be rather more serious implications further down the line if we do not accept that the honourable member for Aston behaved entirely properly and the legal firm in this case quite inappropriately.

Quite clearly, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) did no more than that. I note the suggestion that his letter got to `the wrong department'. I hope that is something that I am never found guilty of, as I have to say that occasionally I write letters that get to `the wrong department'. To suggest that in some way the honourable member for Aston is liable because that was his failing is totally unreasonable.

         The simple fact is that Australia seems to be drifting towards the American example of litigiousness, and that is unfortunate. I deplore the fact that members of parliament too frequently refer to the laws of libel when they should be a bit more rough and tough and cop it, as long as the statements are not extremely derogatory. Some of the stuff that is exchanged by members of parliament, be it in the press or elsewhere, is the sort of thing we should be big enough to handle—as should members of the Public Service when, as in this instance, a member is only referring a constituent's complaint to their superiors.

         As the honourable member for Corio said, we all have to make some judgments about the bona fides of people who come to our offices, and I respect the ability of the honourable member for Aston to make those judgments. He is a man of considerable experience in business prior to his coming to this place. I expect that most members of this place, if not all, would have considerable ability to make judgments where a complaint is clearly frivolous. That is one of the skills that we learn in this place from our activities as members of parliament. Most of us know when a complaint is totally unreasonable.

         I believe the honourable member for Aston did carry out this particular role and I think the actions of Dwyer and Co., on the instructions of the public servant involved, were a deliberate attempt to intimidate the honourable member for Aston—and, consequently, every member of this House. This is not an issue of party politics; this is an issue of how long we, as members of parliament, are prepared to put up with this sort of intimidation.

         This is an interesting case because it deals with the bureaucracy. I am quite convinced of Sir Humphrey's capacity to intimidate and to influence and I do not think he needs a few lawyers to help him. It is, therefore, an issue of principle: members of this Parliament have to say, `No more'. We have to say it in terms strong enough to make it understood. A few speeches in this place are not enough; there has to be some positive action required of the legal firm. I think my amendment is sufficient in that regard. This legal firm and its colleagues in law around Australia who are contemplating such action in the future should realise that the Parliament could take much more vigorous action if it chose to.

If this procedure continues, we will have every member sitting down and saying to his constituency, `I would love to do something for you, but I am likely to be sued or threatened'. We cannot tolerate that. It is just not a practical situation. All of us know the reasonable limits of what we can say. On the one hand it is ridiculous to suggest that a complaint that somebody in the Public Service had been rude to a constituent would destroy that person's career and, on the other hand, it is a responsibility for people to so complain.

I have written to the proprietor of the company, in his interests I hope, telling him that I was not complaining but that he had better check on who looked at the car because the next time there might be a fault with work done on the engine mountings.

         It is even worse when it relates to a complaint by a member of parliament on behalf of a constituent. We have a responsibility. We offer ourselves for election on the ground that we will represent the interests of members of the public, that we will protect them from the massive bureaucracy with which they are obliged to deal on a day-to-day basis. It is a situation where honourable members have to make a decision on what they stand for. Fortunately, it is not an issue of party politics.

         —I second the amendment of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I do so, having sat through this debate and listened to the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the other contributors to this debate. Ultimately the question is: what is the appropriate penalty to impose in a situation where the Privileges Committee of this House has come to a clear and unambiguous conclusion about a matter before it; namely, that the terms of the letter and the circumstances of its receipt had a tendency to impair the independence of the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in the performance of his duties? I will not repeat at length the reasons that have been advanced by other members for the importance of preserving the independence of members of this House, but I do believe it is important to recap briefly the circumstances of the case and some of the correspondence relating to it.

         I go back to the initial letter from the honourable member for Aston which ultimately gave rise to this complaint. In the first paragraph of the letter written to Senator Richardson, the then Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Aston said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have received representations from Mr Paul Radisich of Bayswater regarding a matter with the Department of Social Security at Ringwood.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member then said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Radisich has requested that I formally complain about the lack of service he has received and in particular the rudeness of a staff member, Mrs Lana Spearing.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Apparently, Mr Radisich applied . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The letter follows on from there. It would seem clear to any ordinary reader of that letter that the honourable member for Aston was setting out the complaint which he had received from a constituent and that he was bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister for Social Security. In the subsequent paragraph he sets out the basis and the particulars of the complaint. If one then looks at the letter from the solicitors to the honourable member for Aston, one sees their complaint to him. In the third paragraph, they state:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unfortunately, the allegations of rudeness are not prefaced as being Mr. Radisich's but appear in your letter as a statement of fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here we have a firm of solicitors, who have read a letter which their client brings to them in which the honourable member for Aston says that he has been requested to complain formally and then sets out the particulars of that complaint, saying that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unfortunately, the allegations of rudeness are not prefaced as being Mr. Radisich's but appear in your letter as a statement of fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wonder how any firm of solicitors could come to that conclusion. Having been a member of the Bar and having read a few briefs in my life, I can recall letter after letter from firms of solicitors to other parties saying words to the effect, `We act on behalf of Mr and Mrs X who instruct us in this matter. Mr and Mrs X allege that, for example, you have not performed a contract which you entered into'. They then set out the particulars—without saying again in the letter, `We are informed of this particular and we are informed of that particular and we are informed of each and every other particular'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is the exact thing that the honourable member for Aston has done in relation to this matter. How a firm of solicitors can come to that conclusion and somehow allege that `unfortunately the allegations of rudeness are not prefaced'—when already we see in the second paragraph that the honourable member has been requested to complain formally—is beyond me. It is on the basis of having arrived at that interpretation of the situation in the first place that this matter ought to be addressed in terms of the amendment to the motion moved by the honourable member for O'Connor.

         There are indeed other matters of concern that go beyond this particular issue. There is the question of why the letter to the Minister was disseminated so widely in the first place, and this is the allegation of complaint that has been made by the solicitors' client. Why was that concern not directed to the Minister and the Department? Obviously, that was the source of the dissemination of the letter. Why was there not an internal investigation without apparent reference to the honourable member for Aston or to his constituent? In this case, it indicates that the solicitors must have known—or should have known if they had been acting responsibly—that an internal investigation had been carried out. One would presume they knew that the honourable member for Aston had not been asked to provide evidence, or if they did not know that, the question is: why did they not ask their client about those particular matters?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On top of that, we then had two letters from the firm of solicitors on 18 March and 10 April to the Chairman of the Standing Committee of Privileges. On 18 March the solicitors repeated that the honourable member for Aston had made a bland allegation, ignoring the previous paragraph where he said that he was acting upon the formal request of his constituent. In the subsequent letter of 10 April, they moved from that point and said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any question of privilege can only apply where the complaint is made to the correct department.
       </para>
       <para>
        Previous speakers in this debate have indicated the absurdity of that allegation. It suggests to me that the solicitors knew that they were on uncertain ground and were shifting their ground in their subsequent letter to the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges. At the very least, this shows a degree of insensitivity to the issues on the part of the solicitors concerned.

       <para first-indent="16">

         As I said at the outset, the House must address itself to the matter of the appropriate penalty to be imposed. Having found that there is a breach of privilege, the question then is: what should that penalty be? The options in terms of a penalty are the usual options: one can penalise in a manner which involves, for example, some fine or some imprisonment—and I am not suggesting for a moment that that is appropriate in this case. There is also a question of penalty in terms of its deterrent value and deterrence in relation to the general situation of other members of this place, both today and in the future.

         In my opinion, given that the Committee of Privileges has found that there was in fact a breach of privilege and a breach would have the tendency to impair a member's independence in the performance of his or her duties, it is not sufficient to simply arrive at that finding and do nothing more. If one looks at the correspondence from the solicitors concerned, I submit that it shows a lack of understanding of the law in the first place, an insensitivity to the issues concerned in the second place, and a reluctance to face the fact in subsequent correspondence that they might have been wrong and that they had only half of the story. In those circumstances, I join with the honourable member for O'Connor in seconding his amendment, namely:

         The Parliament House Construction Authority was established by the Fraser Government in 1979 as a statutory corporation. Its functions included: firstly, to undertake and carry out the design and construction of Parliament House; secondly, to provide the Government and other parliamentary bodies with information on matters relating to the design and construction of the building; and, thirdly, to undertake the fitting out and furnishing of Parliament House. The Authority was also obligated to undertake any other functions and responsibilities conferred upon it by regulation.

         Interestingly, corporate objectives of the Authority included: to adopt a project management construction system under which the design and construction functions could be carried out in a logical, predetermined and achievable sequence; to adopt a project management construction system which allows the architect to maintain the integrity of design through to the end of the project; to construct Parliament House within the approved building budget, whilst achieving all reasonable economies consistent with the stature and funding of the development and the approved statement of requirements; and, to provide and coordinate non-building items for Parliament House within the approved budget and to a standard consistent with the stature of the building.

         Overall, the Authority has been successful in achieving these objectives, although there is some doubt about the extent to which it has operated within its budgetary constraints. Of course, the Government and the Parliament House Construction Authority will tell us that the project was completed on budget. But this was only because, once costs exceeded the budget, the Authority would seek a new, upwardly revised budget from the Parliament. Hence, the Authority is consistently able to maintain that it did, in fact, bring the project in on budget.

         In spite of this, the Parliament House Construction Authority has been successful in creating a truly magnificent building. This is attested to by over five million visitors who have been through the building in its four years of existence. Constituents from my electorate of Forrest have all been impressed by the building, describing it in a number of ways, including `spectacular' and `splendid'. Many other visitors leave the building feeling overawed by its grandeur and astounded by the pure logistical feat of creating and putting such a structure together. But, importantly, most visitors, including those from my electorate of Forrest, leave the new Parliament House feeling that it is a significant and fitting monument to the freedom and democratic principles of our nation.

         As a member of parliament, I am also appreciative of the building.

Indeed, coming from a very small and cramped office in the old building, I value the spaciousness of my present office. That is not to say that I do not look back on my days in the old building with fondness and some degree of melancholy. Who can forget the sense of closeness of the old Parliament House, its character, or the sense of history which filled every room and corridor?

         In spite of the very pleasant aesthetics of the new Parliament House, there have been a number of hiccups as we have all settled in and as the place has become fully operational. Some of these could not have been helped, such as the annual plague of bogong moths, but others are simply the result of poor planning and construction. The example which springs most readily to mind is the mess-up with the kitchens.

         It was originally intended that all of the food destined for the four dining rooms in the building would be prepared in a central kitchen in the basement, then ferried by lift to the appropriate dining room. Of course, as most members and senators would be aware, the problem with this approach was that because of the considerable distances involved, the food very quickly became cold. The installation of food warmers had little impact. I should point out that, even on something as minor as food warmers, the Parliament House Construction Authority could not get it right. The initial food warmers that were installed could not be used because they had wooden bases and hence were seen to pose a fire hazard. Consequently, a couple of years ago, we saw major construction work being carried out to decentralise the main kitchen. This was at a significant cost to the taxpayer.

         In my view, there is no excuse for this sort of bad planning. It would not, for example, have occurred in the private sector where the purse strings are held considerably more tightly than they appear to have been held by the Parliament House Construction Authority. In fact, in a private development the placement of the kitchen and its implications for the dining room or restaurant would have been considered in the minutest detail to ensure that the requirements of the building occupants were met and that the developer did not lose money. Such basic commercial principles do not appear to have been exercised by the Parliament House Construction Authority.

Most members and senators will have experienced some problems with these very expensive blinds—they either do not open or, if they do, they will not close; they cannot be raised or, if one can get them up, they will not go down; or they simply fall to pieces when one touches them. All these problems have arisen from wooden slat blinds which cost $1,500 each, or nearly $3m for the whole building. A consultant has now been employed to test every one of the 1,875 blinds in the building and to rectify the problems—at a significant cost to the taxpayer, I might add. Again, a little more diligence on behalf of the Parliament House Construction Authority could have prevented this problem and hence the enormous waste of taxpayers' funds. Interestingly, the contract to fix the blinds is one which was outstanding upon the demise of the Authority. Responsibility for the satisfactory completion of the project has been passed over to the Department of Administrative Services.

         The members and senators dining room has also undergone some major construction work since the opening of the building. Apparently the powers that be were not satisfied with the arrangements in the members and senators dining room and, in particular, the partitioning which separated it from the members and senators guests dining room. I point out that most of my colleagues with whom I discussed the matter were happy with the existing arrangements. Nonetheless, the Parliament House Construction Authority set about renovating the area at a cost to the taxpayer of nearly $800,000.

         It was this sort of sloppy planning, of poor workmanship, as well as the stronghold of the trade union movement which led to the massive blow-out in the cost of the new Parliament House. When the project was first announced, a total budget of $200m was allocated. By the time the building was completed, just over $1.2 billion had been spent. It should be noted that this represents just the cost of the construction. It does not include the running or maintenance costs of Parliament House, which are around $35m per year.

         It is interesting to look at a breakdown of the costs involved in the construction and fit-out of this building to see exactly where the blow-outs occurred. The building component of Parliament House accounted for some $920m of the total cost. One of the major increases was to outlays for professional fees. The initial allocation for professional fees was $31m. By the time the project was completed, this had increased to a massive $116m—a cost increase of some 270 per cent.

         Similarly, the global building allocation was initially $37m. This grew to $135m over the life of the project, representing a cost increase of 265 per cent. The amount spent on non-building items was also well over budget. The initial project budget of $71m was earmarked for non-building items. By the time the project was completed, this had nearly doubled to $158m.

The cost of professional fees also grew substantially from its budget of $1.2m to a final cost of nearly $5m. I note that in the 1987-88 and 1988-89 financial years, the Parliament House Construction Authority recorded a loss of nearly $180,000 as a result of the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation.

         More than anything, the blow-out in costs can be attributed to an appalling handling of industrial relations associated with the construction of this building. Indeed, the new Parliament House stands as the greatest monument to industrial relations stupidity in the nation. Its construction brought out the very worst in our industrial relations system, not to mention the most extravagant demands from the trade unions involved. The impact of our industrial relations system on building costs can best be illustrated by a comparison with the record of our international competitors.

         According to a study by Dr Vernon Ireland, the average extension to construction time due to inclement weather and industrial disputes in the United States and the United Kingdom is 4 per cent compared with 20 to 21 per cent in Australia. Time delays in building projects due to bad weather in Australia are, on average, close to three times longer than those experienced by building projects in the United States and the United Kingdom. This is despite more frequent rainfall and sub-zero temperatures in these countries. In Australia, the average extension to construction time because of industrial disputes is between 10 and 12 per cent. In the United States and in the United Kingdom it is zero. Indeed, a basic feature of the United States construction industry is that union agreements include a no-strike clause. Additional time was taken for holidays and rostered days off and in Australia that adds a further 16 per cent to the time of construction, whereas holidays add 2 per cent in the United States and 10 per cent in the United Kingdom.

         As at the end of 1989, industrial disputes had added nearly $80m to the cost of building the new Parliament House. I am sure that none of us will forget the 14-week strike in March and April 1987, which halted work on the building, crippled the Canberra economy and cost the Government over $14m. In fact, in those last couple of years of construction and as the deadline for completion of the building approached, the Government was paying nearly a quarter of a million dollars per week to satisfy union demands and prevent further industrial action.

         The sorts of rorts which led to the payment of these massive costs are already on the public record. However, in this final debate on the new Parliament House, it is prudent to re-state some of the more outrageous. Many honourable members will be aware, for example, that industrial disputes on the site were so frequent that many employees had second jobs, such as driving taxis, running shops or driving trucks. But even in spite of the high dispute rate and all of the time off that employees gained, employers still had a hard time in getting them to turn up to work when they were not on strike. Evidence of this is the $10 per day attendance allowance paid when workers showed up for work.

         According to one contractor who worked on the job, attendance allowances were commonplace. Those contractors who refused to provide the allowance were put under intense union pressure not only to pay but also to back pay. One contractor stated that attendance allowances cost him tens of thousands of dollars. However, paying the attendance allowance did not guarantee that employees would stay at work. The building site was so large that they would turn up in the morning, clock on, then disappear down one of the corridors with a wheelbarrow—not to be seen until the end of the day. In some cases, employees did not even bother to turn up at finishing time; rather, they would get a mate to clock off for them. In fact, the only day that all employees were guaranteed to be on site all day was pay day.

         Often, if it was a nice day or a big game of football was on, one could guarantee that there would be a strike. The trick was to call a strike related to health and safety issues. Employees were known to stay away for two days simply because handrails were missing. Strikes were also called because there was no water in the urn or toilet paper in the toilets.

         Work on the new Parliament House was completed at a snail's pace compared with other sites around the country. Sources who worked on the site said that it took up to a month to dismantle a crane and re-erect it, whereas on other sites around the country the same job was completed in a couple of days. Crane drivers on the new Parliament House building site could only manage to erect two or three panels a day, compared with 20 on other building sites. In addition, crane drivers were paid two hours overtime each day `climbing time' to get into and out of their crane cabs. Curiously, it actually took less than a minute for them to climb in and out of the cab. Crane drivers who were no longer needed to operate their cranes were put to work on fork-lifts, losing their climbing allowance. These drivers went on strike until their climbing allowances were reinstated.

         Featherbedding was rife. Three men were allocated to one crane, while each tradesman had two labourers to carry his plywood to and from the particular work areas. Another non-award issue unique to the Parliament House site was the clothing allowance at the time. It used to cost a contractor more than $200 to outfit an employee for the job. The contractor had to do this regardless of how many days the employee was on the job. If the employee worked on the site for only one day, then left for a new job, not only did he get to keep the clothes, he was also entitled to a set from the contractor on the new job.

         To its credit, towards the end of the construction the Parliament House Construction Authority tried to contain the cost increases resulting from union demands. But to a large extent its hands were tied because of the Government's close relationship with the ACTU and by time constraints involved in getting the building completed in time for the official opening. It was successful in achieving the latter aim. As we all know, the new Parliament House was ready in time for its official opening by the Queen on 9 May 1988.

As such, the Authority closed its offices on 31 August 1990. The Chairman and members of the Authority tendered their resignations to the Governor-General on 28 December 1990. The remaining funding and resources were transferred to the Department of Administrative Services on 1 January 1991. The Authority's offices in State Circle were dismantled and removed in December 1990. This Bill represents the final step in the winding-up process.

         The Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House travelled around the world in the late sixties and early seventies with two Presiding Officers and an entourage. But no-one seriously believed that any government would take the step to build the building until Malcolm Fraser did, very courageously I think. There are others who claim credit for it. But, if the Prime Minister gets the blame, he should get the credit. Malcolm Fraser took that step in 1978. A design competition was initiated and an estimated budget was put together. I make the point that it was an estimated budget; it was not a costed budget. When the Authority assembled, it was given 10 days by the Government of the day to put in a budget to go before the Cabinet for approval or disapproval.

         This is a unique building which was built outside the norms of construction of the time or of any other time. It is equivalent to a 50-storey building, but it rests on four storeys. I think a guesstimate is the only way in which it could be suggested that a budget was put together; it was $200m. Later in the construction phase, the Parliament House Construction Authority was also given responsibility for the furnishings and fittings of the Parliament. There were a number of alterations by the client which added to the cost of the building. I note that the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) mentioned sound and vision. He did not mention computer facilities. But the facts are that between 1978 and 1988 there were some changes in technology which had to be built into the building, otherwise the cost of building them in later would have been exorbitant.

         I want to make one or two points. Firstly, there were only two people who participated continuously throughout the whole of the process—Sir Laurence Muir and Mr Macphillamy. They were members of the Parliament House Construction Authority throughout the whole process. There were two directors of the National Capital Development Commission, one of them being Tony Powell. There were eight members of the Authority. In 1985, when I was the Minister, Mr Alex Morokoff became the Chairman and two other members were added to the Authority. They were the people who were responsible for the management of the Authority. They were experienced businessmen; they were not bureaucrats. Mr Morokoff was a senior executive of one of the biggest construction companies in Australia.

         We have this suggestion that these people were incompetent because they were the people who were responsible for the construction. They were not responsible for alterations during the project. They were not responsible for redesign or additions. When the Authority was set up, it was—as it is now known with the benefit of hindsight, one might say; I know probably as well as anyone else—deficient in that it did not have any clear and final line of direction. It was set up to make sure that all of those involved had a say. But, in fact, it resulted in none of them having a say. The Parliament House Construction Authority was responsible for the construction of the building in accordance with the design rules and in cooperation with the client, which was the Parliament.

         The Parliament was represented by the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House. The Committee had the right to direct the Authority by a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament if that became necessary. At the same time, the Executive, which was putting in the money or had to find the money during a period when there were considerable cuts going on in government revenue, had the right to direct the authority per the Minister, but that right could be disallowed by either House of the Parliament. So, if I might put it in practical terms, we had a situation where the Authority had the say; the client, the Parliament, could act on its own by passing a resolution by both Houses; the Government could act on its own by passing a resolution of both Houses; and, where the Senate and the House of Representatives, that is the Government and the Opposition, did not agree, no-one could do anything. So the actual legislative base was poor because no-one was given the final authority and, as we were in a situation where money had to be allocated in very large amounts in a couple of years, this created serious problems.

         In fact, one of the great problems that the new Parliament House had in its construction was in the last days of the Fraser Government when a Minister signed a letter which was held to be a contract for the building of the White Industries building, which would have cost the Attorney-General's Department $30m to get out of. That building was being built at exactly the same time as the new Parliament House and was drawing on the construction labour in Canberra. It is also true that the contractors of that building were paying over-award payments which were greater than those being paid on the Parliament House site and, in certain trades, creating a great deal of competition and difficulty. The Department of Industrial Relations set limits on what the Parliament House Construction Authority could pay in over-award payments, and they were the limits which were within awards and within the industry agreements. They were certainly below those which were paid on the White Industries site.

The building construction took five years. It was completed, as I said, in time to be occupied and opened on 9 May—a couple of months before we came up here for the first sittings in August 1988.

That seems to me to be a relevant comparison. This building will be here in 100 years time. As the honourable member for Forrest said in one of his positive remarks, the Australian public and every person who took part in the construction of the building are entitled to be proud of it, including the women who did the tapestries and the people who painted the paintings. I would have done differently with the art collection too, but it was not the Parliament House Construction Authority that decided how we would do the art collection; it was a committee of this Parliament that made those selections and made the recommendations. If we as a parliament chose people to do something and they did not do it as we would have liked, why do we not criticise them instead of someone else? It was our choice.

That was that the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House did not hire a consultant architect to look after its own interests.

         To put the time taken into perspective, this building eventually came out at about three times the original estimate, when we include the add-ons which were the responsibility of the Parliament and the Government of the day, and not the responsibility of the Authority. The High Court—which was built at a time when building costs were not quite so high—came in at eight times the original estimate. The National Gallery came in at five times the original estimate. Neither of those two was built within the time frame that was allocated, and neither of them was anything like the size, magnitude and complexity of this particular building.

         We can complain, and we will complain. As someone told me when I first came here, honourable members will complain about the seats, they will complain about their offices, they will complain about the dining rooms, but none of them ever resigns. The fact is that this is a magnificent building. It stands as one of the few buildings in Australia, built by Australians, of which every Australian who comes here can be proud. It is easy to score cheap political points. I think just occasionally we might show some pride in our own country and congratulate those people who were able to build a building of this nature in the circumstances that existed at the time of its construction. We should think about the miracle that it was. The construction time for this building, from the day it started to the day it finished, was one-third of the time it took to build the Qantas building, and that was built by private enterprise.

The honourable member referred to the ultimate cost of the building and, I understand, compared it with the cost of a submarine. Perhaps that comparison is a little unfortunate. We, on this side, certainly do not question the end result—the building we have here now—despite, as the honourable member for Corio said, the criticisms honourable members have of it from time to time, because they are not of any great consequence.

There are 4,500 rooms and during parliamentary sittings some 3,500 people work here. We regard very highly the facilities that are available to honourable members, such as a magnificent library and sporting facilities that are unequalled, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), who is at the table, acknowledges. These are important for honourable members, who spend, on average, 16 hours a day in this place. The gardens are not often mentioned, but I think we have fabulous gardens surrounding this place, and we do recognise that.

         As the honourable member for Forrest mentioned in his remarks, there are a few ongoing problems with this building. He mentioned that there were leaks. I presume he meant when it rains. I think the honourable member for Macarthur got an honourable mention because there were some leaks in his office at one stage. I do not know whether that is true. We are also plagued annually by bogong moths. Despite the very best efforts of the security staff, who do an excellent job, the bogong moths still manage to get in without great difficulty. But they are minor problems and we do have a wonderful result here. One of my own constituents, Mr Andrew Grechko, was Chief Construction Engineer for Roche Bros and was responsible for the majority of the civil engineering works on this site. Andrew is a close friend of mine these days and he often reminisces about the years he spent involved with this project and asks me how we are enjoying the results of his labours.

         The original cost estimate for the building was $220m, but it ended up costing over $1 billion. We were told by the Parliament House Construction Authority that that was within budget. It was, technically, because as cost blow-outs occurred, as they did from time to time, the budget was increased. So we have an element of creative accountancy, whereby, technically, it could be said that it was finished within budget—but the budget in that sense was a movable feast. A press release issued on 16 December 1985 by the honourable member for Corio said:

        In effect, there was a significant cost overrun. The honourable member for Forrest, I think quite correctly, points out that simple union abuses were responsible for this cost overrun. Most of these have come to light—ironically, as we talk about this tonight—in the recent Gyles report of the Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales, which catalogues the sorts of abuses that most of us who had our eyes open and moved around a bit were aware were going on, and certainly went on consistently, as I read the history of the construction of this place.

         Mr Gyles, QC, makes a very good case for why action should be taken against all of those who were involved in the project ultimately costing millions and perhaps billions of dollars, one way or another. Initially the BLF was involved as the major union on this project. It was subsequently deregistered and the BWIU took its place—a different name but many of the same faces. Ironically, the Building Workers Industrial Union may now face the same fate as the BLF—at least in New South Wales.

         As the honourable member for Corio correctly pointed out, there was an absolute time limit for this building. The building had to be open by the Bicentennial year, 1988, and the Queen had been asked to open it. All of that was in place, so there was an absolute time limit. All those on the project knew that they were working to that limit. This made the project and those involved in it a very easy target for the unions which were involved in this site. Over 200 contractors were involved in the building and, as I read it, many suffered severe financial hardship. Few, of course, would speak out, because of the reprisals that may well have resulted—the very reprisals that Roger Gyles now speaks about clearly in his report. So there was not a lot of criticism of union activity at the time, simply because of the fear that reprisals would result.

         There were numerous strikes. I want to refer to just one or two of them. One eight-week plumbers' strike cost one contractor $88,000, and that particular strike ended up adding $9m to the cost of the project. Looking back over newspaper reports of the earlier years, we find an amazing catalogue of union strife. In looking back over those newspaper reports I am rather concerned to find that the library files on the Parliament House construction project are missing for the years of 1986 and 1987. They have been missing for some 12 months.

         We read in the newspaper reports back in those earlier years of work being delayed, often for weeks. But ultimately, of course, the workers got what they wanted. Everybody involved knew the project had to be finished in 1988. Management and the Construction Authority in particular were aware of that deadline. Ultimately, for the unions it was very fertile ground indeed. Almost all of their demands were given into without any trouble at all. They, after all, held the ultimate trump cards.

         Take the saga of the flagpole—the magnificent flagpole that stands above this building. After the first stage of the flagpole was delivered, it sat for weeks while workers refused to put it up. What were their demands in this case? There was nothing about safety on site; they wanted houses built for themselves. Ultimately, what happened? It is not difficult to guess. The Construction Authority spent $1 1/2m building 50 houses for some of the construction workers on this site. The irony is that we are not even certain, or my research could not find out, whether the houses were ever lived in. Nevertheless, they were built. Even this arrangement to provide the houses was entered into after the Trades and Labour Council here had imposed extensive bans on new members' accommodation at the old Parliament House.

That came and went. We got rid of the BLF'. When we read the newspaper reports of the time, of course, we find that it was not nearly as easy as that at all. In fact, the whole project was seriously threatened at the time and there were significant stoppages involved. At that stage when the Government decided to deregister the BLF, the project was already 14 weeks behind schedule.

They were buried, apparently, because they had some asbestos content. The article states:

But if $200m could have been saved, surely the honourable member for Corio and the members of the Government who have not played too much of a part in this debate cannot justify the wastage of even $1, let alone $200m.

         The building is magnificent and, as I have said, a tribute to those who have worked on it. However, it stands as an indictment—not on those workers in any way at all but on their union bosses who, true to form, went for the jugular at every opportunity. Of course, we now see those very same union leaders fighting for their survival as there is a recognition these days that they are largely irrelevant.

         Like the speaker before me, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I am very proud of this building. It is a great monument to Australian democracy. It has been conceived, designed and put together with the skill of Australians. Every time we come into this place we see great things that are uniquely Australian. The technology in the building is brilliant. The future planning for technology has been well thought out, and very few mistakes have been made in that area. Natural light is able to come into every room in Parliament House except, I believe, in the ministerial wing. There must be an omen about the light not getting into the Ministry; it certainly seems that way at the moment, but I will not go down that track too far.

         Like most parliamentarians, lots of visitors from my electorate come through this building and it is something of which they feel immensely proud. I talk to them about some of the statistics of the building. When both Houses of Parliament are sitting, 3,000 people work here. Yes, it cost a bit over $1 billion. A lot has been said about that tonight. But I usually point out to my visitors that that is what we lose on the Victorian railways every year so, if those railways were run effectively in Victoria, the equivalent of a new Parliament House could be built every 12 months. We talk of money being well spent; I think the money in this building has been extraordinarily well spent.

         A lot has been said tonight about the industrial relations disaster involved in this building and certainly in the industry at the time. It is interesting to see on the walls of building sites around our capital cities a sign that says `No ticket, no start'. Some of the things that have already been mentioned are an indictment of this place. Rorts went on such that employees were paid just to turn up. There were allowances such as the multistorey allowance and the wet allowance—a special allowance which was paid when it was wet. There was a dust allowance and a dirt allowance. On other sites there was a second-hand timber allowance. I wonder whether there was a day when there was no allowance. There was a noise allowance, and even an abuse allowance on one building site in Pitt Street in Sydney where building workers were awarded an extra $45 because shoppers were abusing them.

         There are a couple of classics, one of them being the thinking allowance. The national building trades construction award and the plumbing industry award stipulated that employees required to compute or estimate quantities of materials in respect of the work performed by other employees be paid extra money for thinking. Good stuff! The dim sim allowance has already been referred to. That is quite an interesting case, once again on a Sydney building site. The workers could smell Chinese cooking in the area. This was not a complaint about the Chinese cooking; in fact, quite the reverse. It made them hungry for Chinese food and they demanded that employees receive a dim sim allowance so that they could buy some dim sims. The vanilla slice rort has already been referred to. The exotic lunch rort was a classic one where if an employer could not find within an hour and a half a lunch that was ordered by an employee they would go out on strike for the rest of the day. All these industrial problems were rife at the time.

         It is a tragedy that our system of handling industrial relations is not fair dinkum. It is not well put together and it hurts this country tremendously.

         There is one other area that I would like to talk about. All of my visitors who come through here on a regular basis are terribly proud of this building except for one point. It is amazing that it comes out time and time again. They all comment on the art collection. The art collection comprises about 3,000 acquired and some 70 commissioned works. It was decided somewhere around 1981 that we would have an art advisory committee. The Parliament House Construction Authority agreed in principle to establish a committee to advise it on the selection and placement of artworks and the commissioning of artists. Some of that artwork is obviously magnificent, has great acclaim and is recognised by people who come through here. But, while the majority of it that is hanging around the building may be perceived by experts as being a great collection, let me tell those experts that the general public do not hold some of these works in that esteem.

         There is a story that goes around that is rather interesting, which is that when the art—some of the sculptures and bits and pieces—were being put in place some of the workers from the construction site went down to their workshop, belted a few pieces together with the welder, spray painted them, ran over them with the car, then dragged them up here and put them in place. Rumour has it that it took several months to find out which were the purchased pieces and which were the ones knocked up in a few minutes in the workshop. If that story is true—there are a couple of people nodding, indicating that there is an element of truth in it—it is an indictment of the standard of art work in this place.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          If this collection were in a commercial gallery, the gallery would go broke. That is a pity. I would like to see some balance brought into this place so that when average Australians come through they can see work that is of a collector's nature, that is put together by experts, but which also reflects their values. At the moment that does not appear to be happening; it appears that we are driven by an intellectual snobbery of the art world which, quite frankly, is disappointing. It is the one disappointing feature for those people who come here.

         —The House is resuming the debate on the ministerial statement on the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We have heard the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), addressing this extraordinary report, which took a great deal of time to develop and involves nearly 400 recommendations. It deals with the grim reality of some 100 deaths of Aboriginal people in custody.

         It is perhaps important to note that the inquiry found that the disproportionate number of Aboriginal deaths in custody flows not so much from a disproportionate percentage of Aboriginals dying in custody as from a disproportionate number of Aboriginal people being in custody. If that seems rather confusing, let me put it another way. There are, according to the report, 29 times more Aboriginal people in custody than anyone else in the rest of the community. A significant number of people die in custody, and the significant number of Aboriginal people is a function of that very large number who are imprisoned.

         I want to acknowledge that in this debate many of the things which I think need to be said have already been said by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm. He points out a series of things which I think are fundamentally important. He deals with the statistical point that I made, but he also raised three points. He said that his first concern is that government alone will never solve the challenge facing Aboriginal Australians. He says that that point is acknowledged by the Royal Commission.

         He said that the second prerequisite is assistance from the broad society, and this basically means assistance from government with the support of the electorate or at least without its opposition, and that, according to the Commissioner, the third prerequisite is having in place an established method and procedure whereby the broader society can supply the assistance. He went on to say a little later in his speech:

       <para>
        With great respect, I agree with all of that. I commend the shadow Minister in his pursuit of sensible and good policies in this area which will produce outcomes, or outputs, as I think his expression is—results—which are far better than we have achieved in the past.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think it is very important in any dialogue between non-Aboriginal Australians and Aboriginal Australians that, if possible, we establish the reality that, on the part of non-Aboriginal Australians, there has been a considerable effort since the referendum of 1967—the twenty-fifth anniversary of which we celebrated just a few days ago—particularly at government level, to get away from the prejudice of the past and to have positive programs which will enable Aboriginal people to have a proper place in Australian society, a dignified and respected place in Australian society.

         I think that, unless on the Aboriginal side there is an understanding that there is a great fund of goodwill, a desire for their advancement and for them to have their proper place in the sun, we are unlikely to make much progress. But I also acknowledge what is recorded in the Royal Commission and dealt with in the speeches already made in this place by both the Minister and the shadow Minister, that there is continuing prejudice and ill-treatment on a continuous and daily basis for many people, which is itself an enormous barrier to their ever having a dignified and proper place in society and a reasonable and happy life.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The reason I wanted to speak on this matter at all is that I think there are some fundamental dilemmas in this matter which need to be acknowledged and addressed if we are to do better in the future than we have in the past. Recently, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs reported on the issues of self-management and self-determination. The report was full of the sorts of sentiments which many of us have been expressing now for nearly a generation. I say that without disrespect, but the desire which is expressed in this Royal Commission, and in so many documents, that Aboriginal people should determine their own place in Australia, and that there should be a right to an independently determined place within Australian society, is almost a truism.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It seems to me that, in acknowledging the right and freedom  of Aboriginal Australians which ought to exist in Australia, and which mirrors the right of other Australians, to determine what sorts of lives they will lead, what lifestyles they will follow and to have control over their own lives, it is possible to overlook that the exercise of that freedom itself can be a continuing part of the difficulty and a continuing reason why we have report after report, Minister after Minister, program after program, and a lack of the results that we all seek.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I can only be very brief in this speech, but in this report we find an acknowledgment of the poor standard of care shown towards people in custody and of the little appreciation by prison officers and police of the duty of care owed to those in their custody. That is probably a part of the truth. One would also have to acknowledge that in many parts of Australia the only people who are expected to be available to deal with difficult social and other circumstances are the police. Their excessive involvement in dealing with the lives of Aboriginal people, and often taking them into custody under circumstances where that is ultimately a very destructive thing to do, is something which is forced upon them by the neglect of the rest of us. I think it is important to acknowledge that, just as it is important to acknowledge what the Royal Commission said, namely:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The challenge for police departments is to accept there is a basis for Aboriginal resentment and suspicion about police conduct and to consider the Aboriginal perspective when devising policing strategies.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the issue I want to focus on really can be dealt with by looking at the sections of this report which relate to empowerment, to young people and to education. The Royal Commission said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no other way. Only the Aboriginal people can, in the final analysis, assure their own future.
       </para>
       <para>
        That quotation from the report is again something that I accept. Governments around Australia generally seem to be happy to pick up these notions of empowerment and self-determination as something which must be part of policy making and program development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think that that is true, but my concern about this notion is that, if people make a determination about their own lives and their own future, and that determination involves adopting a lifestyle which in a sense takes the family of the individual concerned outside the mainstream of Australian life, and if, in particular, it takes the dependants of that person outside the educational system, we have a fundamental conflict between the individual's right to determine his own future or her own future and the right of his or her child to determine his or her own future.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not think that that point is sufficiently acknowledged by policy makers or, indeed, by this Royal Commission—or indeed by any of us. I think that when it is said that only the Aboriginal people can, in the final analysis, assure their own future, the simple reality is that unless the choices of Aboriginal people are choices which pass on a real capacity to make their own decisions and to have the skills which are required to work and to live in Australian society, we are simply caught up in an endless, vicious circle. That might seem a bit of a truism, and it might even seem very trite, but, unfortunately, in many areas that is the position we are in.

         Again, I do not wish to overstate that. There are, as the shadow Minister observed and others have observed, many examples of success. The other night in Parliament House, as we celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum, one Aboriginal person said to me, `This is a real
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Who's Who
         </emphasis>
         of Aboriginal Australia here tonight'. We were surrounded by the most splendid, high achieving, wonderful people. But I am sure they would all agree that there are many Aboriginal people who are not in that happy position and who do seem to be caught in this endless and repetitive circle of failure which leads to the sorts of deaths and horror which are reported on by this Royal Commission.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The issue of attitudes is fundamental. That is why I support the whole notion of reconciliation. It is dealt with in the report which refers to the fact that relationships with non-Aboriginal people are often characterised by distrust, enmity and disputation. I must say that, in my view, one of the simplest and wisest things I have heard on this issue was said by a Catholic priest from Bathurst. He was reported to have said that if non-Aboriginal Australians really wish to make a difference, it might be that each could choose to make friends with one or two Aboriginal people. That is part of the reality that non-Aboriginal communities should face. We should accept that challenge.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When we look at the recommendations relating to young people, we see the force of this problem that can only be solved by the Aboriginal people themselves and can only be solved if they are given adequate assistance by the community and by public authorities. The Royal Commission said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the problems affecting Aboriginal juveniles are so widespread and have such potentially disastrous repercussions for the future that there is an urgent need for governments and Aboriginal organisations to negotiate together to devise strategies designed to reduce the rate at which Aboriginal juveniles are involved in the welfare and criminal justice systems and, in particular, to reduce the rate at which Aboriginal juveniles are separated from their families and communities . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I will stand with anyone in this House in support of resources being available for the community to meet its responsibilities. I think it is also vital that we hear from people in the Aboriginal community that they can see that the problems affecting Aboriginal juveniles are essentially problems which only they can deal with. There is no stronger view in the Aboriginal community than that the greatest injustice that we have done over recent generations was the wholesale removal of Aboriginal children from their parents. The shadow Minister referred to that in his speech.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is a fact that the first legal case I did for an Aboriginal involved an attempt by the welfare authorities to remove six children from a caring and good mother. The case was easily defeated. The shocking thing is that I was told after that case was defeated that it was the first time that the Department had known such a case to be defended. I am deeply offended, as I know other honourable members of this House are, by the notion that within our recent lifetime this sort of family disruption was condoned as an act of public policy.

         Now that we have moved into more humane and decent times, in that respect at least, I say that it is a useless reform if Aboriginal parents do not undertake the often difficult task of disciplining their children, requiring them to attend school, and ensuring that they achieve the skills which are necessary for them to have a genuine choice about their future as they grow up. It is unfashionable and certainly open to abuse for a middle-class white of good income to make that sort of comment to an Aboriginal group. In my early years the only person who was prepared to do it was Dr Henry Schapper of the University of Western Australia.

         The need for mutuality in the processes that have to be adopted is something that is so obvious that we must put stress upon it. There needs to be goodwill, and indeed affection, from the non-Aboriginal community to the Aboriginal community. There needs to be acceptance of the views that Charles Perkins is putting these days: the solutions are presented by the person who looks back at himself when he looks into the mirror in the morning as he washes his face. Until there is a coming together, in a genuine sense, in the view that both sides have to contribute and that there is a heavy responsibility on both sides, we will continue down the relatively unsuccessful path of the last generation.

         —I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate in relation to the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. At the outset I commend the work of the Commission, the commissioners and all those involved in this work. I refer to Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, Commissioner Pat Dodson, Commissioner the honourable D.J. O'Dea, Commissioner the honourable J.H. Wootten and Commissioner L.F. Wyvill.

         They were ably assisted by Mr Geoff Eames, QC, who I notice has recently been appointed as a judge to the Supreme Court of Victoria and Mr John Gavin, Secretary to the Commission, as well as the many people who were involved in the research, including my good friend Marcia Langton. I had the fortune to work directly with two people involved in this report in my previous employment before entering this Parliament: Patrick Dodson, who was a commissioner and my boss in a previous working life; and Marcia Langton who was a coworker at the Central Land Council when I was employed there.

         This report gives us the opportunity to recall the dimension of the human suffering and tragedy that led to the Royal Commission's being set up in the first instance. We also need to remember that this report deals with contemporary Australia. It is not an analysis of 50 years ago; it is not an analysis of 30 years ago, except in so far as it addresses some of the underlying issues, including that mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), of young children being taken away from parents.

         Whilst it is about contemporary Australia, it concerns itself with issues which have their roots in abhorrent and aberrant policies of the past, including that to which I just referred. By and large the policies were—in some cases in some areas of Australia they are still—founded on presumptions of dispossession and the alienation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In my view this report, quite justifiably, brings to the fore the just demands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have their fundamental rights to justice and fair treatment recognised and addressed. In many respects, it underlines the quest by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to take control of their own lives, to manage their own affairs, and for us to recognise and address this call for self-determination. I just refer to a couple of sections of the Commission's report. Firstly, I refer to paragraph 1.7.33, in which Commissioner Johnston says:

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the ultimate, self-determination is basically about people having the right to make decisions concerning their own lives, their own communities, the right to retain their culture and to develop it.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, I refer to section l.7.34, in which the Commissioner says:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I summarise by saying that the whole thrust of this report is directed towards the empowerment of Aboriginal society on the basis of their deeply held desire, their demonstrated capacity, their democratic right to exercise, according to circumstances, maximum control over their own lives and that of their communities; that such empowerment requires that the broader society, on the one hand, makes material assistance available to make good past deprivations and on the other hand approaches relationships with Aboriginal society on the basis of the principles of self-determination.

       </para>
       <para>
        I want to talk about this for just a moment, because in my view, the nub of the report is, in a sense, the need for us to recognise the fundamental rights of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There must be recognition that non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have imposed a view and perpetrated myths about what Aboriginal people want and what policies, administrative practices and procedures best suit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; in other words, non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have known what is best for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         I have been fortunate to have lived and worked with Aboriginal people over a number of years. It concerns me that, whilst we are having a very important debate about these principles, whilst they are purported to have bipartisan support—at least in this Parliament—and whilst it can be argued, I think justifiably, that this Government has moved in many respects to redress some of the discrimination and inequality of the past, there is nevertheless a justifiable concern that indeed what the Aboriginal community regards as self-determination and self-management is not necessarily what has been reflected by government policy. As I have said, this Government has done more than any other government to address that issue. One has only to look at the development of ATSIC as a very good example of that.

         Unfortunately, the same attitude is not reflected in State and Territory governments. Whilst we in this Parliament can make what I think, in terms of the good faith of both sides of this House, are statements which express very strongly held views, we have difficulty in ensuring that those views manifest themselves in policy. To a large extent, that is happening in this place. At least to my way of thinking, it has not been demonstrated that what we believe as a result of the report by Elliott Johnston and as a result of the numerous reports which have been handed down in this Parliament by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which has addressed these very issues, is being given expression by State and Territory governments in the way in which they deal with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         I am sure that, as is their wont, they will say that in fact they recognise these rights and that they laud the principles which are contained in these documents. But, in my view, they have yet to demonstrate that they understand fully what has been required of them by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I think that as a community, whilst we will accept this report and whilst we will say that it meets the requirements as we would perceive them in terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, we have to say that there is a great deal of difference between the mythology, if you like, of what people think they support in terms of what has been asked for in this Royal Commission report and what in fact they do support. It is given expression in terms of the policies which they enact and administrative procedures and practices they put in place.

         I want to refer again to the report by Commissioner Johnston and this issue of self-determination. A couple of paragraphs cause me concern, only to the extent that they were not common knowledge. The realisations which are inherent in what Commissioner Johnston has said have not been readily understood by the set of administrative processes which have governed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country since 1788. Paragraph 1.7.21 states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They were here, they had their culture, they did not leave and did not ask others to come. They did not go through the process of leaving the old to embrace the new. They never voluntarily surrendered their culture, and, indeed, fought tooth and nail to preserve it, throughout dispossession, protection, assimilation, integration. In their own words, they survived and their culture survived: in different forms and to different degrees in different parts of the country as a result of different experiences. They have the right to retain that culture, and that identity. Self-determination is both the expression and the guarantee of that right.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph 1.7.23—and I apologise for the length of this excerpt, but I think it is very important because it puts this matter in context—states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Non-Aboriginal Australia must face the fact that for a very long time we have proceeded on the basis that Aboriginal people were inferior, were unable to make decisions affecting themselves, that we knew what was best for them, that we had to make decisions affecting them; it became second nature for us to have that attitude.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have to say, sadly, that many people in our community and in spheres of government—not in this place—still hold those views. In a moment I will address this vexed question of institutionalised discrimination which, in my view, is still apparent in some sections of the Commonwealth bureaucracy and certainly at various levels of State government. I will come to a specific example. I want to finish off this quotation from Commissioner Johnston, which gave expression to what I had been thinking for many years. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, that quote says a great deal. Elliott Johnston, an eminent QC, is a person whom one would have thought may have at least had cause to come to terms with some of these realities prior to this Royal Commission. He is well read, someone who one would argue is an intellectual. Yet it took this Commission's report written by someone who is probably a liberal—in the proper sense of the word—to come to terms with the very reality of what Aboriginal people have been subjected to since this country was first occupied and invaded in 1788.

         I said I wanted to talk about institutionalised racism. I want to refer to one particular event. Last year an episode—a very sad episode—confronted people in Alice Springs concerning Traeger Park Primary School. It had established itself as a school that catered for Aboriginal children. The program developed by a dedicated band of teachers had become well known in educational circles, both nationally and internationally. Many Aboriginal adults who have successfully studied at secondary school level attribute the gaining of a start in life to the socially supportive conditions and culturally appropriate programs at Traeger Park School.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Against this background, the Northern Territory Government announced that this school would be closed as a cost cutting measure. The parents of the Traeger Park students pursued a number of avenues to have this decision reversed. Eventually, they turned to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commission found that the decision of the Northern Territory Government Minister for Education to close the Traeger Park Primary School in Alice Springs was an act based on race. Need I say more?

         That is a matter of great concern to me. I think a number of institutions within this country need to take stock of themselves and the role they play in public life. I have spoken about institutionalised racism. It is exhibited not only in terms of the public sector, but also in terms of the media. Although I do not have the time to address it here in this debate, at some stage I would like to take the time of this House to talk about the role of the media in ensuring that institutionalised racism—or at least a very biased ethnocentric view of race in Australia—is forced upon the Australian community.

          Aboriginal Deaths in Custody: Overview of the Response by Governments to the Royal Commission.

         The foreword is signed by the Federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and every one of the State Ministers. It states:

         The central fact for the Royal Commission—and for our Governments in responding to it—is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are grossly over-represented in custody and that this is the cause of the totally unacceptable number of deaths.

         We therefore fully accept the Royal Commission's insistence that the problem be tackled simultaneously at two levels—an improvement to the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to the criminal justice system, and a strengthened commitment to correct the fundamental factors which bring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into contact with the system.

         I think it is difficult for non-Aboriginal people to appreciate the links between what has happened to Aboriginal people over the last 200 years, the refuge sought in alcohol over-use and the other factors leading to the high custody rates for Aboriginal people. That foreword about Aboriginal deaths in custody was a commitment from the Federal and State Ministers. It was a pledge of their effort to do something about the situation. They gave a commitment to address the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But they gave that commitment in 1992. One is tempted to ask whatever happened in the 25 years since that famous 1967 referendum, marked with such prominence only last week?

         I remind the House that on 27 May 1967 Australians in the six States voted in two constitutional referenda. The second, of course, was the Aboriginal referendum. As we always hear, a massive 90.77 per cent Yes vote was recorded on that occasion. Of course, that is still the highest for any constitutional referendum in this country.

         The accepted view of that referendum has been, I have to say, remarkably consistent. We have heard about the overwhelming vote of support for granting powers to the Commonwealth in this area. To Nugget Coombs it revealed an `astonishing unanimity' in the electorate over the need to give the Commonwealth this power. The headlines screamed out, `National Expression of Goodwill'. We are told that it showed that voters accepted the need for greater efforts in Aboriginal welfare.

         Of course, a vote as large as that had an air of inevitability about it. What opposition there was appeared insignificant and of no importance. So, why should the lot of the Aboriginal community not have improved dramatically? However, I remind honourable members that 9.23 per cent of people voted no. That actually represented 517,000 people. I ask myself why over half a million voters opposed the referendum. Was it meant to be an anti-Canberra vote? Was it about States' rights? The truth of the matter is that examination of the vote shows that there was considerable variation of the No vote based on what can only be described as proximity to Aboriginal people.

         The highest numbers of No votes occurred in the three States which had the largest proportion of Aboriginals in their populations. In some States where Aboriginals were less in evidence to most of the population, the Aboriginal problem, so-called at the time, was more a matter of objective ideals and less a matter of the day to day reality of having to deal  with people as part of the local community.

         I did a little research. It turns out, for example, that in the four electorates of Chisholm, Bruce, Deakin and La Trobe, a group of four seats in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, there was a less than 4 per cent No vote. It is interesting that, quite coincidentally, my electorate of Aston has since been carved out of those four seats. However, in the electorates of Moore, Perth and Canning in Western Australia, and Kennedy in Queensland, there was a No vote of over 20 per cent. In the electorate of Kalgoorlie, there was a 29 per cent No vote. I am not having a go, specifically, but I am drawing logical conclusions as to what happened, because I think there will be a consequent reason why we need to be aware of that.

         In the years since 1967, commentators have invariably spoken of what Australians decided in the referendum. But perhaps we need to be that little bit more careful in our assessments than has hitherto been the case. Surely what occurred in 1967 was that, while rural Australians were far from overwhelming in their support, urban eastern Australians decided in unprecedented numbers to make those changes to the Constitution.

         Why then in the last 25 years has there not been the degree of progress for Aboriginal people that many would have wished? Is it to do with the fact that the decision makers in the areas of heaviest Aboriginal population were not that committed? I suspect that that is the case. I suspect that that is why, in fact, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community has not made the progress it should have. We still have lower life expectancy rates amongst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. Relatively, compared with the broad population, they have poor health, education and housing. They have very high levels of unemployment.

We heard that in some parts of the western suburbs of Sydney the Aboriginal community has an unemployment rate in excess of 80 per cent—even in good times. That is appalling. Substance abuse in the community is very visible. There is an over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prisons.

         Aboriginal land rights are just not supported. There is little understanding of the cultural and spiritual significance of land to the Aboriginal community. There is a consensus that too many ill-directed benefits have taken away a sense of self-responsibility amongst those in the Aboriginal community. The Government's role is perceived all too often as making Aboriginal people a privileged group which, paradoxically, harms them by taking away their self-responsibility. The Aboriginal situation is perceived to be a difficult one to improve. A necessary requirement for this to occur is for Aboriginal people to become more self-responsible and self-sufficient by reducing Government handouts and by forgetting about the past and having a more positive attitude towards non-Aboriginals.

         I remind the House of the preamble to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991 which outlines the principles behind the reconciliation process: Australia was occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had settled for thousands of years before British settlement; many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffered dispossession and dispersal from their traditional lands by the British Crown; to date there has been no formal process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians; and by the year 2001, the centenary of Federation, it is most desirable that there be such a reconciliation. This Act was passed unanimously by this Parliament less than 12 months ago. The Council has already started work. Its strategy plan is due for tabling in this place shortly. Without duplicating the work of other bodies, it has a responsibility to try to heal the wounds of the total Australian community that have festered now for nearly 200 years.

         The way to do this, I suggest, is to bring indigenous and other Australians together in mutual respect, so that we can gain a greater understanding of the importance of land and sea in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander society; develop better relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the wider community; achieve recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a valued part of our total heritage; and cultivate a sense for all Australians of a shared ownership of our history. We should demonstrate a greater awareness of the causes of disadvantage that prevent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from achieving fair and proper standards in health, housing, employment and education. We should encourage a greater community response to addressing those underlying causes that currently give rise to the unacceptably high levels of custody for the Aboriginal community.

I believe that, now that we have embarked on this course, we have a unique opportunity to deal with something we have failed to come to grips with properly in the last 200 years. I remind the House that there is a responsibility for all of us to join in helping to change the attitude so necessary to effect meaningful improvement for our indigenous people. Not to do so will simply be unacceptable to our successors and to the rest of the world.

But until I examined the files of the people who died and the other material that has come before the Commission and listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis".

         Over half of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are under the age of 20 years. Young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are overrepresented in institutions and other youth detention centres at rates 29 times that of non-Aboriginal youth. In some areas of high Aboriginal population, such as north-west New South Wales, the figure is as high as 90 times.

         The Royal Commission found that 74 of the 99 people whose deaths it had investigated had come into contact with the criminal justice system at or before the age of 19 years. It found also that a person taken into custody as a juvenile was far more likely to re-offend. Young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are often denied the opportunity to receive bail and are detained in custody because they have no appropriate fixed address or means of meeting other conditions of bail. Young people who are detained, rather than granted bail, are more likely to receive custodial sentences.

         The Government in its response announced funding for the provision of supervised youth bail hostels in each State and Territory major centre.

         Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations will be invited to operate the hostels with the involvement of parents, elders and other community members where possible in the programs. It is absolutely crucial that we keep these young people out of the custodial detention system. They are massively overrepresented now, and the very essence of the Commissioner's report and the Government's response is to massively reduce this situation. Aboriginal social and economic disadvantage is the underlying cause of the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in detention and, consequently, of deaths in custody.

         Over the period covered by the Royal Commission, if non-Aboriginal Australians had been imprisoned at the same rate as Aboriginals and then died in custody at the same rate, over 8,500 Australians would have died. This gives some idea of the enormity of the tragedy of wasted Aboriginal lives. It is also worth repeating that, if the rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal people can be reduced to match the rate of non-Aboriginal imprisonment, over $80m a year will be saved in costs to the prison system. That is $80m a year more that we can and should spend to address the fundamental issues of disadvantage affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         Of the 99 people whose deaths were examined by the Royal Commission, all had histories of heavy use of alcohol or other illicit drugs. Forty-three people had last been taken into custody on alcohol related charges and most were in very poor health. Forty-three people had been charged with offences at or before the age of 15, and 74 had been charged at or before the age of 19. Alcohol abuse is the major health and social problem experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is a prime factor in health problems, domestic violence, family breakdown, lawlessness and incarceration. It is clear, from the evidence that I have seen all around Australia on my visits to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as part of my work with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, that local community based and devised programs have the greatest prospect of success in tackling the harm caused through alcohol and substance abuse.

        , which has been broadcast on various radio stations in Perth since the mid-1980s (but predominantly Radio 6PR), has attracted more criticism than any other program in recent times. Anyone connected with Aboriginal affairs in WA will be aware of the degree of anger and loathing for this program and its host from Aboriginal people themselves. This feeling is shared by their supporters and sympathisers, and by many others in the community who are simply `turned off' by racist prejudice. Since 1989 Sattler has been the subject of 19 individual complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for comments by himself or callers to his program relating to Aboriginal people and culture. These account for over half of the total of 34 complaints from Western Australia about racial or ethnic discrimination on electronic media received by the ABT between 1989 and 1992.

         Distaste for Sattler's brand of broadcasting is, however, not limited to those who are specifically sensitive to the way Aboriginal issues are treated. A market research study commissioned by 6PR itself in 1990 found that a sample study group believed Sattler was `arrogant, rude, dogmatic' and that he `deliberately sensationalised issues'. He was seen to express `predetermined views', on many issues, about which he was also `not well-informed'. His manner of delivering his comments to callers with whom he disagreed was likened to `a slap in the face'.

         A consistent theme running through Sattler's treatment of Aboriginal issues, and one which he frequently verbalises, is that `all Australians should be treated equally'. The inference in this otherwise egalitarian principle is that Aboriginal people should not be entitled to special government assistance programs, because this is `unequal treatment'. This theft of democratic rhetoric callously exploits a genuine sense of fairness within broad sections of the white community, but does nothing to cure the same community's historic blindness to the realities of colonialism, thence to extend the hand of equality towards Aboriginal people.

         As a nation, we have tried discussion, suppression, segregation, isolation and assimilation—all without achieving any worthwhile objective. Most of these policies were implemented with the very best of intentions, but it has to be said that there are many aspects of the lives of Aboriginal people which are less than what should be acceptable in a caring and responsible society. There is no simple solution to the problems involved, and government policy, both State and Federal, seems to be inconsistent and directionless. Debate is usually built around pious empty cliches and is motivated by a desire to appease the consciences of urban Australians, most of whom have never had any personal dealings with real Aboriginals.

         The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was commissioned in an atmosphere of community outrage at the 99 Aboriginals who had died in custody between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989. The response of governments to the Royal Commission is built entirely around an extra commitment of money. We are told that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) asked for $500m, but eventually had to settle for $150m over five years. The government decision had nothing to do with the relevant merits of programs being proposed and the likelihood of their success, but whether the Commonwealth or States should pay and how much money should be allocated.

Unfortunately, much policy making is based on emotionalism, lack of knowledge of the facts and sometimes deliberate distortions of history. Governments pour billions of dollars into Aboriginal programs, but anyone who dares to draw attention to the appropriateness of this expenditure or to the corruption, misappropriation, nepotism and lack of accountability of this expenditure is immediately branded as a racist. We cannot have an intelligent debate leading to better solutions when anyone who asks justifiable questions is immediately abused and condemned.

         Consequently, over time completely erroneous views eventually acquire the status of fact, and policies based on such unsound foundations are certain to fail. It is nonsense, for instance, to suggest that the problems of the Australian Aboriginal people began with the arrival of whites. The truth is that, historically, Australian Aboriginals endured among the lowest standards of living of the indigenous peoples of the world. They endured mass starvation, exposure, tribal battles, barbaric abuse and a very short life expectancy. It is true that Europeans brought with them many of their social evils, which quickly spread to Aboriginals, including new diseases and, worst of all, alcohol. But in spite of all this—or what some radicals may say—European settlement has also brought advances for Aboriginals.

         There is also widespread community concern about who we define these days as being Aboriginal. The idea that someone who may be only one-sixteenth Aboriginal can claim aboriginality on the basis of that one-sixteenth defies credibility. If he is only one-sixteenth Aboriginal, it follows that he is fifteen-sixteenths something else. Why should that one-sixteenth grant a right to claim Abstudy or some other Aboriginal benefit which the other fifteen-sixteenths are not entitled to? How can someone who is more Irish or Filipino than Aboriginal claim a special affinity with the land not shown by other Australians which would entitle him to claim land legally owned by and cared for by some other Australians?

         Claims by blue-eyed blonds and redheads allegedly made on behalf of their `fellow' Aboriginals have done much to destroy the credibility of the Aboriginal cause. Yet it is very often these sorts of people with their capital city white advisers who are foremost in making land claims and other demands on behalf of Aboriginals. They can be three or four generations away from anyone who had any real association with the land that they now claim. It never occurred to their Aboriginal forefathers to claim the land as a sacred site. It is remarkable how many land claims have suddenly appeared following massive increases in government funding to non-Aboriginal advisers. Some of the claims being made should be treated with scepticism, particularly as traditional Aboriginals would never reveal the locality of their sacred sites to outsiders, nor share their legends with people of less than full blood. It is widely argued that Ayers Rock was given to the wrong tribe—the group which led the loudest white advisers.

         The Minister has just banned the construction of a dam on the Todd River near Alice Springs, a project that would have brought great benefits to the black and white people of the region, because of alleged sacred sites in the region. There were no sacred sites mentioned in that area in 1966 when the dam proposals were first under consideration, and eventually rejected on engineering grounds. Sadly, sometimes people with completely different agendas, such as radical conservationists, the anti-mining and anti-development lobbies, have abused the processes of Aboriginal land claims for their own means.

         On Fraser Island in my own electorate, land rights claims have been firmly rebutted as recently as last year by no less a person than the senior elder of the original inhabitants of the Hervey Bay area, the Budjilla people, Mrs Olga Miller, when she said that Fraser Island had no cultural significance for the Aboriginal people. She said:

        That did not stop Tony Fitzgerald in his commission of inquiry into the region from recommending that programs be implemented to seek out Aboriginal people who might have some affiliation with the region, and to place those areas under their control. It is amazing just how many new groups have arrived on the scene since that recommendation, making claims on the Island with demands for millions of dollars to be given to them for their projects. People flew in from thousands of miles away when it was time to choose an Aboriginal representative on the Fraser Island Advisory Committee.

         The sad thing is that all of the granting of Aboriginal land claims has done nothing to improve the lot of the benefited people. There is just as much social degradation, financial despair and aimlessness after land has been given to Aboriginals as they endured before. It has not made any difference whether the land is a reserve, leasehold, deed of grant in trust or this remarkable thing called inalienable freehold—not that there can be such a thing as inalienable freehold, the two words are mutually exclusive. If it is freehold, it cannot be inalienable; if it is inalienable, it cannot be freehold. Secure title has not guaranteed prosperity or an improved lifestyle for Aboriginals. The fact that Northern Territory Aboriginals have control over such vast tracts of land in that part of Australia has not made them any happier.

         For its $30m cost, the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Royal Commission has made some small advancements in uncovering the facts. For instance, it has been established that the deaths of Aboriginals in custody were not the result of specific racism, abuse or neglect by gaol or prison keepers. Nor are the deaths particularly as a result of the `copycat' syndrome—some special Aboriginal abhorrence of being imprisoned—or any other racially related factor. The startling statistic and reality arising from the inquiry was that proportionally just as many white people die in custody as blacks. The fundamental problem is that Aborigines are 29 times more likely to be in gaol than whites. That is the really alarming statistic—the one that disturbs all people interested in Aboriginal welfare, and which must be addressed in the context of this Royal Commission.

         When we look at the profile of those 99 Aboriginal people who died, we see that 88 were men, 83 were unemployed, 43 had been separated from their natural families, only two had completed secondary schooling and 43 had been charged with an offence before the age of 15. I suspect that those figures, alarming as they are, differ not all that much from a profile of the non-Aboriginal prison population.

         There is one additional statistic which graphically demonstrates the direct cause of there being so many Aborigines in custody: 43 of those who died were taken into custody on matters directly related to the overuse of alcohol and most had a history of alcohol or drug abuse. The introduction of alcohol to the Aboriginal community has been perhaps the greatest scourge on their lifestyle. The deaths in custody is only one aspect of the hurt and destruction that alcohol has brought to Aborigines.

         So much of the vandalism, violence and disorder associated with Aborigines has an alcohol link. Aboriginal community leaders know this and some are even trying to ban alcohol from their communities. We should not be afraid to support and encourage leaders who take that decision. Unfortunately, such a move sometimes leads to bootlegging, smuggling, rank profiteering and a new range of criminal activities. It would be better if Aboriginals were to learn to live with alcohol and to use it sparingly for social purposes. After all, they may not be able to spend their whole lives in an alcohol free environment.

         Cherbourg, in my electorate, seeks to control alcohol abuses by carefully managing its own canteen, with some success. Nonetheless, I can understand those communities which choose to shut themselves away from alcohol and the effects on their families. It is now being suggested that we should stop gaoling Aborigines, even temporarily, for alcohol related offences. Recently I was contacted by people in my electorate following a drunken rampage by a gang of about 30 youths, who went on an orgy of destruction and violence through the town of Murgon, assaulting a number of people, including a 50-year-old intellectually handicapped man and later an 84-year-old woman in her own bedroom.

But what about the safety of ordinary Australians? If we merely detain and shelter those under the influence of alcohol and then release them, nothing will be done to treat their problems and they will soon be back, in more serious trouble.

         Alcoholism itself is only a symptom of the fundamental cause of Aboriginal despair. People turn to alcohol largely because of idleness and a lack of challenges.

         I believe that in developing Aboriginal affairs policy we should be aiming to emphasise what all Australians have in common rather than highlighting their ethnic differences. All Australians, whether they be British or Aboriginal in background, have something to contribute towards our society. The traditional Aboriginal culture has been badly damaged. There are so many missing generations that the ancient stories have become distorted. Even if it were desirable, we cannot go back to the days of Captain Cook. The world has changed and the hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal people for their future have also changed. They have been influenced by the technological age, television and the consumer society, much like those people with European backgrounds. Most Aboriginals want for their families things similar to those that other Australians want: a secure future, a good job and an opportunity to contribute to a better community.

         Most Aborigines are proud of their history, and so are whites. When asked recently to identify what Aboriginals in the Cherbourg community wanted, a councillor from the Cherbourg Council said that they wanted a greater incentive and better employment opportunities. That is exactly the same priority that any white community is likely to have for its future. We need to develop an understanding of Aboriginal and white culture, work towards the advancement of Aboriginal Australians and provide them with the opportunities and incentives to build a better future for themselves. This means cooperation, not necessarily hand-outs; assistance, not necessarily direction; and encouragement for worthwhile achievements rather than condemnation for any failures which may occur.

         I was not going to mention the matter at this stage, but as I am following the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), I am left with no choice but to respond to him and some of the criticisms that he made. For 32 years, Queensland had a government that was not very responsive to the Aboriginal people. I think the honourable member for the Northern Territory earlier mentioned institutional racism. It has been institutionalised for a long time in much of our society and people in our society have been brought up with that thinking.

Rather than try to address the individual points he makes, I would ask that he have a good look at some of the things he said here tonight and at what he said in his speech on the reconciliation committee. He does not reflect the attitude that Australia should be taking in 1992 in dealing with the issues that concern Aboriginal people. I think it is a great thing that the majority of people in this House do not reflect his view. I will not dwell too much longer on that.

         Twenty-five years ago, Australians showed that they are prepared to acknowledge injustice when they are confronted by it. It was a demonstration of the fundamental tolerance of Australians that this referendum was passed with 91 per cent support, a margin unprecedented in the history of constitutional reform in this country. The passing of that referendum marked the opening of a new era in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, as it gave the Federal Government the power to establish both the Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

         In the past 25 years there have been many real achievements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The rate of infant mortality amongst Aborigines has declined, falling from around 10 per cent in the Northern Territory 25 years ago to around 3 per cent today. While honourable members will agree that this figure is far too high, it is a substantial improvement. There has also been an increase in Aboriginal participation in the education system. Twenty years ago there were only 72 Aborigines in tertiary education institutions throughout Australia, while today there are nearly 4,000. Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders now have a greater say in the running of their own communities through the framework of ATSIC. So there has been substantial progress towards addressing the historical injustices that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have suffered. Unfortunately, there is still much to be done.

         These feelings were only too sadly confirmed by the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Commission was set up to investigate the deaths of 99 Aboriginal people in custody between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989. The lives of the 88 men and 11 women were a reflection of their people's position in Australian society, with 83 being unemployed at the time of their death, 43 being separated from their natural parents during childhood following the intervention of State welfare bodies and missions, and only two finishing their secondary education. Forty-three were in trouble with the law before their fifteenth birthday, and nearly half of those who died in custody were imprisoned for alcohol and related offences. The fact that the average age of those who died of natural causes was only just over 30 years is an appalling commentary on the average health levels of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         The lives of the 99 people who died in custody during the nine-year period under investigation are sadly all too typical of life in the communities from which they come. Today Australians are confronted with the terrible fact that the rate of imprisonment amongst Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders is 29 times that of the rest of the Australian community, which other members have indicated here tonight. I am sure this statistic disturbs every member of this House, because if non-Aborigines were imprisoned at the same rate and had died in custody, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) reminded us earlier, over 8,500 Australians would have died. The fundamental cause of this intolerable situation is the disadvantaged position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Australian society.

         —During the mid-nineteenth century, an ancestor and namesake of mine, Captain Charles Tuckey, rescued two white Yugoslavs from North West Cape of Western Australia. They were the survivors of some 12 or 15 who got ashore from the shipwreck of the barque

         is now the subject of an interesting little book written by an American descendant of one of those two men. All of the other survivors from the shipwreck perished on the North West Cape. The reason that the two survived was that after the local Aboriginal people had watched the numbers get down from, I think, 12 or 15 to two they took these two under their wing and kept them alive. They did not wait out of some hatred of white people; they did it simply because they knew, and it was clearly understood by the two young people who survived and whose papers are now recorded in this book, that they could not support more than two extra souls in their piece of territory on the North West Cape.

         I bring that to the attention of the House for the simple reason that that is the starting point for Aboriginal welfare in Australia. That is what they had had for the oft-mentioned 40,000 years. That is why their population apparently seldom moved from a number of 300,000. When we read and hear many of the remarks of many people, that simple story should be taken into account. I recommend the book to all and sundry. Of course, we Tuckeys were a very exploring and innovative crowd in those days. We were up there pearling and doing all the things that mattered to develop Western Australia. It is a very interesting example of the living standards of the Aboriginal people as long ago as 150 years—not very long ago—to be drawn to the attention of people.

         The second fact that I think is of historical importance is the much mentioned changes to the Constitution. I am one of those who participated in the referendum at that time and cast a vote. The Parliament would be interested to know that I cast a Yes vote. It is the only time I have ever voted yes in a referendum—and my experience and observations of what has happened since has convinced me never to do it again. But it is an interesting piece of paper because most people today—certainly not those in this debate—did not participate in that referendum. Few are aware that at that time only a Yes case was published. Further, very few understand what was said in the Yes case. It was these words:

        This would not mean that the States would automatically lose their existing powers.

The Commonwealth's object will be to co-operate with the States to ensure that together we act in the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia.

         If the people of 1967 were to sit with us tonight and look back over the period that has passed since then, one might wonder how they would vote today. There is only one certainty: by most of the actions of this Commonwealth Government and this Commonwealth Parliament since then, we have turned the majority of white Australians against the Aboriginal people. We have probably reversed that percentage.

         I was rather interested in the reaction of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and his personal attack upon a radio journalist in Western Australia who operates a talkback program. His name is Howard Sattler. Is it not amazing how we can pick on people? He told us what he said. He said, `Good riddance to three car thieves'. That is apparently racist. Sattler never referred to these people's ethnic background or their colour. It is a presumption of the honourable member for Moreton that they were black. I bet that at this point in time he has not one scrap of proof as to what colour they were other than that he, apparently, is also convinced that black kids pinch more cars than white kids.

         —Of course, this is an argument for Aboriginal people, not for governments spending money. In recent times a number of members of this House have received a call from some educational group—I think it is the university here—surveying us on various issues as members of parliament. I think we have all been asked the same questions. One of the questions I was asked was, `Do you think we should give Aboriginals more help?' to which I replied, `Yes, but less money'. We have had a group of failures—might I say from both sides of politics—that have thrown money at the problem. Please remember that most of these people we are talking about who committed suicide in gaol have done so since the honourable member for Melbourne Ports departed his job as Minister, so apparently his money throwing exercise did not prevent that situation. He might like to answer to this Parliament why it did not, if he wants to start criticising others and throwing a couple of common terms around.

         My view is that the money has been wasted. But what are we debating tonight? We are debating another $150m of the same. There is very little in these suggestions that will help Aboriginal people other than one particular group. I am reminded about those sorts of people by another black man. He happened to be American and a professor. His name was Walter Williams and he made a more general remark about the American welfare system which I think is extremely applicable to what this Government or this Parliament has done over time in terms of attempting to assist Aboriginal people. He termed their welfare program as the process of feeding sparrows through horses, which he said was a most desirable way of feeding sparrows from the horses' point of view. The major contribution of our expenditure programs is to make heaps and heaps of horses. We have got them all over the place, and honourable members can look even at the budgets of some of the land councils to find out how much or how little they have over after they have administered the money. It is a disgrace. This is the fundamental point of my complaint and my objection.

         We have taken all sorts of high moral decisions. Most Aboriginals still live in poverty. Most Aboriginals in recent times have suffered the tragedies that are mentioned in this report. So I tell honourable members: we have a new bloke. Let us hope that his solutions are going to work, but do not let me hear a word from any of his predecessors because, in truth, most of them were parties to these dreadful events. Nevertheless, I wish people would stop—as one speaker has tonight and, as the Minister did—making this rather stupid statistical comparison which suggests that 8,500 whites would have died if they could have been equated with Aborigines. It is a silly example and not worthy of this Parliament.

         I also criticise the suggestion that we are going to spend some $5m of this money on teaching our police force more about Aboriginal culture and heritage. We have three levels of law in this country: there is the legislature, us; there is the police, charged, as I understand, with administering that law; and, of course, there is the judiciary charged with interpreting the law to the extent that it is necessary and from time to time punishing people who break that law. I do not know how anybody can confuse those three groups of people with instructions that the law varies according to one's culture and heritage.

         It is a great tragedy of world society that numerous cultures seem to think that murdering people is quite satisfactory. Around the Mediterranean there is one group of people, who shall remain nameless, who have had a culture and heritage of sawing off shotguns and imposing their will upon the judiciary by blowing up their motor cars; and they believe that they have that superior right. Is it being suggested in this place that our police force is somehow going to have to give special rights to such people because their culture is different from others? Of course not. It is outrageous to suggest that the police force has the people who should be able to make decisions based on that category.

The constable apprehends him, handcuffs him to the car door handle, gets on the radio back to police headquarters and says, `I have just caught this individual. What shall I do next?'. They say, `What is his ethnic background?'. The constable says, `I think he is a so-and-so'. The base says, `No. We do not want any of those this week. We have enough'. That is the 8,500 examples. It is foolish and it is wrong to tell our judiciary and our police force that they will make judgments on an ethnic background. If those opposite want to change the laws here for that specific purpose, let them do so, but they should not expect people whose job it is not to write the law to do it in other places.

         In giving this brief overview, I hope that I can give some impetus to the Government's response and show how imperative it is to have a continued monitoring of that response. Much has been done but more, of course, has to be done. I guess one of the most startling statistics to come out of the Royal Commission is the fact that Aboriginal people are the most gaoled race per head of population in the world. This is in my view an outrageous indictment of our justice system. The Royal Commission produced a seven volume report that details the immediate and the underlying factors that have led to this deplorable state of affairs. Many of my grassroots experiences point to the same factors.

         When I first appeared as a solicitor on Mornington Island, retained by an Aboriginal legal service, I was introduced to the routine. Mornington Island is about 1 1/2 hours on a small charter plane directly north of Mount Isa in the Gulf of Carpentaria. It looks like a tropical island paradise but the apparent beauty hides horrific social and environmental health problems. With no rate base, the council has to raise finances through alcohol sales. Yet the more grog that is sold, the more social problems result. The then routine was that I flew as a defence lawyer on the charter flight with the magistrate and the prosecuting police sergeant. Sometimes, would you believe, witnesses were also on the same plane.

         On arrival, we were picked up by the local police and taken to the courthouse—and I use that term very loosely, because it was simply the Mornington Island police station with a desk moved to another position. I was put in a situation where I had to interview my clients under a tree outside the police station. The police actually described this tree as the `guilty tree' because they believed that everyone who sat under the tree was obviously guilty. In 42 degrees celsius heat this was an intolerable situation. The magistrate, would you believe, would often pace up and down the police station verandah with the prosecutor, suggesting that I hurry up as lunchtime was drawing near.

         Often clients would make allegations of police brutality, brutality that actually took place in the police station—in fact, in the same room that was now the courthouse, supposedly dispensing independent justice. Sometimes the policeman against whom the allegation was made was even acting as the court orderly during the first mention of the matter before the court. No wonder Aboriginal people could not understand this so-called independent system of justice.

         But let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, it gets worse. If an Aboriginal client chose to go to trial before a higher court, or was committed for trial, that trial actually took place in Mount Isa. More often than not the client had no way of getting to Mount Isa and was brought down under a warrant of arrest. This, of course, prejudiced the case from the outset. In the five years that I was with this Aboriginal legal service, I do not recall ever having an Aboriginal person on a jury for the trial of an Aboriginal person. The jury system—and the words of the late Lionel Murphy are still echoing in my ears from last night's ABC program—is supposed to be the cornerstone of our entire justice system. Trial by our peers, we are all told. To Aboriginal people from Mornington Island and Doomadgee, this is absolute nonsense.

         Jury panels in Queensland are taken from State electoral rolls. Until recently Mornington Island and Doomadgee were in a different State electorate from that for Mount Isa. People from these areas did not even get a chance to be tried by their peers. If an Aboriginal person was acquitted of an offence in the District or Supreme Court in Mount Isa this was not the end of the matter. It was then that person's personal responsibility to get home. People from Mornington Island had no hope of getting employment in Mount Isa to pay for their expensive fare home. They were looking at over $200 one way to get from Mount Isa to Mornington Island and, of course, it is impossible to drive to the island. Too often clients in this situation would find themselves stuck in a most unfamiliar and unfriendly city. This could lead to depression, which could lead to alcohol abuse, which could lead to another encounter with the law. It was, and too often still is, a traumatising experience.

         Let me briefly tell the House about Alistair Riversleigh. I represented his family before the Royal Commission. On page 21 of the regional report of the inquiry in Queensland, Alistair Riversleigh's tragic death is described under the heading of `Deaths that should be avoided now'. Alistair Riversleigh hanged himself in police custody after he displayed an apparent intention to hang himself with a garden hose in his own home. He was arrested and put in the lockup for his own protection by two Aboriginal policemen and was then left unsupervised in the watch-house. Those police had not received any formal training in policing. The report says:

         It should have been readily apparent to a trained police officer that a person in Riversleigh's emotional state who had already threatened to commit suicide was at risk of harming himself. The possibility of this potential being realised should have been even more apparent following the publicity given to three hangings in the Yarrabah Watchhouse in the three and half months immediately preceding Riversleigh's death. The fact that the two Aboriginal policemen did not appreciate that Riversleigh was at risk of harming himself can in no way be regarded as a personal criticism of them but rather as an indictment on the system which allowed untrained and unsupervised Aboriginal policemen to perform police duties. Had the police at Doomadgee been properly trained and supervised, Riversleigh's death should not have occurred.

        Despite these comments and, indeed, the many specific recommendations of the Commission to address this issue, deaths such as this are still occurring. On Mornington Island last year a young man died in the watch-house in circumstances that could have been avoided had the Queensland police concerned implemented the interim recommendations of the Commission, including recommendations to provide formal training for Aboriginal police.

         In the past, it seems to me, there has been an almost deliberate attempt by non-Aboriginal public servants working in Aboriginal communities to preserve their own jobs, their own empires, by ensuring that appropriate training of Aboriginal people never took place. If Aboriginal people could be shown to be incapable of managing themselves, the white bureaucrats would be needed for longer and longer periods, milking the communities of money, self-esteem and, worst of all, hope. This is still happening today. It must be stopped.

         This is where the Government's response to the Royal Commission is critical. I believe the experiences I have just related reflect the level of institutionalised racism and discrimination in the justice system as a result of 200 years of dispossession and cultural devastation. The Royal Commission addressed all these issues, and its recommendations must be implemented and taken seriously at all levels if we are to make any significant steps towards remedying Aboriginal disadvantage.

         One aspect of the response by the Government to the Royal Commission that is close to my heart and hopefully will address many of the issues I have spoken of tonight is the decision to implement the recommendations relating to the Aboriginal legal services. The Royal Commission has recommended an expanded role for legal services in the research of law reform issues; representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander juveniles; periodic visits to prisoners; representation of families at coronial inquests; legal representation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people making complaints against police; developing protocols governing the interaction of police and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; participating in the establishment of national standard guidelines for correctional institutions; designing and delivering training programs to police and staff at custodial institutions; developing protocols for the conduct of inquiries and autopsies; developing strategies to encourage and enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to use anti-discrimination legislation more effectively; providing legal assistance to individuals and organisations wishing to object to the granting or renewal of liquor licences; and, of course, in a number of other areas.

         The consultative and law reform role of the Aboriginal legal services does not end with the response of governments to the Royal Commission's recommendations. On the contrary, governments' responses specifically identify the important continuing role of the services in law reform issues, a role which has remained largely unfulfilled because of the lack of resources. Similarly, the role of Aboriginal legal services in representing families of the deceased needs to continue as a result of a number of recommendations.

         As I have said before in this House, it is all well and good to have done the research and identified some of the causes of the tragedy of Aboriginal deaths in custody, but it is another thing altogether for us to act—and I mean all governments of Australia. We must also act to change individual attitudes. In 1992 we cannot continue to have people contacting me as the Federal member for Kennedy and telling me how absolutely disastrous the riots in Los Angeles were, not because of the tragedy of what occurred, but because—and I quote from a constituent—`the blacks in Australia might get similar crazy ideas and do the same things as they saw the American blacks doing on TV'.

         It will not be easy to break down 200 years of institutionalised racism. Aboriginal people are certainly resilient and strong—and, of course, they have to be. The establishment of ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, in conjunction with a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's watchdog role, should be sufficient to ensure that institutionalised racism is smashed and that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to participate fully, equally and proudly in Australian society.

         —I rise to inform the House about a new employee of mine—a wonderful young lady called Elizabeth—not so much because of this particular lady, who is very special, but because of the circumstances in which she came to my employ. Elizabeth arrived unannounced with her husband in my office and demanded to see me, stating that her neighbours had told her that if she had problems Mary was the person to see. She also added, `I'm subnormal; I'm not allowed to have children and so I'm here to see Mary'. This lady has spent more than a decade in the employ of an organisation in Queensland known as the Endeavour Foundation. Indeed, she came to my office clasping a letter which stated that this lady had gone from a salary of $68 a fortnight to $15 a fortnight, which was part of the Federal Labor Government's policy.

         I know that the Opposition tends to draw a fine line at times, but one could also ask how the Endeavour Foundation can actually push such a notion. Indeed, it would appear that, after intervention by the Federated Clerks Union on behalf of the employees at the Endeavour Foundation mail centre and the receipt of back pay by most of those employees, Endeavour decided that it would in fact cut the pay of its clients under the slow worker award but not that of its administrators, its full clerical staff or, indeed, its social workers and other people. It was quite extraordinary. So Elizabeth found herself in a situation whereby it cost her $16 a fortnight to go on the train to work, for which she received a mere $15.

         The whole issue raises yet again the question of the kind of employment people have, the kind of pay they get and the reason why Endeavour exists. As many people here know, the Endeavour Foundation—which started life as the Queensland Subnormal Children's Welfare Association in the 1950s—was at the forefront of training and programs for those people in our community who had special needs. However, 40 years later this organisation is unable to move down the path of training or, indeed, make any other kind of progress. The organisation has refused to recognise that very many of the people who work there are in fact entitled to real wages.

         However, that is not the case for those companies which actually solicit the services of the Endeavour Foundation. Indeed, I believe the Endeavour Foundation is paid full commercial rates by those companies which engage the services of the Endeavour Foundation and its workers. As one who has visited the wonderful and beautiful house at Bowen Hills, which is the headquarters of Endeavour Foundation, I certainly know that no expense has been spared. It has wonderful gold-plated taps in the toilets and a beautiful boardroom, banquet room and other facilities. Not very many people with disabilities have been able to visit there—after all, they are only the people for whom this service is in place.

         Yet again, we are forced to ask in this House: what is it that drives Endeavour? How is it able to exploit the services of people with special needs? Indeed, in the case of Elizabeth, who has now come to work for us and who stated that she could only fold things in half, it has been shown that she can fold in thirds, fourths, fifths and sixths. She can work the franking machine, collect the mail and perform a whole range of other things and earn considerably more than $15 a fortnight in terms of real pay. Why was Endeavour claiming that she was only able to earn this kind of money when its commercial rates were somewhat different?

         The whole question of payments to people with disabilities has to be raised with regard to another organisation in my electorate—Keystone—which is now going to charge people $50 a week to work under what can only be described as slave labour conditions. One has to ask: what kind of person is running this operation? The person who is running it is the endorsed Liberal candidate for one of our State seats. This surely is taking user-pays to the ultimate: those people with disabilities pay to be exploited by an organisation. What is even worse is that it is an organisation which is sponsored by a church organisation in our community.

         —I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House another matter which relates to the retail motor trades in Australia and their relationship with the auto manufacturing industry. The case concerns an Adelaide motor dealer, Mr John Rickus, the dealer principal of the firm Yorke Motors. Yorke Motors has been established for 40 years and its franchises included Mitsubishi and Alfa Romeo.

         In 1982 Mr Rickus acquired for his business a franchise for the Italian manufacturer Alfa Romeo. This was initially successful and resulted in a continuing dealer agreement through until the end of 1991. In September 1991, a short time after the arrival of a new managing director from Italy, Mr Dario Novara, without any prior warning, let alone consultation, the dealership was suddenly terminated. This left the dealer holding specialist equipment and stock of unsold motor vehicles and parts. Mr Rickus understood that his contract permitted Alfa Romeo to make this decision. His immediate first response was to ask what was proposed to be done with the new vehicle stock and the unsold spare parts stock. At the time, the dealer was holding four cars with a retail value of $174,000 and over $100,000 worth of parts.

         On 18 October Alfa Romeo offered to buy back the parts and stock for the amount of just over $20,000. This offer for stock valued at over $270,000 was not accepted—and frankly, in my opinion, quite rightly so. The agreement with the dealer, however, provides that products remaining with the dealer shall be sold back to Alfa Romeo if requested by it. This is quite unconscionable treatment, given that Alfa Romeo only offers its agreement for a period of 12 months. This clearly, therefore, gives Alfa a strong bargaining position in setting a value on the stock involved.

         Mr Rickus is an upright and highly respected Adelaide businessman. He has served in many voluntary capacities and has dedicated much of his time to pursuing the interests of his members, who are drawn from the 40,000 small businesses who make up the retail motor trades. He currently serves as the National President of the Motor Trades Association of Australia—a position of considerable eminence and prestige.

       <para>
        effectively walked away from its obligations. Further representations to Alfa Romeo led to an initial agreement to meet on 20 December 1991, but later Alfa asked that the meeting be delayed until the first week of February 1992. After some discussion, attempts to arrange meetings proved fruitless.

         The situation that has resulted is that a dealer, having made a very significant investment, is now in the position of not owning a franchise and, therefore, being unable to give a warranty on vehicles he may sell. The dealer is therefore unable to recover the value of his investment in any way, either by sale or return. It is totally unconscionable, in my view, that he be placed in such a situation.

         I believe that this is a classic case whereby a franchisee has been subject to unconscionable conduct. Unfortunately, the Trade Practices Act as it now stands does not give a dealer a remedy or a right of action where such unconscionable conduct occurs. I believe that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) must amend the law to provide for a right of action which will enable someone in Mr Rickus's position to seek redress.

The cost to the dealer in stock, capital investment, retrenchment and redundancy payments alone can be upwards of half a million dollars.

         In the case under dispute what must be made very clear to Alfa Romeo is that this is clearly unacceptable behaviour for a corporate citizen from a foreign country. Both Alfa Romeo and Mr Novara need to understand that reference solely to the provisions and obligations of the dealer agreement is a sad reflection on the company's attitude. Reliance on contracts rather than the establishment of a working relationship which goes well beyond the contractual provisions is short-sighted and unfair and only gives Australians a dim view of how some countries conduct their business affairs. Failure even to agree to meet face to face is intransigent and uncivilised.

         It may be that Alfa Romeo is undergoing a difficult time itself. Its share of the market for quality European cars in Australia has slipped well below that of Saab, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi and Volvo. Even the Russian made Lada is now outselling Alfa Romeo in Australia. However, that is no excuse for treating decent Australian businessmen in this way.

They are concerned that there have been some alleged cutbacks in Federal Government support for the Catholic school system. In particular, the parents of children attending two Catholic schools in my electorate, St Elizabeth Parish School at Ekibin and St Agnes School at Mount Gravatt, have more specifically raised this question and have organised public meetings about the issue. They have sought some information from me about this matter.

         The situation is that there has been no cutback in grants by this Government to the Catholic school system or to the non-government sector. In fact, since 1984 there have been real increases each year in government grants to non-government schools. As all honourable members know, the Government does not make grants to individual systemic schools; it makes the grants to the systems running the schools, for example, the State government, the Catholic system or the Lutheran system. It is then up to those systems to distribute the money to the individual schools.

         Taking inflation into account, grants to the Catholic system from the Federal Government have grown in real terms each year for the last eight years. In December 1991 price terms, in 1984 Catholic schools received $1,048 for each child; in 1992 they received $1,298 for each child. That is a real increase, after inflation, of almost 24 per cent. The Federal Government proposes to continue this growth pattern over the rest of the decade with real increases of almost 15 per cent. I think that is a very important point to make. It clearly demonstrates that this Government has met and continues to meet its obligations to all schools in our community, whether they are government or non-government schools. In fact, Labor spends $1.3 billion a year.

Of these schools, 250 are new schools which have been funded since the election of the Labor Government in 1983. It is important to compare this with the $1.2 billion which Labor has spent on over two million State school students. Therefore, there is in fact a clear distortion in Commonwealth Government funds to the non-government sector. These schools do not receive as much funding from the State governments, as the State governments run their own systems. The Commonwealth Government meets its requirements by providing that significant boost. I think it is very important to note that. As I said, there has been a real increase of 24 per cent in government funding over the last eight years.

         The Queensland Catholic Education Office is apparently making claims about cuts in Commonwealth funding because of its dissatisfaction with the amount of money provided by the Federal Government to meet the award restructuring requirement. Unfortunately, this dissatisfaction has come about because of a misinterpretation of what the Federal Government would do.

In fact, the Federal Government met its promised share, 41 per cent of the cost, which is based on the community standard on which all grants were set.

Like many perceptions, the reality is quite different. In fact, the chill winds of the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said `we had to have' are severely affecting an increasing number of Warringah constituents. That is not just hearsay, it is borne out by the Jobstart and Newstart unemployment statistics for the area.

At this stage I have concentrated my analysis on the Manly and Dee Why statistics.

         I ask the House to consider that over the 12 months from April 1991 to April 1992, unemployment in Australia increased by 34 per cent; in New South Wales it increased by 40 per cent; in Manly it increased by 60 per cent; and in Dee Why it increased by 65 per cent. Significantly, over the last Christmas break Manly had the second highest increase in unemployment—nearly 11 per cent—of the 76 New South Wales regional offices, while Dee Why was the fourth highest at nearly 9 per cent. Furthermore, over the past 24 months, at both Dee Why and Manly, there have been only two months in which unemployment did not increase. In other words, there has been a steady, dogged upward increase, month after month, for almost two years.

They are just statistics, but the effect on people is tragic: careers ruined, personal frustration, loss of self-esteem and, for many, a lifetime of emotional scars.

         None of this is ever acknowledged by the Prime Minister. Rather, when we hear him it is like listening to a hyperactive statistician with nothing but ratios, percentages and numbers.

These people are not numbers. They are fellow Australians who put their trust in a Labor Government in 1983 and are now paying the price. As Australia started to sink into this economic mire in mid-1990, the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, had the affront to tell us that these are definitely the golden years of change.

         —Tonight I want to raise an issue of great concern to the people of my electorate. It is a matter I have spoken about previously in this House: the decision of the Greiner Government to build a tollway in western Sydney. When I last raised this issue in the House, at that stage it was still a proposal that was under consideration. The tollway that will be the Greiner Government's bequest to the residents of western Sydney opened about three weeks ago and the very worst fears of the people of western Sydney about this particular road development have been realised.

         By way of background, the decision to build the tollway section on the missing link of what was the F4 from Mays Hill to Prospect meant that, in order to try to recoup the funds to the private developer of the road, the Greiner Government decided to place a toll on a section of the freeway that had been built several years ago—in fact paid for with Federal road moneys; about $38m in all—between Silverwater Road and James Rouse Drive. That was a totally inappropriate place to build such a tollway. It was not a section that was being fast-tracked with the private developer; rather, it was a decision to apply the user pays principle to the nth degree by the State Government. As I said, the net result has been that the New South Wales Government decided it would make motorists pay for the road the second time, Federal road funds having being used to build the existing section of road.

         All attempts to get the State Government of New South Wales to reconsider this decision, to point out the injustices and the unfairness of the decision, have failed. The State Government held an election and lost two seats largely because of the freeway issue in western Sydney. In spite of that, it still decided that the motorists and the people of western Sydney were to be slugged, as is the usual tory approach.

         Since that decision, the Greiner Government felt it was appropriate to write to the Federal Minister to ask for approval to put a tax on the existing section of road. Very properly, the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) refused the request. Nevertheless, in its usual arrogant way, the State Government decided to proceed with the toll on that section of the road anyway. As I say, the motorway opened three weeks ago. The fears that people in the region had—that is, people would seek to use alternatives to the freeway, therefore adding greatly to the congestion and the danger of other arterial and local roads—have been realised. People are bypassing the toll; they are using alternative means, which will jeopardise the cash flow that all the projections of the private developer were based on. More importantly, they are creating more danger and more hazards to local residents because of the damage that is being done and the increased traffic in local streets.

         No compensation has been provided to the local government authorities in the region in order to safeguard the assets and the needs of motorists and residents in the region.

         A few clear points can be made about the State Government's attempt at this ultimate in the user pays concept that it has adopted. Firstly, the people of the region are most irate at this stage about the F4 tollway and will maintain their rage in that regard right through to when the very shaky Greiner Government is forced to go to the people once again, and no doubt they will cast their judgment accordingly. Secondly, the State Opposition in New South Wales has made it very clear that, when it is elected to government, one of its first initiatives will be to remove the toll, and it will rightly be restored as a freeway serving the over 1.6 million people who live in the western Sydney region.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are a couple of other points that should be made. It is important, I believe, that the Federal Minister for Land Transport have Federal officials look at what the impact will be in terms of Federal road grants. Clearly, there are going to be increasing demands in the region to have extra funding provided for roads because of the actions of the State Government in taking away the balance that existed quite properly between funds raised at the Federal level and locally raised funds.

         It should also be noted that in New South Wales there is already a major levy, a 3 x 3 road levy, that would be an alternative and more acceptable way of funding these sorts of structures, rather than the user-pays approach that has been followed by the State Government. As I say, it is one which no doubt the Liberals at the national level would seek to emulate throughout the country. So I strongly oppose this development.

         —I really must respond to some of the points that have just been made by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott). I find them absolutely extraordinary. He sounded so confused. He started by saying that because people were not using a road that did not exist until it was opened, this added to congestion. I must admit that I find that very hard to understand in terms of simple logic. The road did not exist until it was opened the other day, yet the honourable member said that it had created more congestion—presumably because a lot of people are using the road. So I am not quite sure of the logic.

         He then went on to say that if a Labor government were elected in New South Wales, it would remove that toll. I think he ought to have gone on and explained to the people of New South Wales what that would be likely to cost. My understanding is that the freeway has cost at least $230m. To break the contract may incur some penalties and it could cost more. If that is the case, presumably a Labor government would have to find that money and that would mean that funding which would have gone into other roads would no longer be available.

         He then went on to say that there may be some examination of the current balance of Federal funding to the State of New South Wales because of this road. Yet, clearly, it has been funded by private sources through institutions and the like. How that can be seen to be a reason to cut road funding for New South Wales is quite beyond me. I think, frankly, it is showing some initiative. If the honourable member were to be completely fair and honest about it, he would acknowledge—he knows it as well as everyone else—that despite the fact that the State Government has increased the amount of money going into roads, the Federal Government has been cutting it back steadily year after year.

         In fact, in the last seven years up to the February economic statement, the amount of money going into roads was cut by about 20 per cent in real terms. At the same time, the amount of fuel tax collected from motorists was increased by 120 per cent. If we look at the amount of money that has been allocated to roads in the February economic statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we see that all it does in real terms is restore the level of Federal funding to roads to what it was in 1983-84. Some big deal that the Government makes such a song and dance about!  So if we want to see why the New South Wales Government has gone to the trouble of trying to improve its roads by using other sources of finance and using a toll, I think we would have to look no further than the fact that the Federal Government has cut back on the amount of money that it has been putting into roads.

        Yes. The details sought by the honourable member are as follows.  In relation to the information, it is relevant that the periods of travel by the current and previous chief executives relate to activities associated with two different Organisations.  The functions of ANSTO are fundamentally different to those of its predecessor organisation, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC).  A particular aspect of the establishment of ANSTO in 1987 was to create a more outward-looking, commercially oriented agency with strengthened regional/international linkages.
