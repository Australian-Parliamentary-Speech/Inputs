I intend to make a few charges against, the officer who furnished the Minister with that report, with the desire to throw dust into his eyes as to the real cause of the resignations, and also against the Minister for unwittingly throwing dust into the eyes of members of this Parliament and the people of Australia. The first charge I make is that a large amount of matter was suppressed in thereport. </para>

                        can shut his eyes and take  his  pick. My second charge is that the reports which were furnished to the Minister were deliberately altered; and my third charge is that, an amount of matter was introduced Co divert attention from the real point at issue. In regard to the first charge, a report is given from the officer commanding the Fifth Company of the Garrison Artillery, who is stated therein to be Captain Forsyth. He is the  officer  commanding the Fourth Company of the Garrison Artillery. If the report quoted is to be attributed to him, then the report of Lieutenant M. Chaseling has been deliberately suppressed. He sent in a report on his company, but it did not appear with the others. It is entirely different, I am given to understand, from those which were supplied. I do not know whether it was through a mistake, or to excuse themselves, that the wrong officer was put down as commanding that company. In regard to the 'alterations, it has already been shown that the transposition in order of importance of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Major Warren's</inline>
                        reasons for the crisis puts a different complexion on the whole business. It. has been suggested that the abolition of the regimental staff of the Fifth Garrison Artillery was the least important reason tor the resignations. In point of fact, that officer thinks that it comes first. The reasons for the resignations as given by Captain Forsyth are the increased length of continuous training, fines for non-efficiency, the restrictions on smoking, and the reorganization doing away with the regimental staff. It is well, known in New South Wales, and also well known to the Minister and to the officers, that the re-organization should have been put first as the cause of this trouble. In the report it was put last, so that it should appear as a very minor -point in the issue. In regard to my third charge, namely, the introduction of extraneous matter, the Minister's advisers have tried to minimize the actual, cause of the crisis by reporting that the regulations were the sole cause of the crisis. That they were wrong is proved by Friday night's parade, which was looked upon as a criterion of the effect of the Minister's concessions.
                    </para>
                    <para>In no company was there a greater attendance than twelve men out of an establishment o£  125,  which clearly proves that the concession of the Minister, as reported in the papers, had not the desired effect. The report of Gunner McClean  is put forward as one of the reasons:' That is the flimsiest reason put forward and is most farcical, giving one the idea' that he is leading of Gilbert and Sullivan instead of a regimental staff of the Commonwealth. The report states that no candles- were available, whereas it is well known that the  magazine regulations demand that candles of different lengths shall be kept in magazines at all times. The reason for the rule is that the candles cannot all go out at once, and should always be available. The Minister prates of the surprise attacks that these forts are going to get. The surprise is that a' company turn up to drill and the forts are not prepared for them. How are you going to act if you get a surprise attack from a hostile fleet? </para>
                    <para class="block">I  will not say any more about that part of the subject, because I know Gunner McClean  to be a very good officer. I now have to draw attention to what I call a deliberate misrepresentation. Captain Forsyth says that at a regimental dinner of the Australian Garrison Artillery great dissatisfaction was expressed by the men on the subject of the abolition of the regimental staff. Captain Forsyth places that as the first reason, but it was given last amongst the reasons adduced by the Minister. I was present at the regimental dinner in question, and heard all the speeches made there. Speeches were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riley,</inline> M.P., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. West,</inline> M.P., and myself. Not a word was said there that was calculated to rouse the enthusiasm of this fine regiment - the finest in Australia - by inducing it to go on strike because of the conditions imposed. I say that the officer who gave that as a reason for what has occurred has been wilfully endeavouring to mislead the Minister, and the Minister in his turn has misled the people. The real cause of the trouble is the discharge of the commander of the regiment, a militia officer whom I have known for a great many years, and against whose ability no one can say a word. He was appointed about nine months ago - it may be a little more - to command the regiment for a term of five years.  His  appointment was very popular with the regiment. He has won such a kindly feeling amongst the whole of the men that they believe that he has been unfairly and unjustly treated by the Defence authorities in being deposed from the position which he had so honorably gained. No adequate reason has been given for his deposition, but it is believed that the Military Board and the military authorities in New South Wales desired to get rid of him. As the Minister is aware, I brought this matter under his notice some time ago. When Parliament was in recess I wrote to the Prime Minister that I was willing to come to Melbourne to lay the facts before him, but I was not afforded that opportunity. The regiment have all along been waiting for some response from the Department, hoping that their commander would be allowed to fulfil the term for which he was appointed. The Minister told us in his reply last week that- </para>

                        <para>Lord Kitchener recommended that, as the guns were now of such a highly technical character, there should be two reliefs of permanent troops, and that the command of fortresses should, in all cases, be in the hands of permanent officers. That recommendation has been backed up from time to time by other permanent officers. It has been represented that, in case of war, any attack upon our forts would probably be in the nature of a surprise attack, and that, therefore, the officers in command should reside close to them. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">If they get a surprise attack, what about the candles? The Minister forgot when he made this statement that the officer appointed as fortress commander must and does reside at Victoria Barracks, and that the officer who has been deposed lives within a few yards of the barracks. So that nothing could be urged against him on that score. If honorable senators look into Lord Kitchener's recommendations they will see that he says that on account of the highly technical character of modern guns they should be in charge of permanent troops. If the Military Board intend to carry out Lord Kitchener's recommendations, the first thing they would do would be to put the guns in the hands of permanent troops. That they have not attempted to do. To have even one relief of permanent men in charge of the guns would involve the engagement of eighty-four additional permanent men. To provide a second relief we should require a great many more. The authorities have not attempted to carry out that part of Lord Kitchener's recommendation. The officer commanding this regiment never was a fortress commander in New South Wales. The fortress commander has, for a number of years at all events, been a permanent officer. There must be some reason, of which we know nothing, when the authorities attempt to remove an officer who has nothing to do with the technical management of the guns. I may say that I am with the Board, and with the Minister, in regard to carrying out this particular recommendation, and as soon as it can be carried out by putting these men - who, generally speaking, are mechanics - into the Permanent Forces, I shall be glad to see it done. But that has nothing to do with the protest made by the Australian Garrison Artillery against the unjust treatment meted out to their commander. I am aware that the Minister knows nothing personally about these men. He is merely the political head of the Defence Department. He admits that he knows nothing. In a case of this description I think it is a pity that in his spare time - and I know that he has some- </para>

                            <para>- The position of fortress commander need not necessarily be held by an artillery man at all. The fortress commander needs to. know nothing whatever about battery work. The fire commander comes next. He occupies what I think they call "a cell," that is to say, a little house in which he watches for the coming of the enemy. When he sees the enemy coming, he has machinery at his disposition to find out how far the ship is away, and what kind of a vessel she is. With this information he knows what kind of gun will be needed to reach her. When he has ascertained that information, he immediately telephones or communicates in some other way with the battery commander. The battery commander has entire charge of the battery, but he has nothing to do with the technical working of the guns. The -next officer in the series is the gun group commander. This officer has charge of the group that runs a gun. Every man has his position detailed to him when he is taken out of his company and set to work the guns. Every man knows exactly what he has to do. So that the fortress commander, the fire commander, and the battery commander, have nothing to do with the technical parts of the guns. That work is under the direction of the gun group commander. He is the man who is charged with the firing of the gun. . He has the technical work to do, and has the business at his fingers' ends. I mention this in order to show that by removing the commander of the regiment from the position of fire commander, and still leaving a militiaman in charge, the Minister has not alone a single thing to carry out the recommendation of Lord Kitchener. When he was prepared to do so it would have been time enough to remove the militia officer from the command of the regiment. I propose to deal now with another matter. 1 do not know whether it involves a charge. At last Friday night's parade, an officer attended to try and induce the gunners not to leave the regiment. I should like to say first of all that that should never have been done. As a matter of. policy, directly a. soldier sends in his resignation he should be discharged. The Minister stepped down when he tried to induce these men to rejoin the regiment. I know that he did so because he is aware that these men cannot be done without, and that if an attack were made upon Sydney without the assistance of these men we should be in a ridiculous position, because the guns, and forts would be useless for our defence. </para>

The officer who represented the Military Board at last Friday night's parade, and whose duty it was to make representations to the men to induce them not to leave the regiment, said to them,. " The regulations are very severe in connexion with cigarette smoking; but, of course, we officers will not be hard on you. If we see you smoking, we will look the other way. There is no canteen to be allowed in the militia camp, but we have a canteen always for the permanent men,: and I will see that the right man is put in charge." Those were nice representations to make on behalf of the Minister and the Military Board to induce these men. to withdraw their resignations. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister had stepped down so far as to say to the men that things would be as they were before the  30th  June, and that they would have their commander back in charge of the regiment within a certain time, there is not one man in that regiment who would not have been prepared, in spite of the taunts of disloyalty hurled at them, to have: shed his blood in the defence of his country. The fact is that the men felt and knew that an injustice had been done to their commander, and rather than put up with that they were determined to give up soldiering altogether as a protest against the unfair treatment meted out to this officer. </para>

                            <para>-The Vice-President of the Executive Council is trying to throw a little more dust, but I do not take any notice of him. He is only saying what the Government have already said. He is suggesting that the action taken by these men was due to the prohibition of cigarettes and drinking, and I am trying to show that it was due to nothing of the sort, but to their resentment, because of the injustice done to their commander, who was one of themselves, and had risen from the ranks to the top of the tree. In my daily avocations I have been associated with these men for many years. I know that they have given up their spare time to military work instead of enjoying themselves, as other men have done, in witnessing the sports on a. Saturday afternoon. I know almost all of the men in the regiment; and I say it is unfair and unjust to say that it is because of the trivial matters to which I have referred that they decided to abandon their regimental duties. I direct attention to a remark of the Minister which, at the time it was made, I characterized as unfair. The honorable senator said - </para>

He said, " If I am to go out, I shall go out like a man ; but I do not want you men to send in your resignations." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> the honorable member for Illawarra, can testify to the correctness of the statement that, when at Wollongong recently, the half-company there had what they called a "dying" dinner; because they were all going to resign. Lieutenant Chaseling, who was there, in the presence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> said to the men, " Whatever you do, do not send in your resignations." He implored them to stick to their duty, and he had such a hold on the men, because he is one of themselves, that they did not send in their resignations. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister knew what the men were going to do, why did he not stand up like a man at the regimental dinner, and say, " I have done with this thing. Your commander has got to go. I am not prepared to retire from the position I have taken up." If the honorable senator had said that, the resignations of the men would have been in long ago. He said neither one thing nor the other. He held out no hope. He said, " When I am sick, I have to go to a doctor. When I want to know something about the military business, I go to a military man. This was the decision of the Military Board." If the honorable senator had said, " I shall stand by my guns, and_ your commander must go, every man in the room would have resigned the next day. The Minister should take up a dignified position. He should not descend, as he has done in this case, to little petty reasons for the resignations. He says that he knew what the men were going to do; and I say that the men at Wollongong were going to resign when the commanding officer, Lieutenant Chaseling, implored them to do nothing of the sort. When the Minister says that officers of the regiment induced men to resign, I say that the statement is as cowardly as it is false. </para>

If he was advised by his officers that it is correct, I am here to say that it is not; and I am prepared to prove that it is not correct. I ask the Minister to have an open inquiry into the matter, and give the men an opportunity to put their case forward, when I am sure they will come out on top. I have copies here of the criticisms of the action of the Department which were published in the New South Wales newspapers. I shall not weary honorable senators by reading them all; but I shall quote this statement, which was made in the public press. </para>

If honorable senators are permitted to quote newspaper extracts bearing upon replies to questions, they may as well be at liberty to quote press extracts referring to debates which have taken place in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to unduly limit debate, but I would point out that any question which is put to a Minister and answered by him may be quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in accordance with the standing order. The only prohibition imposed is in regard to extracts from newspapers or documents other than <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> referring to debates in the Senate during the same session. If an honorable senator chooses to quote any question or answer from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will be perfectly in order, but he will be out of order in quoting the criticism of newspapers in regard to the same subject. </para>

Then any other honorable senator as well as the senator putting the question can ask a question arising out of the reply. If the Minister is not prepared to reply to the further question, he can ask the senator by whom it is asked to give notice, and there the matter ends. I do not think that any honorable senator can construe such a proceeding as a debate, because there is no exchange or interchange of opinions on the matter immediately before the Senate. I think, sir, that unless your ruling be dissented from it will practically limit debate, and also prevent an honorable senator from getting information for the public. </para>

I think it is just possible, sir, that you have misunderstood 'the meaning of the word " question " in standing order 408. It does not mean a question asked of a Minister by an honorable senator in the ordinary way, but the question on a motion such as " That this Bill be now read a second time." In the parliamentary sense there has been no question put here this session which deals with the subject-matter of this particular inquiry, and as we also know there has been no debate which has brought the matter before the Senate. The only way in which it has ever been introduced has been in the form of a question to the Minister of Defence. I respectfully submit, sir, that the matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> wishes to refer cannot come under standing order 409. </para>

                    <para>If a question were asked in the other House, it could be alluded to here, notwithstanding our rule against referring to the debates in that House, showing clearly the distinction between a debate on a question and a mere reply to a question. Of course, if after the Minister had replied to a question, the adjournment of the Senate had been moved, and the question and the reply had been debated, it would not have been competent for an honorable senator to deal with the matter at another time unless we had a special standing order allowing that to be done. I think that on reconsideration, sir, you will see the marked distinction which I have pointed out. Very often a reply to a question is necessary in order to found a motion on which a debate can take place. </para>

                            <para>-  This motion raises a question of very great importance. There really is, I think, a good deal more to be said in favour of the ruling than would at first sight appear, although I am rather inclined to think that the matter could be better dealt with by an amendment of the standing order. There is no doubt that if we technically look at the standing order by itself, and interpret the word " debate"' in the ordinary sense, the comment which was proposed to be read has no relation to a debate as ordinarily understood. But the question is whether the meaning of the word "debate" in the standing order is not much more comprehensive than that, and does not include the proceedings of Parliament. The whole essence of this rule - which, in substance, applies equally in the House of Customs -is that it was intended to prevent the quotation from newspapers, not only of criticisms of the proceedings of Parliament, but of reports of speeches made in Parliament during the same session. That applies now. That is to say, no member of. the House of Commons is in order in quoting from a newspaper the report of a speech made in the House during the same session. If a member quotes at all, and the quotation is in relation to the same subject as is under debate, he must quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That is the foundation of our rule. All our proceedings in Parliament are, of course, privileged. The publication in the press of speeches made in Parliament is, in principle, a breach of parliamentary privilege. It is for that reason that the quotation from the reports of speeches in newspapers is not permitted in the House of Commons. The same rule appears to apply to the quotation from newspapers of comments upon the proceedings of Parliament. . Therefore, if the whole of the proceedings of Parliament are privileged from publication, that rule applies equally to answers to questions, and to anything else that is done within the walls of Parliament. It is obvious that it must be so. Honorable senators will find, on page 325 of May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> the whole position explained - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is because the publication in a newspaper of a speech made in Parliament is, in principle, a breach of privilege. </para>
                    <para>This rule, indeed, applies strictly to all debates whatsoever - </para>
                    <para class="block">In this connexion, " all debates " means "all proceedings," undoubtedly -  the publication of them being a breach of privilege; but of late years it has been relaxed, by general acquiescence in favour of speeches delivered in former sessions. It is also irregular to read extracts from newspapers, letters, or other documents referring to debates in the House in the same session. Indeed, until 1840, the reading of any extracts from a newspaper, whether referring to debates or not, had been restrained as irregular. On the 9th March, 1840, the  Speaker  having called a member to order, who was reading an extract cut out from a newspaper, as part of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel said it would be drawing the rule too tightly if members were restrained from reading relevant extracts from newspapers; and, with the acquiescence of the House, the member proceeded to read the passage from the newspaper. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps that would have been the best way out of this difficulty. If we examine the principle that underlies this rule, we find that it would apply to all the proceedings of Parliament, and, consequently, to all proceedings inside the Senate. They are all privileged in principle. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not know. If the honorable senator wants me to answer him more generally, I am not sure whether some of these restrictions, which served a very good purpose when they were imposed, ought not to be very much modified, if not altogether removed. I, for one, am in favour of the enlargement of the standing order, so as to permit of the quotation of material which not merely illustrates the subject-matter of debate, but which may illustrate the public opinion existing upon the subject-matter of debate. I think that, under this standing order 409, the question is, whether the expression referring to debates in the Senate during the same session means the proceedings of the Senate which, in principle, would be privileged from publication in the press, or whether it is to be restricted to debate as properly and ordinarily understood. I do not think that the standing order is by any means clear, and I am not prepared . to dissent from your ruling. </para>

I can indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said - that " debate," as referred to in the standing order, is open to more than one interpretation. When you, sir, gave your ruling I was inclined at the outset to think that it was perfectly correct, because I was under the impression that what was prohibited to be read in a debate was a newspaper extract commenting upon what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has called broadly the proceedings of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has asked what the object of the standing order was. If we could ascertain precisely what the object of it was, we should be far on the way to a solution of the proper construction of it. But it is very difficult to find what was the  wile  object of it. It must be read in conjunction with other standing orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has drawn attention to a previous standing order relating to questions and answers. There is another one to which I draw attention -  401.  It reads - </para>

                        <para>I will put this position as conceivable : Under standing order  401,  it might, in the strictly technical and narrow sense of the term, be competent for an honorable senator to read comments upon a reply given by a Minister. Suppose that an honorable senator asked a question upon some important subject. The Minister might furnish an answer, and subsequently to that, a newspaper might comment upon question and answer. That comment might be read by an honorable senator, and that comment might really be designed to be a speech upon the particular subject. So that, in that way, standing order  401  could be overcome, because the senator in question might say, "I am simply reading an extract from a newspaper commenting, not upon the debate, but upon an answer given by the Minister." </para>

                            <para>-  He might do that. Consequently the effect and substance of standing order  401  might be overridden completely. I am not putting that forward merely as an argument to show that the President's ruling is correct, but I am inviting the attention of honorable senators to u possibility that might occur. There is another point to which I may refer. It has been asked whether a question and an answer in the Senate amount to "debate.'' Let me invite honorable senators to consider this position : Let us assume that at the end of a sitting of the Senate, a Minister moves, " That the Senate do now adjourn," and that upon that motion an honorable senator rises and puts a question. Suppose that the Minister simply replies that he has no information upon the subject, but that if the honorable senator will ask the question again in a formal way at the next sitting, he will supply an answer. Suppose that the Senate then adjourns. Those proceedings, will be entered up in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Sennte. It will be stated that the Vice-President of the Executive Council moved the adjournment of the Senate, and that " debate ensued." </para>

                            <para>-  It goes down in our proceedings as " debate ensued." I notice that the clerical officers of the Senate are very accurate in their entries as to time. If a Minister moves, " That the Senate do now adjourn" at  9.30,  a senator asks  a  question, and the Minister answers him the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> will record that " debate ensued," and that the Senate adjourned at, say,  9.31.  So that a question and an answer under those circumstances are regarded as " debate." If our Standing Orders do not meet existing conditions, we must amend them; but we cannot call a question " debate " for one purpose, and not " debate " for another. </para>

I am not objecting to newspaper comments, or to the quotation of them, but I do direct attention to the fact that the settlemen of the question raised by the ruling of the  President  is not quite so easy a matter as it would seem at first sight. I am inclined to think that the intention of the standing order was to exclude the reading of newspaper comments, not because it was thought they might be disrespectful, or anything of" that kind, but in order to prevent honorable senators taking up the time of the Senate by quotations from outside sources when they should be called upon to contribute from the fund of their own information andintelligence. </para>

The simpler the form in which they are expressed, the better tor us all. Every honorable senator giving a vote on the motion will be guided by his own interpretation of the meaning of the word "debate." We can only arrive at a correct interpretation of the word by considering standing order  409  in conjunction with standing order  97.

                            <para>-  Yes, those words are commonly used when honorable senators are called to order for expressing opinions in putting questions. It has been ruled by you, sir, and by other Presidents before you, that questions must be put without inferences, opinions, or argument. Standing order  97  being so explicit on the point, I am at a loss to understand how any one can confuse the meaning of the word " question," as used in that standing order, with the meaning of the word " debate," as used in standing order  409.  I cannot see how the answering of a question can be regarded as debate. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> was allowed to proceed with the reading of them, the extracts he proposed to quote deal with the reply made by the Minister of Defence to the questions he had put. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that the Standing Orders require some alteration, and they should be considered by the Standing Orders Committee. Probably some modification of it can be suggested which would conduce to the better conduct of the business of the Senate- I was very much disposed, at first sight, to agree with your ruling, but it seems to me that we must deal with the standing order as it i before us, and that being so, I must uphold my own interpretation of the word " debate " as differentiated from the word " question." I shall have no hesitation, in the circumstances, in voting on the motion now before the Senate, because I contend that we must' deal with the standing order as it is before us. </para>

There is no analogy between that position and the one in which an honorable senator is strictly confined to the bare facts in any question which he desires to ask of a Minister. It seems clear to rae that very great danger might arise if the ruling were upheld and we decided that a "question" is a "debate." For instance, an honorable senator might inform another that he intended to bring forward an important matter. The latter might ask a question in regard to that matter, and if he did so, and your ruling were upheld, however important the statement the firSt honorable senator intended to make, the fact that the second had asked a question on the subject and received an answer would be sufficient to prevent the first from bringing forward his business, inasmuch as under your ruling a " debate v would already have taken place.

It is a fact that on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate any .honorable senator may debate a question ; but that is not sufficient to make it clear that a question and the answer to it, in the ordinary form, constitutes a " debate," as we understand it. It will be admitted that in the practice of the Senate we draw a clear distinction between a question and answer and a debate. The <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline> draw a distinction between the two. If we wish to 'know what went on in the Senate, we refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Journals,</inline> and they give us no more than that information. If we wish to know anything that occurred during a debate, or to gain some idea of its value, we cannot learn that from the <inline font-style="italic">Journals,</inline> we must look for it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> may contain a little more. Except as a technicality, I do not think that the contention so cleverly urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will weigh with honorable senators.

                            <para>-  It appears to me that the object of the standing order on which the  President  has based his ruling is to prevent honorable senators" reading newspaper extracts bearing On debates which have taken place in the Senate. I say that an answer by a Minister to a question put to him may afford as -much food for newspaper comment as may a debate upon the same subject which occupied the whole evening. The salient points in the policy of a- Government might be outlined in a Ministerial reply. To' that extent it seems to- me that there is very little to choose between questions and answers on -the one hand., and ordinary debate on the other, irrespective of whether or not our standing order relates to the former. ' It does not seem to me that Senators O'Keefe and Henderson have made out a conclusive case. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes. Usually questions and answers constitute a very one-sided form of debate, because while an honorable senator is rigidly confined to matters of fact, the Minister in replying is allowed much greater latitude. I repeat that very much debatable matter may be conveyed in the form of a Ministerial answer, and consequently there is no reason why our standing order should not apply to questions and answers as well as to debate. From the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> it appears that this standing order had its origin in ancient days when it was regarded as a breach of privilege to comment upon anything which Parliament did. If it serves no other purpose it would be more in accordance with up-to-date methods if it were swept away. We all know that by reading newspaper comments upon answers to questions an honorable senator might get in the major portion of a speech, which otherwise he would not be permitted to deliver. I admit that the speeches of some honorable senators, if they were read, would be much more eloquent than they are. Upon the whole it seems to me that in considering this standing order it would be in the interests of the freedom of honorable senators if the widest possible interpretation were placed upon it. You, sir, have erred by putting the narrowest construction upon it. Therefore, upon the principal that we should extend to the accused the benefit of any doubt which may exist, I feel inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline></para>

Nearly every honorable senator who has- spoken has expressed a doubt as to the way in which he should vote.

                            <para>-  The matter was not put in that way. The fact that we have power to suspend a standing order which curtails our liberty in any way, is another strong reason why we should support the  President  in the position which he has taken up. I listened attentively to the statements made by eminent constitutional authorities like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> I cannot very well couple <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> with them, because we should then have too much talent arrayed on one side. What is the position ? At the present time a question relating to defence may be asked of a Minister, and a reply may be given to it. Upon that question and reply the newspapers may write articles and publish letters bearing upon the whole military policy of the country. A similar remark is applicable to questions relating to quarantine, old-age pensions, land taxation, or, indeed, any other subject. If such articles were at the command of honorable senators, and could be utilized by them in debate, would not the position be just as bad as if those articles were written upon a matter which had been the subject of debate in the Senate? I intend to support the ruling of the President* who is charged with maintaining order and upholding the privileges of the Senate. If our Standing Orders are ambiguous, I am sure that if a request be made to the Standing Orders Committee, that body will remove the ambiguity or frame a new Standing Order. </para>

                    <para>The whole question, it will be seen, hangs upon the one word " debate." You, sir, have ruled that the mere asking and answering of a question in this Senate constitutes debate. We who do not claim to be experts in the language which we speak have, therefore, to turn to authorities to ascertain the real meaning of " debate." According to the newest edition of <inline font-style="italic">Webster,</inline> page 575, the first meaning of " debate " is "to engage in strife, or combat, to fight, contend, quarrel." Now, the mere asking and answering of a question cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be held to be a fight, nor can it be termed "engaging in a quarrel." The second meaning given to the term is "to contend in words, to dispute; hence, to deliberate; to consider ; to discuss or examine different arguments in the mind." Now, under our Standing Orders, an honorable senator cannot engage in argument when asking a question. In other words, questions and replies to -them must relate to matters of fact. <inline font-style="italic">Webster</inline> goes on to give various examples of the meaning of the term' " debate." For instance, in regard to the definition " to strive or fight," he quotes from <inline font-style="italic">Prescott</inline> that - </para>

The impossible may happen at any time, and under any circumstances, if people are not reasonable.

                            <para>- In the interest of the privileges of the Senate it is good that a" matter of this description should come up for consideration. I do not think that an apology is ever needed from an honorable senator who disagrees with a ruling, for the simple reason that, while the Chair does its best to carry out what it thinks is the intention of the Standing Orders, and to conserve as far as possible the rights and privileges of the Senate, it is liable at all times to make a mistake. If a majority of honorable senators think that a mistake has been made by the Chair, it is their duty to vote in such a way as to retain what they consider to be the privileges or the rights of senators. I was, and still am, under the impression that standing order 409 is not so clear as honorable senators seem to imagine it to be. In the first place, it opens up a very wide opportunity for quoting from newspapers or documents in connexion with questions which may have been asked' to elicit information, and the replies which may have been given by a Minister, and given very extensively, so as to satisfy the seeker for information. I find that in his effort to give as much information as he could to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> the answer of the Minister of Defence covered four and a-half columns of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That answer would afford room for a. considerable amount of discussion in the press. On the motion for adjournment, or at any other time when the matter came up for discussion an honorable senator would be able to read the opinions of newspapers, perhaps in different States, regarding the matter, while the Chair would not be able to say that he was reading his speech, because he could interpolate certain remarks. So long as it applied only to questions which had been asked and answered, the reading of extracts from newspapers or documents would be in order. I know that the strict limitation of the standing order applies to .debate. But I was endeavouring to give effect to what I  thought was the intention of the standing order. Honorable senators may think that my ruling would restrict, to some extent, the reading of quotations from newspapers. That is quite right. That was, I think, the intention of the standing order, but it was not the intention of the Chair to try to limit debate in any way, where honorable senators had quoted questions from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and were supplying their own comments on those questions. I realize that it may, perhaps, in one direction, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> be the means of a considerable amount of restriction. I recognise that if a question could be asked to-day, and by that means a debate on that matter later could be burked, it would be a very great inconvenience, and restrict the rights and liberties of honorable senators. I am very glad that this discussion has arisen. I hope that if honorable senators think that my ruling would be restrictive of their rights, they will have no hesitation in voting that it was a wrong interpretation of the standing order, and then it will be for the Standing Orders Committee to see that the rule is made clearer, and that the rights and privileges of the Senate are preserved. </para>

                            <para>-  I hope, sir, that honorable senators will take a stand on this matter, as you have invited them to do. I am very much afraid that your reply may have clouded the issue. It is not a question as to whether your interpretation of the standing order is right or wrong, or whether the Standing Orders Committee should make another rule, but whether honorable senators can be considered to have entered into a debate merely because a Minister has been asked a question and has replied. We have to determine the meaning of standing order 409. You, sir, have given a decision that, under that rule, if a question has been asked and answered, that is a debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> asked the Minister of Defence a question without notice, and the Minister's reply occupies four columns of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard ;</inline> but there was no chance to debate the question, and we would have been ruled out of order if we had attempted to do so. Senators Keating and Symon have said that if, on the motion for adjournment, an honorable senator puts a question to a Minister, debate ensues. I am well aware that on that motion we can debate anything; but if an honorable senator rises at the beginning of a sitting, he can only ask a question of a Minister, and get the stereotyped reply, and the  President  will not permit either the honorable senator or the Minister in reply to debate the matter. Whilst I admit that, perhaps, it would be wise for the Standing Orders Committee to amend standing order 409, we ought to determine now whether your ruling is right or wrong. I sincerely hope that the Senate will carry my motion. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to read the extract now. I have something else to say. It was my intention to read the quotation, because it deals with the manning of the forts.. It shows better than I could possibly show the reason why this officer should have been left in the position which he held. I have tried to point out to the Senate that an injustice has been done. No better tribute could be' paid to the qualities of that officer than the fact that hundreds of men who had served under him for years were willing to lay down their tools of battle as a protest against the injustice done to him. I think it is unfair for anybody to say that the officer has attempted to influence the men in one way or the other. Some of the proposals of the military authorities in reference to the manning of this fort are farcical. They have reinforced these companies by youths from the Cadet Forces, and brought in a regulation that they are to be taken into the Australian Garrison Artillery because of the districts in which they live. We see lads of 5 feet nothing and 5 ft. 1 in. drafted into these regiments. Will any one say that these lads are fit to tackle 100-lb. shells at the rate of twelve a minute? At the same time, we find youths of 6 feet and 5 ft. 6 in. drafted into the field regiments, where they have not heavy work to do. There is a certain amount of discontent with the administration of the Defence Act, and the discontent is growing. So long as we try to put these little disabilities on our young soldiers that discontent will grow so far that those who created the system of compulsory training will surely regret it. The .Minister of Defence should try to administer the Act in a way which will make the young men feel that they are doing work for the love of their country, and that there is no desire on the part of the Government or the officers to harass them in any way. We hear of this discontent from one end of the country to the other. Only yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Rutter, the secretary of the Trades Hall, told me that he willingly gave his lad up to the training, but that the officers had absolutely made a wreck of him. </para>

                            <para>- I had no desire to transgress any rule, but I thought that I was leading up to the very matter which I wanted to discuss. I was speaking of the discontent in our Military Forces and in the Cadet Forces. That is the reason why I moved the adjournment of the Senate to-day, and that is why the Australian Garrison Artillery took the step which they did. I ask that an impartial inquiry be held, when evidence could be obtained from all sides, and the militia officers would be able to state their case. That is, I think, a. just and fair request. .My desire is to see matters proceed smoothly ; but, unless this feeling of discontent is allayed, it will grow until drastic action will have to be taken. We have been told by an officer, in one of the replies given by the Minister, that there is no comparison between the Permanent Forces - that is, the Royal Australian Artillery and the Australian Garrison Artillery. In other words, he means, " They will never be like us." The social caste which is rising between the militia and the permanent officers is, to a great extent, the cause of the present trouble. It is a feeling which we ought to break down, and break down with a firm hand. The officer who has been deposed from his position does not belong to the military caste. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it is to be regretted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> in bringing this matter forward to-day, resorted to reflections of a personal character, based largely on street-corner gossip and tittle-tattle of which he has, and can have, no personal knowledge. This was obviously done out of personal ill-feeling to myself. The statements he made had absolutely nothing to do with the matter at issue. They had regard to my own qualities of personal courage and of intelligence, and the motives which actuated me in taking the action I have done regarding this matter. I say that it is regrettable that the honorable senator could not ventilate a subject of this kind without descending to such tactics. I do not propose to reply to them, but shall treat them with the contempt they deserve. Coming to the question itself, and endeavouring to separate it from the things which had nothing to do with it -  the honorable senator 'Started off by making three charges which, he said, he proposed to substantiate. The first was that I, or some one else - he did not specify whom - has thrown dust in the eyes 'of the people. The second was that certain reports - he did not specify which - were altered. The third was that matters have been introduced to distract attention. As to the first charge, of which no proof was produced, if the honorable senator refers to statements made by myself in the Senate last week, I have only to say this: I have no personal feeling in this matter whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chaseling.</inline> the officer to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> referred, was an entire stranger to me until I met him. at the dinner of which honorable senators have heard. I had never seen him before, and there was no personal feeling in my mind regarding him. There would be no object in "throwing dust in the eyes of the people." Obviously, it "would have been very much easier for me to do what the honorable senator has been asking me to do. By taking that course, I should have earned his good-will and escaped his criticism ; whereas, by taking the course which seemed to me to be the right one, I have apparently drawn upon myself his ill-will, as well as his opposition. As regards the alleged suppression of reports, I have to say that I read to the Senate last week the full report forwarded to me by the Staff Officer for Artillery, New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Osborne.</inline> I made no attempt to suppress any portion of it. The honorable senator himself to-day quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a portion of it. The report is before him now. I ask the honorable senator - I challenge him - to point to any portion of it to show that I have either supressed or altered it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator spoke as if there were a number of reports. This report was from the Commandant of the Garrison Artillery, and in it he epitomizes the reports from various officers commanding in the forts. That report, I say again, I quoted in full. As to reports having been altered, I have to say that the report which I quoted came to me through the proper channel, and it bears the original signatures of the officers through, whose hands it passed. First, it bears the signature of the officer who penned it, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Osborne.</inline> It bears the stamp of the New South Wales District Commandant's office. It shows that it was forwarded by the District Commandant, and has his signature upon it. It is also signed by  Colonel Wallace,  and bears the stamp of his office. To say that a report of that kind has beer* altered is simply to make a . reckless charge without backing it up by a tittle of evidence. I say that it is unworthy of any honorable senator to do that, unless he has something: more than vague suspicion to support his statements. </para>

As I mentioned, it is signed by the name and title of the officer who furnished it. It indicates that that officer was giving an epitome of the reports of company officers. I can show that by indicating paragraphs in it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I can make a comparison. In 3rd Company, Newcastle, there were twenty retirements; they have all been withdrawn. In 5th Company, Sydney and Wollongong, forty retirements were put down, but there is no statement as to how many have been withdrawn so far as Sydney is concerned. As I have already stated, none of the Wollongong men resigned. In the 4th Company, Sydney, there were eighty retirements of men, and three of officers. </para>

                            <para>- But it has to be remembered that since the order with reference to camp has been altered, the two Sydney companies have not had an opportunity of considering whether they will continue to serve under the amended conditions. I was dealing with the reasons for these resignations. T say, as I said last week, that one of the chief reasons was the alteration in the number of days for which the men were called upon to attend camp. When we remember that these men are for the most part working men, it is obvious that the change from eight to seventeen days' camp caused a liability of their not being able to remain so long away from their industrial occupations. </para>

                            <para>- Usually at Easter time. Another cause, which I gave last week, and which I repeat now - because it is given to me not only by permanent officers, but by citizen officers as well - is the abolition of the canteen. I say with regret that some resignations have been caused by reason of that change, as well as on account of the regulation regarding cigarette smoking in camp. </para>

                            <para>- Because, it has to be remembered that the militia and the trainees are in camp together, and that you cannot have two sets of regulations working side by side. If you have a regulation of this kind applying to the trainees, it must also apply to the militia. But the reports that I have received on that point show that the dissatisfaction regarding cigarette smoking is not anything like so strong as it is in regard to the abolition of the canteen. Those are the two most important points. As regards the question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> appears to think is the chief cause for these resignations - namely, the abolition of the regimental staff - I have here an extract . from the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners Advocate,</inline> of Wednesday, 31st July, The whole gist of it is to show that, so far as the Newcastle men were concerned, the sole cause of complaint was the extension of the days of training. They were not concerned about the abolition of the regimental staff. That is a statement which was made by a militia officer, Captain Robb, and not by a permanent officer. </para>

                            <para>- No; a statement made by Captain Robb to the representative of a newspaper. The Newcastle men were not in the least concerned about the abolition of the regimental staff. I propose to give the Senate the benefit of the advice by which I was guided in adopting the proposals not merely as regards Sydney, and certainly not with any regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chaseling,"</inline> who is a complete stranger to me, but because the principles set forth seem to me to be sound. The proposed change had been put into force in Victoria over six months before;, it was in actual operation at the last camp, and officers and men accepted it without question or demur. </para>

                        <para>Misapprehension appears to exist as to the reasons for the reorganization which is taking place in the Australian Garrison Artillery. This reorganization, however, is being effected in order to make war efficiency the basis of all our peace arrangements; it is not by any means an attempt to cast a slur upon the qualifications of the Citizen Forces officers, of whose services there is no lack of appreciation at Military Head-  quarters. Hitherto the peace organization of the Australian Garrison Artillery has not been based upon any definite estimate of war requirements. Consequent upon Lord Kitchener's recommendation this defect is now being remedied. </para>

                    <para>The first step necessary was the appointment of Commanders of Coast Defences, who would be responsible for the training and efficiency of all the Artillery and Engineer Units allotted to the respective districts over which they were given control. Such officers were originally the Staff Officers for Artillery of respective Military Commandants, and had practically the same responsibility as regards the training and efficiency of Artillery and Engineer units. But, in addition to them, however, there existed a Regimental Staff of the Australian Garrison Artillery. For the maintenance of such a Staff there was not then, and there is certainly not now, any justification. A Lieutenant-Colonel's Command in Garrison Artillery comprises the command of a certain number of batteries to which  a  certain number of companies are allotted at a defended port. In other words, it constitutes a Fire Command. Lord Kitchener recommended that the first relief of all the guns of the . fixed defences of Australia should be provided from Permanent Units, and that the Australian Garrison Artillery should be so organized as to provide a second relief. Funds have not so far been available to comply fully with these recommendations, and a certain number of men of the Australian Garrison Artillery are still required to complete first relief. </para>
                    <para>To provide a Regimental Staff for the necessary Australian Garrison Artillery Companies, however, means an additional cog in the administrative wheel, and it may so happen that such a Staff would be redundant to the requirements of the Artillery Manning Tables. A Lieutenant-Colonel's Command in Artillery depends on the needs of such a Manning Table, and not on the wish of companies to have their peace command and administration provided for by the appointment of a Regimental Staff. </para>
                    <para>Positions as Fire Commanders are still open to officers of the Australian Garrison Artillery who prove themselves qualified to hold them. </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains that the positions of company commander and fire commander will still be open to militia officers. But it is obvious that when we have to put the command of a fortress, as a whole, under a permanent officer who has a staff, as they all have, it would be a mere duplication to provide a fifth wheel for the coach in the shape of a regimental staff of militia, merely because some of the men required to man the forts belong to the militia. The abolition of militia fortress commanders rendered it necessary, if we were to be logical and consistent, to abolish the attached regimental staffs. The position of fortress commander, on the best advice we could get - that of Lord Kitchener - should be in the hands of a permanent man. Although! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chaseling</inline> lives just alongside the barracks, that has nothing to do with the matter.. The difference between the two men is that one is an officer always under orders, and whose duties take him in and out of the fortress and amongst the men, and the other is an officer who gives to the business only the time he can spare from his ordinary avocations. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chaseling</inline> lived just alongside the barracks. The point, however, is that we require in such a position a permanent officer, who is always under orders, rather than a man who merely puts in his spare time at the work. Honorable senators must see that if they do not object to the fortress commander being a permanent man, they admit that the necessity for the regimental staff is gone. I am not a soldier. I have said that before, and I say it again. I have to be guided on matters such as this by the expert advice provided for me by the country. I know that there is always a tendency on the part of permanent officers - perhaps I had better say an unconscious bias - leading them to depreciate militia officers. The Minister of Defence has to be on his guard to see that that is not done. </para>

                            <para>- I can, and I am prepared to accept it. Having for such reasons decided not to turn down these propositions, I certainly cannot do so because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> chooses to treat it as a personal matter, and to make attacks upon me. I have already disclaimed any desire whatever to injure <inline font-weight="bold">Major Chaseling.</inline> I have no personal feeling towards him. If anything, mv wish woulcl be to give him the benefit of the doubt if there were one. But after full investigation of the matter, it seems to me that those who have submitted these propositions for the abolition of the regimental staff have submitted unanswerable arguments in their favour. They have also proved that what they did in Victoria under precisely similar conditions was accepted without a murmur, and that the results of the change have been satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- It is not only that, but it is hacked up by the results obtained at the last camp of training. In view of these facts, I say that it is unwise to try, by bringing political pressure to bear, to achieve in that way what could not be achieved on the merits of the question. I venture to say that any person who dealt with the matter on its merits could come to only one conclusion. We have to remember that to-day a fortress is practically an arsenal of highly technical machinery. Our fortresses are armed with up-to-date guns, magazines, and all the necessary paraphernalia. I have been taunted because effect has not been given to Lord Kitchener's recommendation with respect to the second relief. </para>

It is recognised that with the time they are able to give to the work, militia men cannot expect to reach the qualification demanded from a permanent man. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that we have not carried out the recommendation as to the second relief, but there is an obvious reason for it which honorable senators can discover for themselves if they scan the Estimates for this year. When they see that we propose an expenditure of £5,500,000, I need not give them any other reason than to say that to fulfil the recommendation referred to, we should have to double the expenditure - for that is what it means - on our Permanent Forces to-day. We are, however, doing something to meet the difficulty. We recognise that the great difficulty in time of war woulcl be to provide a sufficient number of noncommissioned permanent officers and specialists in certain lines. We are providing in the Estimates for a certain additional number of such officers, and also to complete the first relief for the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery. That is the best we can do with the money at our disposal this year.- </para>

                        will have an opportunity when the Estimates are being considered to resume his attack upon the Government. He may blame us for not having gone further, but I think that honorable senators who consider the amount of money proposed to be expended on Defence will be of opinion that we have gone far enough.

                        <para>. - There is one matter upon which I desire to say a few words. I am not sufficiently familiar with the details of this question to attempt to take any serious part in its discussion. I merely wish to direct attention to a probable reconciliation between the very grave statements made by Senator McDougall and the reply given by the Minister this afternoon in regard to the accuracy of the report which the Minister read last week. I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> to affirm that that report was inaccurate in three particulars. He declared that certain matter had been suppressed, that other matter had been altered, and that certain other matter not in the original reports had been introduced. These are very definite and very serious charges. The Minister appears to take the accusation of the honorable senator as one directed against himself. But it will be recollected that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> was speaking,  1  asked him who was responsible for that suppression, and that, with a deliberation for which he is not always remarkable, he gave me my choice. He said that I could please myself as to whether I thought it was the Minister of Defence, or whether I believed that the offence had been committed by somebody else before the papers found their way into the Minister's hands. This afternoon, in reply to a question put by me, the Minister admitted that the report which' he was reading was an epitome- </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> appears lately to have taken up this position : that what he says must not be challenged - that the utterances of the great Minister of Defence must not be criticised by anybody. Whenever any matter 'connected with his Department has come under review in this Chamber, he has invariably lost his temper. So far as I am concerned, he may go on losing it. I will help him to find it. In this case, it appears to me that there is a very reasonable explanation of the wide divergence between the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and that of the Minister. It seems possible that some person, quite innocently, in endeavouring to epitomize die reports of several officers, has not accurately . given us the purport of these reports. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has stated that one report is entirely missing. </para>

                            <para>- They are always sufficiently strong to carry the day against our citizen officers. I say that our Citizen Forces will be demoralized if the Minister allows himself to be dominated too much by his permanent officers. I do not dispute the fact that the permanent officer should, generally speaking, be a better adviser than should the citizen soldier. But it seems to me that if we lay down the position that the permanent officers, without adequate Ministerial check, are to be permitted to differentiate in favour of the permanent men, as against our citizen soldiers, we shall publish throughout Australia that the only men who need bother about admission to our citizen army are those who are destitute of any ambition to rise in the service of their country. </para>

It seems to me that he attempted to badger the Minister, and endeavoured to twist his statements into admissions wrung from him against his will. I do not think that is a. fair way of debating this question. I do not agree with a good deal that the Minister does ; but I recognise that he occupies the most difficult position in the Ministry. It seems to me that if there be any way out of this "trouble, it will be by the creation of some kind of civilian board of advice, which may be able to curb the pretensions and arrogant spirit which animate the military Johnnies. </para>

                            <para>- It is merely a difference of opinion, and I have as much right to set my own standard of courtesy as I have to accept that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. The term ' ' military Johnnies ' ' - even if it be not contained in <inline font-style="italic">Webster</inline> - is better understood than are a good many words which  are to be found there. I think we can justly say that there is a military caste who, unless we continually fight them, will, as they have done in other parts of the world, attempt to secure dominance, and trample civilian rights under their feet. In that respect I agree with all that has been said to-day. I think that the Minister is in an unfortunate position. While he states that he must accept the views put forward by his responsible military officers, unless there are the strongest possible reasons for turning them down, he has ignored the possibility that under that state of affairs, to which he feels himself committed, he is in danger of being a mere puppet in their hands, because, if there is no outside body whom he would recognise as capable of supplying authentic information in the direction of putting the other side of the question, or various questions which arise, then whatever strong reasons exist may never be formulated or placed before him. It appears that all the time we are in the unfortunate position of having to accept practically military domination by the mere fact of not having any recognised authority which could put forward the civilian aspect of matters. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the Minister does not seem to understand the point I am trying to drive home, though that may be owing to my want of lucidity. It is that while an aggrieved person or a company serving under an aggrieved officer, or one who thinks that he has been injured, may be able to put one side of the question, there is no authoritative body other than those who are dissatisfied to represent them, and give what may be termed something like authoritative expression to their views? We cannot listen to the man in the street or to the public-house rumour. Who is there to give authentic information in order to place the position as strongly in one direction as the high military officials can put it in the other? This has raised a question which seems to me to invite the Parliament to seriously consider the advisability of having a civil power which would be able to safeguard the interests of, not merely the militia, but the general public, against the strong views which can be expressed by the Military Board on matters in which civilian interests have no representation. We never can be certain of getting justice in such a case as the one on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has based this motion for adjournment, where we ha%'e the prejudices, and general outlook, of the permanent military officers in active hostility to the views of the other side, because the latter only speak when they are personally aggrieved, and everything which they say is therefore - and more or less properly so - liable to be discounted. We want some board or body to speak with the same authority on behalf of the nonpermanent men and the general public as those who now speak on behalf of the permanent men, and for that reason seem to get the ear of the Minister much more readily. Furthermore, if I am not straying beyond the terms of the motion, the reason given by I he Minister for not carrying out certain recommendations, namely;, that it would involve an enormous additional cost, may be perfectly sound, but if, as he states, between ,£5,000,000 and £6,000,000 is to be expended on defence this year, we ought to have a very much more reliable guidance than can come on the one hand from the Minister, who confesses that he has no technical knowledge, or on the other hand from his officers, who have no responsibility. Here, according to the Minister's own statement, all the professional knowledge rests with the permanent officers, whilst they, as the nucleus of a military caste, are interested in the growth and increased importance of the Defence Forces on the one hand, and he has to take their reports and accept their recommendations on the other. </para>

I do not want to see any Board established outside the Minister of Defence. I was rather astonished at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> first accusing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> of twisting the Minister's statement, and then going at any length to twist what he said in regard to the advice he took from his expert officers- I understood the Minister quite clearly to say that, unless the reasons given to the contrary were sufficiently strong, he could not turn down their advice, and not that he was not acquainted with what was going on. Although there were no reasons sufficiently strong to induce the Minister to avoid these difficulties, yet, in' view of what' has. since transpired, there, must have: been very serious reasons indeed why 140 reasoning and reasonable beings - ordinary citizens - handed in their resignations. That is not a thing which is likely to be done at the beck or call of any officer. </para>

                            <para>- I think that it was one of the causes. I take it that the decision to which this large body of reputable men came would not have been arrived at unless they had a number of serious grievances. A discussion of this kind will clear the air to some extent but what is likely to be the result ? Is anything to be done to put the regiment back on its old footing? Is anything to be done to restore the confidence of each man, which must have been severely shaken before he took the serious step of handing in his resignation. I contend that some action should be taken. No doubt, when a change is made, there will always be a number of dissatisfied persons. The Minister relied largely upon the fact that when the change was made in Victoria there was no friction; but it seems to me that the conditions obtaining in Victoria were not identical with the conditions in New South Wales. There was no one here, perhaps, sufficiently interested in the change to take any action. The fact that the men in Sydney resigned satisfies me that they take a deep interest in all that is happening to their country. I prefer a class of men who are not prepared to take every order or regulation as a mere matter of military discipline - to swallow it and say no more about it, no matter how distasteful it may be to them. To my mind, the resignation of these men at Sydney is the most serious matter which has yet confronted the Defence Department. Not only has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> been aware for months of the existence of this dissatisfaction, but he has been endeavouring to prevent the dislocation which has taken place. I deeply regret that the permanent officers and men have not been able to get . in touch and sympathy with the partially-paid men or militia, because, serious as is this matter at present, it may become more serious still. No matter what advice may have been given to the Minister, there has been good and ample reasons brought forward for holding a full inquiry - not one which will be confined to the mere question of whether these men object to a regulation, but one which will elicit information as to whether there was really anything to justify the serious step which they have taken. I belive that, if an impartial inquiry is made, it will give the aggrieved persons an opportunity, not only to put their grievances before the Minister, but also to put themselves right before the general public. It is, I think, almost an unheard of thing for soldiers to resign in a body because of any regulation or order. That is a great deal worse than men going on strike. We may take it for granted that, whenever men take that attitude, there is something very wrong. This matter should not be allowed to rest where it is, but an opportunity should be afforded to the men to state their case in such a way as not only to justify their action, but also to justify themselves in the eyes of the public. I think that a full inquiry, right down to bed-rock, should be ordered by the Minister. If it is inconvenient to the military people, they may set their backs up against an inquiry into what they have done. If a full inquiry is ordered, it will be an intimation to military officers that if they subject any section of the Defence Forces to conditions which are considered unfair, the Government and Parliament will see that any legitimate grievance is investigated. </para>

                            <para>- That is one of the difficulties that we are " up against." If there are regulations which prevent this Parliament, representing the people, from doing what it thinks it ought to do, there is a simple if rough method of dealing with the matter. That is to say, Parliament can refuse to vote any funds for building up a 'military system that will eventually, if we continue it as at present, cause even greater dissatisfaction. The method that I would adopt would be to refuse to vote any more money for military purposes. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to disabuse the mind of the Minister of the idea that I have any personal feeling in this matter- 1 have none whatever. What is more, he has my sympathy. I approached the Minister months ago, knowing what the result would be if the grievances of the men were not attended to. Is there, any honorable senator who would not think that he had been ignored if, when he asked for an interview with a Minister, it was not granted, his letter not even being answered ? But, nevertheless, I did not take umbrage. These men waited on me as soon as the order for the abolition of the staff was given. They, asked me to interview the Minister and try to dissuade him from carrying out his intention. They told me that every man in the regiment was prepared to resign, out of loyalty to the best commander they ever had. I said to the men, " Do not do that.. That is a threat. Do not threaten the Minister or the authorities. I will do what I can, and I honestly believe that something will be done to find a way out of this very disagreeable situation." I asked them to postpone taking action for twelve months. But the order had gone forth. I do. not blame the Minister for ' being firm if he thinks that a thing has to be done. But if he could back down in regard to the regulation as to the period of camp training, why could he not do so in regard to the abolition of the regimental staff ? I have done my level best to bring about a good understanding. I believe in the citizen soldier. The regulations which are being put forth are not in accordance with the letter of our Defence Act. In many cases they distort the Act, and are out of harmony with the feeling of Parliament. Under the present regulations it is impossible for a citizen soldier to rise to the highest position in his regiment. Men have said to me that they had only five months to serve to earn their long-service medal.. Others had a year or two 3'ears to serve.. To earn this medal is the dearest thing in life to some men who are keen on soldiering. But they were prepared to deny themselves the opportunity of earning this honour in order to resent what they regarded as unjust treatment. When that occurs, we know that there is something wrong. Trouble is bound to arise when such a spirit exists as is indicated in the report of one of these officers, who says, " The Australian Garrison Artillery can never compare with us !" </para>

                            <para>- I cannot find it just now, but it is there, almost in the very words that I have used. I will show it to the Minister afterwards. I consider that if I did not raise my voice in the interests of these men, I should be to blame I do not care who is Minister of Defence, or what Government is in office; if I had to give a vote against this Government for oppressing the citizen soldiery, I would do so, and not be frightened about it. It has to be remembered that I have approached the Prime Minister on this matter, and asked for his assistance. I pointed out to him the trouble that was arising. But I got no sympathy ; and because I raise my voice on the floor of the Senate, the Minister says that I have personal feeling against him. I have no such feeling. But I regret the feeling of caste that is arising in connexion with the Military Forces, and I say that if the military authorities will not grapple with it Parliament must, or there will be serious trouble in future. All that I ask for now is a full and impartial inquiry. I want the citizen officer to be heard in his own defence. The report read by the Minister was inaccurate and misleading. I do not say that the Minister himself was inaccurate, but that the report furnished to him was. It says that a certain officer commands a certain company, which he does not command. The actual commander of that company assures me that he furnished a report, and that report has not been given to us. There is something wrong about that. I heard one of the officers say that the Minister was once a private in his regiment, and that he felt proud of him, but I understand that the Minister was never a soldier in his life. These officers have no sympathy with the Minister, and will be glad to get rid of him. This military business is altogether too severe on our young Australians, and they are not going to stand it. The Australian is pushed on one side to-day in favour of some one else. He is given no opportunity to rise. The boy who is prepared to give his life for the defence of his country has no chance of rising to one of the highest positions in the Citizen Forces. In the Artillery it is impossible for an officer to rise above the rank of battery commander. That is not fair to the officers, and I raise my voice against such treatment. Let us have a full, fair, and impartial inquiry, and I will stand by all that I have said. </para>

The narrative will convince honorable senators that there is a conflict between the clearly expressed intention of Parliament and regulation 27 under the Commonwealth Bank Act, to which the motion alludes. On 7th December, 191 1, the Commonwealth Bank Bill was received by the Senate from the House of Representatives. It contained the following clause, No. <inline font-style="italic">48 -</inline></para>

So far as this Parliament had legislated upon the matter the bank was not relieved of its responsibility under the circumstances indicated in the clause which appeared in the Bill when it came up to the Senate. The intention of Parliament clearly was that depositors should be protected against anything in the form of ne
