        It is also pleasing to know that this motion will have strong bipartisan support. I am sure that that will earn the gratitude of the many thousands of people who are associated with the wool industry throughout Australia. My electorate of Parkes, which takes in 40 per cent of New South Wales, contains a great number of sheep farmers, and it contains some of the oldest and most famous sheep studs in Australia. I grew up on a sheep property and, as a farmer-grazier and a veterinarian, I have been associated with the wool industry all my life.

        At a time like this, it is interesting to look back on the rather modest origins of our wool industry. The first sheep that set foot in Australia came out with the First Fleet in 1788. Governor Phillip had obtained them from the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. Those sheep, known as Cape fat tails, had fat tails—as their name implies—and hairy fleece. They were raised more for their meat than for their wool.

        However, what is not so well known is that the merino, which rapidly took Australia to the position of the world's leading wool producer, also came from South Africa at the end of the 18th century. Chance played a large role here as the Dutch Cape Colony had not long passed to British rule. Two ships which had sailed from Sydney to Cape Town in 1797 to buy cattle and other supplies ended up purchasing a small flock of Spanish merinos, which were descended from a gift of sheep given by the King of Spain to the Dutch government.

        Mrs Gordon, widow of the Scot who had governed the Cape on behalf of the Dutch East India Company, was disposing of the sheep. Captain Waterhouse and Captain Kent of the two supply ships from Australia bought 13 of these sheep at a cost of $8.40 a head. Rarely, if ever, has a better purchase and investment been made in the history of the world.

         Reliance
        </emphasis>
        , survived and he sold them to landowners in the colony, including officers in the New South Wales Corps. Among these were Captain John Macarthur, the Reverend Samuel Marsden, William Cox and Captain Rowley, all of whom were to become pioneers in the Australian merino breeding industry.

        We all know the Macarthur success story which subsequently unfolded. He originally obtained four ewes and two rams believed to be of the escurial type, the finest wool strain owned by the Spanish royalty. Before this Macarthur had been breeding from 60 Bengal ewes and lambs he had bought in 1793 and later two Irish ewes and a young ram. Macarthur and his wife—I believe his wife deserves more recognition than she has had for the role she played—were both visionaries. He returned to England in 1803, when his flock totalled about 4,000, and persuaded the authorities there of the potential of our wool industry. In 1807 Macarthur delivered the first bale of wool from Australia to London, which he sold, incidentally, for $2.27 a kilogram. Quality rapidly improved and by 1822, which was a turning point in the Australian wool industry, Macarthur received two gold medals from the Society of Arts for importing wool as good as the finest Saxon wool. I remind honourable members that at that time Saxony and Silesia in Germany had taken over from Spain and were producing the best wool in the world.

        Australia was on the way. In 1821 we exported 80,000 kilograms of wool; in 1823 we exported 180,000 kilograms; in 1830 exports had climbed to half a million kilograms; 10 years later there was an eightfold increase to four million kilograms; and by 1844 we were exporting six million kilograms of wool. In recent years, of course, we have exported in excess of 1,000 million kilograms. By 1845 Australia had broken the back of the German wool industry, and some of the manufacturers there were even importing Australian wool. We were doing this not just by opening up more land; we were improving the quality of our wool here: the density, the length, the colour qualities, the micron measure, the yield and the cut per head. In 1800 the average purebred Spanish ewes cut less than two kilograms a head; today the average stud ewe cuts in excess of seven kilograms a head.

        Seventy-five per cent of Australia's 140 million to 150 million sheep—we have been up over 180 million in recent years—are merinos. We produce a third of the world's raw wool and half of the world's merino wool, but it is in the quality area that we really shine. We produce around 80 per cent of the world's apparel wool. We have been so successful at this because not only do we have the genetic material here but, even more importantly, we have the management expertise and the hard work of the 60,000 farmers that raise sheep in Australia. We also have the environment. We have cheap land relative to the rest of the world and we have a climate that is unmatched. If others try to grow this wool elsewhere they cannot do so, because either they have not got the environment or it is more profitable to produce something else, such as meat or grain.

        Today there are basically four strains of merinos in Australia. The Peppin strain is the most popular. It is a large-framed sheep which thrives in the drier inland regions of Australia. We have the South Australian merino, which is the largest strain—longer, taller, heavier and plainer—and is bred to thrive in the more arid pastoral areas. We have the Spanish merinos, which are directly descended from the Spanish flocks. They are soft handling and have a similar distribution to the Peppin strain. Then we have the Saxons, which tend to run in the high rainfall, cooler country of the tablelands in Tasmania. They have very fine, high quality wool.

        The tale of building our merino wool industry to the stage it is at today is the story of Australia itself. It is a story synonymous with our famous pioneering spirit. It is a story of hardship; it is a story of perseverance. It is a story of joy through boom; it is a story of despair through bust. It is a story of droughts, floods and fire, of high prices and low prices. It has inspired much of our literature and poetry. It has supported and boosted our economy as no other product we have seen before in this country has. It has been our number one export industry for more than a century and it has given us, all of us, a standard of living which is the envy of the world and which we would not otherwise have attained without this wonderful product.

        The wool industry, which has adapted in the past, is about to move into a new era. It will experience new and increased competition from cotton; it will experience new and increased competition from synthetics. I believe it is about to undergo a revamp of its marketing methods. It will survive this, and we will see in this country an expansion of the value adding industry in Australia.

        Recently, the world best practice wool processing plant, Austop, was set up in Parkes in my electorate. Roger Fletcher at the abattoir in Dubbo is producing in excess of 500 bales of fellmongered wool a week. He is about to set up his own scouring plant there. These are two examples of what is happening in this country. I believe the future for wool is as bright now as it was 200 years ago, and I believe the next 200 years of wool production in Australia will in many ways be just as successful as the 200 years that have gone before. I commend the motion to honourable members in this chamber.

        Many innovations have taken place since the decline and removal of the reserve price scheme for wool. The result of one such initiative was displayed in this parliament by the honourable member for O'Connor: a combination of artificial and wool fibres which provides excellent insulation and is made into products such as doonas. At the time, I recall, the then member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, was in the chair and took up the challenge of the honourable member for O'Connor. The two of them coopted a team which included the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and me and coordinated national wool day in 1992. This was a very spectacular day which included a wool auction. The only complaint about the wool auction was that, although some buyers were prepared to pay a good price to say they bought it here in Parliament House, other buyers were very upset that they had to bid higher and pay more than they would have paid in Newcastle. That may not happen again. We are talking about having a bigger day and a great display next year, in 1995, if we can.

        A lot of things have happened to wool. We have been forced into looking for some alternatives. We have seen wool used not only for insulation but also for mulch. It is less hazardous than some other insulation materials. We have seen the development of garments which are suitable for hot as well as cold climates. We have seen excellent blends, some of which are on display on the Senate side of Parliament House, on the first floor in the public area. I would urge all honourable members and members of the public to visit the displays and to say hello to the people from all over Australia who have been prepared to come and show what they can do with wool.

        We can see a combination of wool with that diamond fibre, mohair, which absorbs dyes well and which is light yet warm. When wool is combined with another fibre, we get the best of both fibres. It can be combined with many other fibres: with angora from rabbits, with alpaca, with cashmere from the bush goat around Australia. There have been some great combinations. Mounting displays are firms like Wool Wise Buying of Queanbeyan and Tooralli from Bombala in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Peter and Clare Smith, farmers at Bombala, were driving in their car one day and despairing at the wool price, which was down as low as 150c and 180c. They said, `What are we going to do?'. `We still have to pay good prices for woollen garments; let us take it right through', they thought.

They get the product at the start of the process, off the sheep's back, and they take it to the end of the process, when they weave it and produce the final product. They do what they and their large staff at Bombala are good at.

        In April 1993, our market indicator showed 181c for wool. There has been progress. Now the price is about 564c. In 1989-90, the amount of wool we exported was 1.1 million tonnes, but by 1991-92 it had dropped to 875,000 tonnes. The value of exports dropped from $4,647 million in 1988-89 to $2,560 million in 1991-92. However, the market is now quite strong.

To continue: in the past year we have seen Russia pay cash for a large purchase of wool. That is a good sign. China is now back in the market for over-20-micron wool. Korea and Taiwan have shown great interest. While 564c is not as much as we would like, it is close to the amount needed for a medium sized farm to be profitable.

        I have talked about the international changes which have helped the wool industry. The honourable member for Parkes has dealt with much of the history of the industry, but other measures have been taken. They include the establishment of new industry bodies with a clear commercial focus. We have seen the establishment of new mechanisms for marketing wool. We have seen an Australian trade and investment package to expand the international wool trade, with bipartisan and grower support to build demand, promote quality and reliability to clients, and build new markets which spread the risk. That is very important.

        There is no doubt that historically the wool industry has contributed dramatically to Australia's wealth. In fact, as I have pointed out to the parliament before, when I was a child our history and geography books made reference to Australia living off the sheep's back. I can still visualise the drawing of the sheep grazing with the Great Australian Bight over its back.

        It has been a wonderful contributor. When I spoke to the parliament back in December 1991 first proposing that the House should take a particular interest and arrange National Wool Day, which this parliament did, I pointed out that at that time, 1991—I am afraid things have changed slightly since then—in the 25 years prior to 1991, wool has been our major export commodity in eight of the 25 years. It had been our second major export commodity after coal in seven of those 25 years; our third major export commodity after coal and wheat and other agricultural products on seven occasions and after coal and iron ore on one occasion; and our fourth major export commodity after coal, wheat and iron ore on two occasions.

        In other words, in the 25 years prior to 1991, wool as an export commodity has never been further back than fourth, and in fact that was only on two occasions. Unfortunately we have got to add a couple of occasions to that list today. I see in the statistics for 1992-93 that wool came in at No. 6. Nevertheless, that is still a very important contributor to our national economy, to paying off the debt that we contract with the world whenever we buy more from the world than we export.

        Mr Acting Speaker, I thank you and your office which have been generally very cooperative. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) mentioned the efforts of Ron Edwards when we got the first National Wool Day off the ground. They were significant. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and I clearly understand that without the cooperation of the Presiding Officers we would not be able to achieve the success we have with this day.

        I recall—the honourable member for Eden-Monaro might also remember it—that there was one permission we did not get last time but it had a great effect when those sheep suddenly started grazing on the lawns of Parliament House and proved a point that they would do no damage. I am delighted to think that—I believe it will take place at 11 o'clock this morning—some sheep will be unloaded again. We are now so confident of our sheep handling techniques that we are not even going to put a fence up; the dogs will control them. I think it is probably worth putting on the record that when a previous Speaker told me to get rid of them I said that he could do that but that I have the dogs. It was a great day and I am delighted to think the parliament, albeit in a less spectacular way, is choosing to recognise this industry today.

        Australia recognises all sorts of things through national days. I have drawn to the attention of the parliament that we even have a red nose day, and that is for a good cause.

This is a great example of how both sides of the parliament can get together and do things together in the national interest. There is no doubt that supporting the industry is in the national interest. I would like to further thank Holeproof for donating 200-odd pairs of socks so that every member of both houses could wear a pair of red socks to the parliament today. The minister at the table, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), is apologising to me because she did not wear trousers so that she could wear red socks. I do not think that is a real problem. I sincerely hope that at least for question time she will pull a pair of red socks on over her stockings, if only because it would be good fun. We can be in these things, as the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) has just demonstrated, coming in wearing that magnificent garment. Having heard of the demise of a minister, I think he really wants to be the count or counter, whichever way one wants to put it. On the other hand, it demonstrates that people can in fact join in this day in a light-hearted way and have some fun. It is only when we do such things that I think we appear human on that machine that constantly records our activities.

Wool will protect them from cold; it will protect them from rain. I am sure that in that wonderful cloak that the honourable member for McEwen is wearing he could go out in any storm, political or otherwise, and it would protect him.

        The CSIRO Division of Wool Technology in Geelong is another contributor to our displays today. It is to be congratulated on its role in bringing technology to the industry, taking away shrinkage and all those things that some of us remember about wool but that younger members in the House would not. I hope that when we see the budget in May its efforts will be properly recognised in the maintenance of the government's dollar for dollar contribution to go along with the research contribution of woolgrowers in maintaining their excellent efforts. The honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) may be making a contribution during this debate.

        I have not referred to a lot of the statistics that I thought I might have to, but I would like to close by making the point that the magnificent growth in prosperity in Asia and other areas is a wonderful message for wool. In Korea it was pointed out to me that originally the Koreans re-exported nearly every kilo of wool they imported. Today 50 per cent of it stays in the country. People's standards of living have risen and they want to consume the product themselves. Surely, our target is to see these countries rise in prosperity and spend their money on such superior products as wool. I am sure it is going to happen. I thank my colleagues and express my pleasure that together we are celebrating and recognising an industry of such importance.

        In my electorate, at the dawn of Victoria as a constitutional entity, a lady known as Elizabeth Furlong entered into the Strathbogie-Euroa areas, as they are now known, and introduced the first major wool flock into that region. In fact she established what is now known as the `Seven Creek Run', one of the most famous of Victorian sheep properties, a merino property, which is still in existence today though vastly smaller than what it was originally. In speaking of the industry in Australia we should never forget the contribution that many women have made to this industry over the years. Even today women are very much involved in the wool industry. They are involved in value adding, and there is no doubt whatsoever that the future of the industry lies very much in not looking at its past but looking at what it can do today and at its future. Its future lies in value adding.

All the wool is scoured in Australia and the yarn is manufactured in Australia. The product is designed and made in Australia. It is a statement of fashion; it is a statement of quality; it is a statement of where the industry must go. It is a unique fabric. Very few countries can produce a mohair wool blend. Indeed it is not a secret that some honourable members of this parliament like to travel overseas and spend many thousands of dollars on suits made from mohair wool. There is no need for any Australian today to travel overseas to buy the best fabrics that the world can produce because they are all produced and made in Australia. Honourable members of this House should have a look. They will find on display mohair wool suits; they will find on display alpaca wool.

        My message to the House and, indeed, my message to Australia is, firstly, not to be frightened of change. The wool industry has been through a very traumatic experience in the last few years and those of us who have electorates with woolgrowers in them know this full well. Indeed, my colleague Jim Snow and I were in Europe last year. In Europe, we met with the International Wool Trading Organisation and we visited a factory in Aalst in Belgium. It is using some 40 tonnes of Australian wool a week, as I recall, and it is only working at roughly two-thirds capacity. The factory produces a beautiful fibre.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The message we got in Europe was very clear: the future of wool is assured. I come back to my message to the House today. I do not want to see the value get added elsewhere. I do not want to see products like this imported into Australia. I do not want to see Australians buying fabric made overseas, and the value added overseas by producing suits which are then imported and sold here, when we can do that ourselves and arguably do it better. There is no doubt that we have some of the best fashion designers in the world. There is no doubt about that. It is interesting that it is small business which is pushing this drive for value adding. Small business is prepared to take a punt and put its money where its mouth is. I know it has not been easy for many of them. They are prepared to value add and produce niche marketing products. Garments like this will not be commonly sold over the K Mart range of stores. It is a niche quality product. It is a valuable, fine, beautiful product. Again I invite honourable members to have a look.

The Spotted Jumbuk runs a unique herd of sheep with spotted colours. It specialises in one particular type of sheep which produces a spotted fleece and it uses that fleece as a value added product.

Alpaca wool is certainly a superfine soft product; it blends beautifully with sheep wool.

        —In the late 1960s the wool industry collapsed. We were selling wool for 25c to 28c a kilo. I remember the horrific stories my father used to come home with when he was a newly elected member of parliament. He would tell us just how grim things were. We lost almost an entire generation of wool producers during that period. I was a young person at the time and I could clearly see that there was no future for wool. Nothing could have looked grimmer.

        Labour costs in Australia were going through the roof, and wool is a very high labour input commodity because of shearing costs. The rate of the Australian dollar was soaring because of the minerals boom. Synthetics, wool's competitor, were hitting their straps. A combination of those things, plus the continuous cycle of droughts that had occurred during the 1960s, indicated to me that there was no future in wool. Some people I knew bought 20,000 old female sheep at $1 per head, and they still had a couple of lambs. That herd of 20,000 grew to 40,000, and I saw the price go to $17 per head some three or four years later. That indicated to me very graphically the cyclical nature of our internationally traded commodities, of which wool was by far and away the most prominent.

        In the late 1960s the then Minister for Primary Industry, Doug Anthony, in a desperate effort to try to save the wool producers, started a buying-in scheme for wool. That was the only real course left to him because so many elements of the industry were trenchantly opposed to any form of statutory marketing. So Mr Anthony introduced that form of minimum pricing, and that gave us a price for our product. It was the first time in the history of the industry that we had seen stability.

He said that occurred in the wool industry, and nothing could have looked grimmer there. He said it had occurred twice in the sugar industry, and to bear that in mind whenever there were decisions to make in the future. The tremendous success of that great industry in Queensland, the sugar industry, is a very firm monument and tribute to the work of Sir Joseph McEvoy and those people that believe in some form of minimum pricing.

        When my father died I gave the panegyric at the funeral. I was trying to think of what was the most important thing that had happened in his lifetime. I said on that occasion that the most important thing that ever happened to us people that live west of the Great Dividing Range was the introduction of the minimum price scheme in wool. Whilst we could do nothing about droughts or fires or floods, we most certainly could do something about the marketing arrangements. There was absolute proof of that in the fact that the price, for the first time in 20 years, stayed stable and above a given minimum. The importance of a minimum price scheme is that when the price starts to fall it holds the price at a minimum. The minute the price started to fall, instead of attempting to hold it at the minimum price, the government cut and ran. I am not making a political point. This is a fairly apolitical debate today. Both sides of the House agreed with that, but I have to make the point with as much conviction as I can that it was a dreadful mistake.

        I was on the national body that looked into the beef crisis, minimum pricing in the beef industry and the problems of the beef industry in Australia. We went all over Australia, and it was very clear to me what needed to be done in the beef industry at the time. We never got any form of minimum pricing arrangements in the beef industry and many hundreds, maybe thousands, of producers in Queensland were left with absolutely nothing after three and four generations of sacrifice on the land. They were utterly destroyed. I do not think that that is the way we want to run agriculture. No other country in the world runs agriculture that way. The difference between Australia and other countries is that we do not have a protected home market. Almost all of our product in such things as sugar, wool and beef goes overseas and we have to ride a terrible roller-coaster in the international marketplace.

        In talking about the wool industry, I must point out the hardship that the pioneers endured and the sacrifices they made in this area. One of the stories that always leaps to my mind is the case of the Thompsons. Mr and Mrs Thompson took some 6,000 head of sheep from the Darling Downs into the mid-west area of North Queensland. They both died, and they were found by a black tracker and a neighbouring grazier some time later. There was hardly any of their herd left by the time they had got to North Queensland. The black tracker was able to work out what had happened. The people had gone without water for four or five days in the northern heat and they were apparently quite demented. The wife was in a terrible physical condition and the husband had shot her and then staggered on himself. Some two miles later he fell into a billabong. He had his water bottle with him. He then dragged himself on all fours back to his wife to give her a drink. But he was in such a demented condition that he had forgotten that he had answered his wife's pleas and put her out of her misery. When he realised that she was dead and that he had shot her, he then shot himself and fell over her body. These are the sorts of sacrifices that had been made.

        Another story involved a grazing family in my area, at a place called Alston Vale. One of them had been away droving a big mob of sheep. When he came home for holidays, he saw that there had been a huge flood and he saw sheep hanging up in the trees. As he went to the homestead, he saw that there was nobody there and that the flood had run over the top of the homestead. In looking around, he realised that a number of the bodies up in the trees that he thought were dried out sheep were in fact his mother, his father and his three brothers and sisters. These are the sacrifices that have been made by these people generation after generation.

        We have lost 25 per cent of our national flock. By the year 2009 there will be an extra 300 million people in the countries we trade with in the Pacific basin, and certainly they will need wool. They have the fastest growing economies in the world; they will be very rich people. In fact, a third of the Pacific basin countries are already the richest on earth—the United States, Canada and Japan—but other countries, such as Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, are not far behind them.

        So the markets will be there and yet we have lost 25 per cent of our flock. We have lost thousands of people with skills and expertise to maximise our production effort and minimise our cost levels. There have been two reports, one by the Arid Zone Centre at Longreach—an update of debt levels and stock numbers in western Queensland—and the other by the Careforce committee at Longreach including the DPI, the ABC, churches, trade unions and a number of other groups. This report says that 72 per cent of sheepmen are living off non-farm production. They are going further and further into debt or they have off-farm means of income or they are using some other method of financing themselves on the farm—and this is happening when the price is 500c a kilo, not 350c a kilo as it has been in some of the years we have just gone through.

        The other report says that the average debt level is $371,000 and debt is accruing at $70,000 a year. That means that within two or three years most of those people with debt will be declared insolvent by the banks—at least two-thirds of them—and one-third of them are probably already insolvent. And for the first time ever in Australian history we have done nothing about this problem.

        —It gives me great pleasure to participate in this debate today and my congratulations go to members on both sides of the House who also are participating in the debate. I will not speak at length on the wool industry in a global sense. Rather, I will relate my comments to the area that I represent, the seat of Corio, which takes in the greater part of the city of Geelong. I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that my opposite number on the other side of the river and on the other side of the political fence, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), is also participating in this debate. He has had a long association with the wool industry and he has the interest of the industry at heart, as I have. We might differ from time to time on the means by which this industry might develop, but essentially both of us see great potential for the Geelong region through the growth of the wool industry.

        Many regional centres throughout the length and breadth of Australia identify with particular commodities, particular products and particular processes. Our neighbour in the state of Victoria, the great city of Ballarat, is strongly identified with gold. Geelong's major identification is with wool. It is not just a regional identification in that Australians might acknowledge Geelong as a great wool production and distribution centre, but also it has international identification. Many of the brand names of manufacturers in Europe refer to Geelong wool, not Australian wool. I am referring to Zegna and Pringle of Scotland who use the brand name `Geelong wool'. Geelong has a great asset already in the name `Geelong wool' and the city and the region can develop it even further.

        Geelong has had a long association with wool production and distribution. I will not go into the ins and outs of the history, but in recent times we have seen a significant decline in the wool industry in the Geelong region. However, I am pleased to say that moves are under way, both within the industry and government circles, to place Geelong again at the forefront of industry development of this commodity.

        If we look at the city of Geelong we see that this city and its immediate hinterland have some great wool assets that they can build upon and develop. As I mentioned before, Geelong already has an international brand image. It has one of the most productive wool hinterlands in Australia, for the production of both coarse wools and fine wools. We have an excellent transport infrastructure—road, rail and sea—which has the capacity to transport wool from the hinterland to the major production centre and then distribute the value added product to the rest of the world.

        Geelong also has one of the great wool research and development facilities. There are some 300 people employed at the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology. It is the largest wool research facility in the world, with an asset value in excess of $100 million. It has extensive laboratories and even has a modern processing mill. In the development of machinery it has achieved successes which have been adapted by textile manufacturers right around the world. Of course, the way in which the CSIRO has been able to match the chemical processes with the needs of the environment is one of the great strengths of this particular facility.

        Geelong in the past was, and is even now, a major value added wool processing centre. It is this area that offers great potential for further development and employment growth. The value adding activities in Geelong include the wool scouring at BWK and Robinsons, tops making at BWK, carpet manufacture at Godfrey Hirst and Brintons, the production of woven upholstered fabrics at Classweave and a range of smaller companies producing automotive upholstery, clothing and fashion garments as well.

Its export sales have increased by over 500 per cent. Its employees have increased by 900, with a 300 increase since June 1993. The company recently acquired Homfray-Hycraft in a rationalisation which was supported by the federal government through the TCFDA. The company has expanded in line with the government's vision for this part of the textile industry. I pay particular tribute to the owner, Mr George McKendrick, who has taken up the challenge that was issued to this section of the textile industry by ex-Minister Button when he was in the industry chair. The company is now the largest manufacturer of carpet wool yarns in the world. Its monthly usage of scoured wool is some 1,000 tonnes. To put that into an equivalent production capacity off the sheep's back, that is some four million sheep.

It has had some difficulties with its production processes, but is finally in a position to launch into the marketplace in many avenues. The firm produces fine woollen baby blankets, fine woollen dressing gowns, fine woollen underwear, fine woollen sports and leisure wear and, of course, industrial wear. My great hope is one day to see Gary Ablett taking one of the most spectacular marks that the Australian Rules code has ever seen, while he is wearing a fine woollen Geelong football jumper produced from fine wools in the Geelong hinterland and value added in the Geelong region.

It is time that it was brought home to Australia, and it ought to be located in Geelong. Geelong is the wool capital of Australia and of the southern hemisphere.

Over a decade now we have been engaging in political battle, but this particular industry is one which is close to both our hearts. He did assure me today that he would wear the red socks and I would imagine, given his political complexion, this would be about the only time he would wear a red garment. I have got my red socks on today, and he has got his on, over there. I think that is a first. But I have gone one better: not only am I wearing the socks, I am wearing the jocks—but I am not going to show them here today.

        —I am pleased to be part of this debate during National Wool Week, and certainly it is a particular pleasure to enjoy the bipartisan nature of the debate and the good humour across the chamber this morning. I suppose my first memory of the wool industry as a young fellow in the wool boom is that of going around picking up the remains from the paddock for pocket money. That little story tells people about my beginnings in the wool industry. I should have been prepared for the great price fluctuations. There we were, going around the paddock picking up the dead wool: such was the nature of the demand at that time. When I started farming in 1969, the wool prices were the lowest ever, and the late 1980s and early 1990s also had pretty disastrous effects for the wool industry, particularly at the grower level.

        But wool is more than just an industry and more than just a commodity. It is part of Australia's culture, as we well know. I am thinking of some of the great storytellers of this place: people like Clyde Cameron and Mick Young, both of them South Australians. One of Clyde's stories that I loved was from when he was a learner shearer. When Clyde first started shearing he was battling along, as we all do as learner shearers. It was a pretty tough season and, as Clyde tells it, he took so long to shear an old cracker ewe that it had died while it was on the board.

        In those days, a shearer did not get paid, as I understand it, if the sheep passed away on the board. It was a pretty long board, and the boss was at the other end, so Clyde shot out and dragged the sheep out into the let-out pen and stood it up on a stick. The sheep stood up there till the end of the run, when the boss went and counted them out. The boss came back to Clyde and said, `That sheep is dead!'. `No', said Clyde, `not when I put it out!'. That story is part of the humour and enjoyment that we have all shared on the wool board at shearing time over the years.

        As a sheep farmer, of course, one does see the other side of it, when one is responsible for showing a profit and loss each year and each season. At this point, it is worth having a look at what Ross Garnaut said in the summer 1994 edition of

        The discussion provided some important insights more specifically into the political economy of the Australian wool industry. Despite the wool industry's tragically diminished current circumstances, its members are turning to government for assistance less than other sections of the Australian economy that are not experiencing such severe problems. The wool industry, for all its problems, is still prepared to face structural change more readily than many parts of the economy.

        The Report was prepared at a time of crisis in the wool industry. On the day our commission was announced the real price of wool at auction was the lowest this century.

        It is significant that at a time of wool industry crisis, a Report which sees no part of a solution in increasing government subsidy has been mostly warmly welcomed by the wool-growing community. Here the bush has a lesson for Sydney. The wool industry, now little subsidised and prospectively not subsidised at all, continues to pay its share of the subsidies and protection that others still get. It continues to pay its share of the cost increasing regulatory arrangements in many other industries. The wool industry is not demanding subsidies comparable to other industries. In these circumstances, Sydney owes the bush a commitment to get on with cost-reducing restructuring in the rest of the economy. The least that urban Australia can do for the bush, is to continue the process of the past decade; to continue getting off the sheep's back.

        We all know about the income levels, et cetera. I will not dwell on that. The real price of wool is showing some improvement, which is to be welcomed. One thing about the wool market share is quite interesting when we look back over the last 50 years: in 1940 wool made up 12.38 per cent of the world textile market compared to 12.17 per cent for synthetics; in 1988-89, the wool share fell to 4.86 per cent—and no doubt has picked up a little since then—while synthetics increased its share to 45.77 per cent. Of course, as I said, it is winning back more of its share today and the price relativities with cotton and synthetics are as good as they have ever been.

One of the catalysts for promotion here today is the drastic circumstances that it found itself in.

What I always remember about the women in the downturn of the late 1960s is the wool awareness groups that sprang up all over Australia and how they in their own way contributed to a greater wool awareness throughout the nation. Quality is going to be as important as it has ever been.

From my reading of history he should, more properly, as so often is the case, have mentioned the part played by Macarthur's wife. There are other people who should be mentioned. For example, Thomas Shaw came to Australia 150 years ago from Bradford. He taught Australian farmers how to prepare their woolclip. He played a large part in developing the future of the Australian wool trade.

Other unsung heroes include the small family company in France of Slumberjay, which makes the combs that comb the long Australian wool. That company makes those combs for the entire world. It has stuck to this task through thick and thin. Without that company no fine Australian merino wool would be used commercially.

        At this conference he virtually said to the Europeans, `The game is up. The processing industry will move to Australia, not just because Australia is where the merinos grow, but because of technological advancements there'. The truth is that the new plants in Australia, those owned by Austops and by Bremmer Woll Kammeri in Geelong, are producing at the rate of 100 tonnes per man per year, whereas those in Europe and Japan are averaging about 50 tonnes per year. It is that productivity that has given Australia an enormous advantage.

        This is going to have big political implications because we will see exports of wool from Australia go from around $5 billion a year to $20 billion within the next 15 years. It will be without a doubt Australia's major export once again. The important thing is that this will occur in regional Australia; it will not be centred on the cities of Australia. It will restore enormous political clout to country towns. One of the troubles of the wool industry is that it has had no political representation; the numbers are small and by and large it has been represented by the National Party, and everyone can understand what that means.

        The wool industry will now have a lot of allies in the manufacturing industry. We are going to see workers have a direct vested interest in the welfare of the wool industry, and I am sure that it will go from strength to strength. It is going to restore prosperity to country towns, because these wool processing plants are going to employ lots of people. There is going to be work once again in country areas. Over time governments in Australia, whether they are Liberal Party or whether they are Labor Party, have tended to be city dominated and, worst of all, Melbourne and Sydney dominated. But this is going to change, for the reality is that once we get 50 kilometres out of Melbourne and Sydney the people there probably have more in common with the people of my state than they do with people in their capital cities.

        I want to touch on a point made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) about the banks. There is no doubt that the wool industry is going to prosper. It is going to happen for a lot of reasons which give us an advantage. It is going to happen because of people's vision. The truth is that so often in the past that vision has come from very few people. I see people in this House singing a different song from the song they were singing in the early 1990s—in 1990-91. It is that bugle call of change from a few people that is going to lead rural Australia and Australia as a whole back to prosperity. It is important that the banks realise this. When I was at school many years ago, there was a rule of thumb: if you were bright you went on to tertiary education; if you were not so bright you took the public service examination, and if you failed that you went into banking. Unfortunately, those people of my generation who failed the public service examination are now at the top of the banking industry. I think this is a problem, because if the banks do not realise the potential of the wool industry in Australia they are likely to foreclose on the industry. We need a lot more commonsense and a lot more faith—faith in Australians, faith in the future of Australia and faith in the wool industry—from the banks. As the honourable member for Kennedy said, there are people who will be foreclosed out of the wool industry, who are in desperate plight through no real fault of their own.

        The reality is that the Wool Corporation did, in my estimation, three Alan Bonds' worth of damage to the economy. The difference is that Alan did most of his damage to German, French and Swiss investors, and I think that is probably not so bad. The Wool Corporation did most of its damage to Australians. It is absolutely puerile—it is wrong—to blame woolgrowers for what happened. The whole industry, the government and the opposition are all singing that same song. It is true that woolgrowers were enormously ignorant of their industry. Now that is changing. I think woolgrowers are becoming more aware.

        We have to get our thinking in perspective. We are going to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000 in Sydney, which is on the extreme east coast of Australia. I say to the Olympic committee that it ought to think seriously about making the Australian merino the symbol for the Olympic Games. A toast current in Spain around the 1580s was along the lines, `Phillip may reign but the merino is our king'. If that were true for Spain in the 1580s, it is much more true for Australia today. In the Australian merino we have a unique fibre, yet we have seen Australian wool producers' money used to promote the generic term `wool'. Generically, wool is just not the same; Australian wool cannot be compared with coarse fibre wool.

        When I did wool classing in 1956, I was told that the greatest market was in the United States; it still is. The United States is a small per capita user of wool because people there believe wool is coarse and prickly—an army uniform material. US wool is, but Australian wool is not. Through the Wool Corporation, we spent $3 billion promoting that message in the United States without appreciably increasing the sales of wool there. The potential is enormous; the Australian wool industry will go from strength to strength. I pay tribute to the often lone voices that are the bugle call for change and advancement in the Australian wool industry.

        The new scheme to deal with the wool stockpile is a fixed release arrangement. Over the next six months, 28,000 bales will be released each month and, after January 1995, 187,000 bales will be released each quarter. The problem the wool industry faces is what to do about the stockpile if the market rises dramatically. Will it stick with the fixed price schedule or will the system be changed yet again? Of course, we have been through that debate.

        One of the real problems facing the wool industry is the amount of wool that it is going to produce. Some estimates suggest that we will produce 690 million kilograms in the current year, and some others suggest that the figure will be 751 million kilograms. There are more sheep than that in New South Wales and in Western Australia. The future price affects all woolgrowers. As honourable members have said, the industry is at this stage almost unprofitable, but the price indicator at 556c on March 15 was encouraging compared with this time last year. The 19-micron wools have led the way with a remarkable recovery in price, which perhaps has given a false impression of the market indicator compared to that for the broader wools.

The recovery in most nations around the world, except in Japan and Germany, augurs well for the future of the wool industry, particularly with the buying strength of China now coming back into the market.

        As the honourable member for Corio said, we both have a vested interest in maintaining wool sales at Geelong. There is a great argument going on about centralising wool selling in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. Those of us in Geelong are suggesting that there is a very sound argument for retaining wool selling there. That is supported by the honourable member for Corio and me. There are approximately 500,000 bales of wool sold in Geelong and out of Portland compared to about 500,000 bales sold in Melbourne, just 35 minutes away. Both the honourable member for Corio and I support strongly the wool sales being continued in Geelong while the wool is sold by sample.

        Wool is a most versatile commodity. Its value is in its raw state, especially in the superfine wools. It is valuable as slightly processed into tops and it has additional value as a yarn. It has further value as it is made up into articles. From then on one can go into all sorts of flights of fantasy about what one can do with wool. Designer use of wool could yield the most specific and spectacular ideas and garments which would add great value to the woollen product. I hope everybody here today will be visiting the display that is here in the parliament and I congratulate everybody who has brought along their wares and put the display together.

We should get it down to an Australian wool and into specific areas and regions within Australia.

        Tasmania is also known for its fishing potential. Fisherman need warm clothes to cope with the harsh conditions they face down there in the roaring forties, so here is an ideal opportunity to develop a line of knitwear for work. The Australian bluey is made of felted wool. It is also very popular in most work gangs in colder climates, but I do not see it marketed very well in that line. We do not seem to market wool in some of those lines very well at all—I do not think we market them at all. The bush shirts from New Zealand seem to have a name that bush shirts that are made in Australia do not have. It would seem that only New Zealand made bush shirts. In fact we make a considerable quantity of bush shirts of high quality in this country, but we do not seem to have established our name in that area.

        We need to stimulate wool demand in a traditional sense of selling it in its raw or slightly processed state but we also need to specialise. We need to research the market better and more; we need more research on the quality of our fibre to come up with what else we can use wool for. It is known for its nonflammability and strength; in Tasmania another factory, Waverley Woollen Mills, has looked at aircraft seat covers over some time. Research should continue into the use of sheepskins in beds, particularly for those in hospitals, to help prevent bedsores. Similarly, research into many other products in that area should proceed.

         As leader of the delegation I wish to make some short remarks in relation to the report. This was the first parliamentary delegation from Australia to India since 1986, the first to Bangladesh since 1978 and the first to Nepal since 1974. The delegation had broad terms of reference, and individuals had particular interests and concerns which we were also anxious to pursue. It was a great challenge in what was a relatively short period to come to grips with the political complexities in each country and the sheer scale of the problems of south Asia. It is a natural tendency to perhaps be overwhelmed by the size of the challenges governments face in the part of the world that we visited in coping with intensive development and providing for people's basic needs.

         The delegation visited south Asia at an important period in the history of the three countries. The visit coincided with economic policy changes and the affirmation or establishment of democratic institutions. India, of course, is a robust democracy. It has a highly sophisticated political culture, as one would expect from its constitutional tradition and its achievement of unity in diversity.

         Since the end of the Cold War, India has been searching for new spheres of influence, with the end of its special relationship with the former Soviet Union. This is occurring at a time of great changes in the way in which it goes about the control of its economy. In his recent book,

        From what we observed, there have been great changes in attitude within the leadership of India. India is constructing a market economy which on the surface appears to be working well. The name of Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, whom the delegation had the pleasure to meet, is one which is often mentioned in the world's financial press.

         As we mention in the report, another first was the recent news that the Indian Revenue Bank has had to sell rupees in order to keep the value of the currency down.

         The delegation was also interested in the social effect of these changes to a market economy. This was true not only of India but also of Bangladesh and Nepal. Many of those with whom the delegation was able to speak, and this included representatives of trade organisations, were concerned about the adverse effects that economic reforms might have on those already living at a depressed level.

         As I said earlier, one of the delegation's difficulties was that, in a three-week period while visiting three countries, it had little time to fully expose itself to the depth and breadth of the problems that confronted the countries. We couch our remarks in the report in the context of understanding that difficulty. We would hope that the report is not seen to be us preaching to others about things of which we were only able to gain superficial knowledge. For instance, we highlight the question of child labour in each of the three countries. I hope that our comments are seen as observations of a problem that each of those countries must tackle. I would hope that the comments are not seen as our presuming to dictate to those who are responsible for making policy.

         The comments I have made about economic changes in India are also true for Bangladesh and Nepal. It was a bit of a surprise to members of the delegation that each of the countries had similar policy outlooks. The delegation was also interested in other matters in Bangladesh and Nepal, principally the prospects for the sustainability and stability of the newly established democratic institutions. The delegation found much optimism in both Bangladesh and Nepal that democratic solutions to the problems of development appeared to offer the most hope for these countries.

In hearing those names, people would understand that that delegation represents a rather diverse group in political views. Having said that, the way in which the delegation was able to operate in harmony and present a united front on almost all occasions is a credit to each of the individuals. However, I do not think that we left any of our hosts or the people that we spoke to with the impression that we did not have diverse views. It was not as if for the duration of the delegation's visit we said that we were all as one but, as the earlier events of National Wool Day have shown, often in this place we can see a great deal of cooperation for a mutually positive outcome.

He works in the parliamentary education office. Again, from time to time the delegation perhaps gave him a few headaches, but he was able to handle that with a great degree of good humour. During the visit and also since our return, in the preparation of the report, John has made a great contribution to the success of the delegation. I think I can say that this delegation was a good team. I thank everyone, including the two spouses that accompanied us, Mrs Beverly McArthur and Mr Jack Smith, for rallying around when it was required, contributing their share of good humour and comradeship.

         In conclusion, may I say that our delegation was impressed with its reception in all three countries. In India and Nepal we received hospitality at the highest levels and indications from ministers that Australia should be taking more interest in the affairs of south Asia. The delegation came away with the impression that south Asia has been neglected by our foreign policy makers and that more resources and commitment should be devoted to improving ties with this part of the world. While in no way questioning stronger links with the so-called tiger nations of the Pacific rim, the delegation would like to say that there are trade and investment opportunities elsewhere in Asia and that the tiger nations of the future will include countries on the Indian subcontinent more obviously identified with these magnificent animals. I commend the report to the House.

I support the remarks that you made by saying that the parliamentary delegation worked very well as a representative of this parliament. As you said, there was a divergence of views, although maybe at the conclusion of the delegation's visit I might have agreed with the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and his political viewpoint because he was so persuasive. Apart from that, I do think that it was a very united team in representing the parliament to those three countries, and I compliment you as leader for your handling of many sensitive situations and issues in those countries on behalf of the parliamentary delegation.

         This parliament has often taken for granted that it will go on and on, that ministers will come and go, that prime ministers will be elected and defeated and that, inevitably, the parliament will remain solid and strong. That is not always the case. India has had a long parliamentary tradition whereas on the subcontinent in Bangladesh and Nepal, the delegation felt concern about whether the parliamentary system as we know it would continue for years to come in view of its more recent history.

         The Acting Speaker commented on the world economy and the attitude of finance ministers in Bangladesh and in India. Our meeting with Saifur Rahman, the Bangladesh finance minister, was enlightening, to say the least. In that very small country of 120 million people the finance minister was talking about free economy, cutting taxes, creating wealth and encouraging foreign investment to that country so that Bangladesh, which is regarded as one of the poorest countries in the world, could make some economic progress and improve the standard of living of its people. It came to our attention that foreign aid was a key factor in the maintaining of the current standard of living, and one wondered whether that would be sustained forever and a day.

         India has a population of 870 million people, and this number increases by the total population of Australia each year. Historically, it is a closed economy with the dead hand of the socialist approach of the Soviet Union but it has now moved to a freer and more open economy. The delegation met with the finance minister, Man Singh, a most impressive world figure, in my view, who conveyed to the delegation India's attitude to international investment, privatisation programs, fiscal and monetary responsibility, population control, the attitude of the IMF and, of course, infrastructure improvement in terms of roads and communications. It was indicated to us that India could become a major trading partner with Australia.

         The refugee camps provided an insight and an understanding to those of us who had never seen the human side of those persons displaced from the Burmese border. There were 20 refugee camps with 250,000 refugees as at September 1992. It is a remarkable experience to see so many humans confined to such a small space, with problems of housing, nutrition and the many human problems. It seemed to us that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were doing a pretty good job under fairly difficult circumstances.

         In Nepal, which has a population of 20 million people, we enjoyed the hospitality and great understanding of Ambassador Les Douglas and his wife, Una Douglas. We understood their contribution to the Australian-Nepalese relationships, and his practical approach is to be commended. The poverty and the lack of industry in Nepal were all too apparent throughout the countryside. Democracy appeared there only in 1990 after 30 years of benign rule by the king, and it was of concern that democracy continue.

Dr Sanduk Ruit is now the leader of that program. We were most impressed with the eye camp that we visited. We saw the tremendous human joy of some of the patients who could see for the first time in 10 years—or 20 years in some cases—after the marvellous operation carried out by Dr Ruit on the day that we visited. The eye factory in Nepal, to which Australians have contributed quite significantly through Australian aid money, produces cheap lenses—for $10—which means that many of the poorer Nepalese people can have their sight returned.

         —by leave—We have a very short time in which to speak meaningfully on the problems and diversity, or indeed the potential, of the countries we visited. At the outset, let me pay tribute to you for your leadership, Mr Acting Speaker, and to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), the deputy leader. I believe that we all worked very well as a team. I have been on a delegation where the members did not work as a team, and I know the difficulties that that creates. The delegation members all came from very divergent political philosophies, but occasionally we saw eye to eye and we all had the opportunity to put our point of view. Despite the criticism that the media inevitably like to engage in about overseas trips, I believe that the taxpayers of Australia and, indeed, this parliament got value from this delegation.

         As you have said, Mr Acting Speaker, the comments we have made in our report are just that: comments. It is not for us to preach, and we do not seek to do so, to the countries we visited. It is almost impossible to meet all the interests of members of such delegations—we saw three countries of great interest and diversity in 18 days. One problem faced by each country is that of a rapidly increasing population. The economic changes in all three, especially India, will mean little unless something is done about the population.

         For example, as has been said, and as our report mentions—and it was pointed out to us many times—India adds the equivalent of the population of Australia to its population each year. Just to keep pace with that population growth, India has to create something like six to seven million new jobs each year. Even with an economic growth of up to five per cent, India can create only four million jobs. So that means that there is a cumulative pool of some two million unemployed on top of what the country already has each year.

However, I think it would have given us a better appreciation of the problems if we had seen some of the programs that were being implemented to come to terms with population growth.

In fact, when we were talking to the finance minister of India—and that was at the time when the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) was our finance minister—I thought it was the honourable member wearing a turban speaking to us. I suppose one would have to say now that it would have been the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) in a turban speaking to us. The point is that their views were very similar.

As it was for others, for me the highlight was a visit to the eye camp. I am not sure that I could have witnessed more than one eye operation, but I think one of the highlights of the visit was to be with you, Mr Acting Speaker, when someone who had not been able to see for many years had the bandages removed from his eyes and the first thing he saw after many years of darkness was your face. I am not sure whether that person wanted to be blind again or not! Nevertheless, the joy expressed on that person's face—even though your face was the first thing he saw—showed how much he appreciated being able to see again.

In each country there was a real desire for an exchange of views, particularly in the new democracies of Bangladesh and Nepal. They were anxious to find out how democracy worked. I thought at times that perhaps we were not the best people to tell them, and that if they came here and saw democracy working they might wonder whether it worked at all.

         The refugee camps at Cox's Bazaar, as the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) mentioned, did stand out. They are a huge problem. The United Nations is doing a marvellous job accommodating that problem. I was also impressed by the women's project outside Dacca where women are taken onto a project and taught life skills. They are taught how to look after themselves and they are afforded an opportunity to be self-sustaining in the future. That project is run with foreign aid.

         Before I leave the topic of Bangladesh, I would like to mention a unique opportunity I had. Through World Vision, I was able to meet one of the children that my husband and I sponsor. That child lives south of Dacca. It was just wonderful to be given the opportunity to speak with the child that we foster through World Vision. I was able to talk to that child, to find out what the child's aspirations for the future were and to find out just what the small amount of money in Australian terms that I give each month can do, not only for the child, but also for the family and for the whole community. That was an astounding experience, and one that I am very glad I was given the opportunity to have. If I get that opportunity again, I will do it again. Our second sponsored child is in Madras in southern India.

         From Bangladesh we went to Nepal, as other speakers have already mentioned. The thing that stood out there was the Fred Hollows eye camp under Dr Ruit. I do not know about the other members of the delegation, but I watched 2 1/2 operations. I was amazed not only by the conditions, but also by the speed with which those operations were done. It was great to know that our foreign aid is affording people in such incredible poverty the opportunity to see the world. Their world, in our eyes, is something that we do not want to live in, but at least they are given the opportunity.

On the day we were there we saw an old man who had been blind for years. One eye was operated on that day, and the second eye was to be done the next day. Just seeing that man's face when the eye patch came off was a miracle in itself. Our foreign aid is creating some of those miracles.

        This bill proposes an amendment to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. Details of the amendment are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. The bill has been made necessary by the issue of letters patent to the Hon. Gordon Samuels AC, QC and also to Mr Michael Codd AC to conduct an inquiry into the operation and management of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. That inquiry has been asked by the government to report if possible by 30 September 1994 and in any case by 31 December 1994.

         As the terms of reference include the effectiveness and suitability of existing arrangements for control and accountability of ASIS and the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to ASIS, it is likely that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have information and documents which would be of considerable relevance to the inquiry. Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that provisions in the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act which were intended to give the maximum possible protection to information held by the inspector-general may actually preclude the Inspector-General from providing information or documents to the inquiry, therefore substantially impeding the ability of the inspector-general to cooperate with the inquiry.

         Subsection 34(1) of the act precludes the inspector-general and his or her staff from disclosing or communicating to any person any information obtained by reason of the person having held one of those positions, except in the performance of duties and the exercise of powers under the act. The inspector-general's powers and functions are listed comprehensively in the act, and do not include the giving of evidence to royal commissions and similar inquiries. The effect of this is that the inspector-general may not lawfully disclose information or give documents to the inquiry.

         The bill is intended to remove this difficulty. It will permit the current and former inspector-general and the current and former staff of the inspector-general to give information and evidence to commissions of inquiry conducted by the Hon.

In that way, it will ensure that the commissions have access to a class of information which would be among the most relevant available.

In that way, the present position, which emphasises the need to maintain the greatest possible protection for the privacy of individuals and for information about matters related to security, will be preserved as far as possible. The introduction of the bill is a measure of the importance which the government attaches to enabling the commissions of inquiry to conduct the fullest examination of the matters within their terms of reference. I commend the bill to the House.

         —The opposition supports and welcomes this legislation, the purpose of which is to permit the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and his staff to provide information to the forthcoming judicial inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. I welcome it not least because it was in part the calls for the investigation of ASIS from the coalition—in particular, from me—which led to the government's decision to set up such an inquiry. The other impetus to the establishment of the inquiry was, of course, the allegations made by former ASIS officers on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Four Corners
         </emphasis>
         program on the ABC on 21 February. I very much doubt that without these stimuli the government would have established an independent judicial inquiry into ASIS.

         Just as the government had to be prodded into holding the inquiry in the first place, so is its current attitude to the inquiry—and, in particular, to the issues which led to its establishment—quite unsatisfactory. In fact this legislation is the first sign of glasnost—if I may use an appropriate term—in the government's handling of the issue. The government's decision to hold an inquiry into ASIS presents the opportunity to allay concerns about the service; to redress what in my view are genuine grievances against it; and to carry out whatever changes may be necessary. However, I very much fear that if the arrangements for the inquiry are perceived to be unfair or too narrow, then this opportunity may be lost.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe the inquiry must be able to effectively allay concerns about ASIS and that in order to do so these concerns must be properly ventilated. I repeat that the introduction of this legislation is the first indication that I have had that the government is seriously attempting to clear the air.

         I have stated on a number of occasions that I have reservations about the arrangements for the inquiry as they stand at present, and I have three major concerns. First, I believe that Mr Michael Codd, who is referred to in the legislation before the House, has been so closely associated with the government's oversight of the intelligence services by virtue of his presiding over the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security as well as the Office of Security and Intelligence Coordination as to disqualify him from the position of commissioner assisting.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I know Mr Codd personally. I know him professionally. I know him to be a public servant of great ability and of the highest integrity. Of that there can be no doubt at all. But I do not think it reasonable to put him in a position where he may be asked to effectively judge his own performance at the head of the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security and of the Office of Security and Intelligence Coordination. It is a bit like the need for justice to not only be done but be seen to be done. It is crucially important if you have these inquiries that there be no doubt in the minds of people, particularly those close to the issues involved, that there is no conflict at all. The appointment, indeed, of Mr Chris Maxwell as counsel assisting the inquiry raises similar concerns. He was once employed on Senator Evans's staff when the latter was Attorney-General. That is the first concern.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second concern is that the inquiry's terms of reference are too narrow. And I am particularly concerned by the exclusion of `the functional role and priorities of ASIS' from the inquiries remit, as this gives rise to suspicion that the inquiry will look solely at how ASIS is run and not at what it does. The allegations on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Four Corners
         </emphasis>
         report did raise serious concerns about ASIS operations; therefore, I think it important they be investigated.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         My third concern also relates to the terms of reference. Given the role that complaints by former ASIS officers have played in this affair to date, I believe that in order to be credible the inquiry must address their grievances, regardless of what procedures have already been gone through, including procedures such as internal inquiries, grievance committees and IGIS investigations in connection with their cases.

         I note that Senator Evans addressed the issues that I have raised with him before in his answers to Senate Estimates Committee A on 18 March. Senator Evans's performance in this Senate estimates hearing lacked a touch of credibility. On the one hand, Senator Evans repeatedly stressed that the conduct and scope of the inquiry were now solely a matter for the inquiry itself, by saying, for example:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the Government's role is stopped with the establishment of the inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, Senator Evans repeatedly expressed the government's view of how it hoped the inquiry would conduct itself:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I again hope that the Commissioners take a similarly liberal view.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On occasion, Senator Evans was even more frank about the government's plans for the inquiry:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I do not think that anybody within ASIS or the government thinks that all that—

        namely, individual grievances already processed by IGIS—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        should be revisited.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, despite Senator Evans's protestations that the government is now distanced from the inquiry, it is patently obvious that the government has a strong agenda of its own for the inquiry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I want to return to the three concerns I earlier mentioned. On the question of the suitability of Mr Michael Codd acting as commissioner assisting, Senator Evans said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Codd is at shoulder level as the Commissioner Assisting the commissioner. He's been vested with the necessary powers so that particular aspects of the inquiry can proceed in parallel. He can hear witnesses and make necessary orders about the terms of suppression of confidential information and so on. But it is not to be understood—this is perfectly well understood by Mr Codd—that he assumes responsibility for the final content of the report. Essentially, he will be feeding into that process. Similarly, the counsel assisting—the lawyer, Mr Maxwell—will be on the other side of the triangle feeding the legal input into the final product.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is precisely because Mr Codd and Mr Maxwell will be `feeding' the commissioner that I hold doubts as to the wisdom of their appointments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For a long time, as I said, Mr Codd occupied a position at the very apex of the administrative mechanism for the oversight of Australia's intelligence community. I have previously expressed my reservations about the wisdom of putting Mr Codd into a position where he may have to pass judgment on his own actions while presiding over the standing committee.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Allied to this comes the news today—just today—that Mr Codd has also been appointed to inquire into Mr Griffiths' discharge of his ministerial responsibilities in the light of the sandwich shop affair—for God's sake! Like the inquiry into ASIS, this is a very important matter. A minister resigns, there are police investigations, there are likely prosecutions—not of Mr Griffiths, but of others involved—and his ministerial conduct is being inquired into; and Mr Codd, while being appointed to conduct this inquiry with Mr Samuels, will be called upon here to pronounce upon questions which go to the heart of principles of ministerial responsibility and accountability.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Quite apart from that factor, there is the point that I mentioned before: given that Mr Codd has taken on this additional very weighty burden—it is not a light thing to inquire into a minister's behaviour—the public and this House have a right to know to which inquiry he will be giving priority. If he cannot give the ASIS inquiry his full attention, frankly, he should step down as commissioner assisting. If he cannot do the inquiry into the Griffiths sandwich shop affair effectively, he should not have been appointed to that.

         It is very hard for me to recall, in nearly 28 years in this parliament, someone being appointed to a royal commission to inquire into a matter—and, as the minister said today, to report preferably by September of this year—and then be asked to inquire into the sandwich shop affair at the same time. I assume they are discrete, in the old sense of the word—they are separate—unless we are going to have spies in the sandwich shop as well. And that is going to make interesting reading! I would like an indication as to why the same man has been appointed to chase the sandwich shop meanderings as well as to chase the boys from ASIS. At the end of the day there is going to be a lack of time for him to do this job—running at the same time—and if he cannot give the ASIS inquiry his full attention, as I say, he should step down or be asked to step down.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is no reflection on him. I regard Michael Codd very highly indeed. It is just unfortunate that the government has asked this man, who is going, as I say, in my view, to be compromised because of his previous roles in heading up the committee on security and intelligence at the secretary's level, to also do the extraordinary sandwich shop inquiry. I would like to hear more on this.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On another matter, may I go back to Senator Evans and the Senate estimates committee hearing. Honourable members will recall that Mr Maxwell, who is the man appointed as commissioner assisting the inquiry, was working for Senator Evans in his office—not when Senator Evans was foreign minister, but when he was Attorney-General. Senator Evans was able to recollect, before the Senate estimates committee, that while Mr Maxwell, now counsel assisting the inquiry, was working in his office, Mr Maxwell had dealt with matters relating to the intelligence community—another question of compromise. However, Senator Evans's fabled memory—perhaps he had a touch of selective amnesia—deserted him when he was asked a question about whether or not Mr Maxwell had sought Labor Party preselection. I do not know whether he did or not. That should not disqualify him per se but, when we are looking at these questions of being a trifle compromised, it is a matter that at least can be raised.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Taking Senator Evans's pronouncements on the matter all together, it is not too much to say that his approach to this whole issue is that either nothing at all, or very little, has been wrong with the government's stewardship of the intelligence community. If this is the government's position, then I believe it is demonstrable in a number of specific cases that this is false. I make this assertion only on the basis of the very limited information on the subject available to the opposition. Those who are in full possession of the facts, such as Senator Evans and Mr Codd, must be aware of other cases. I do believe it is likely that the cases of people with grievances, which have been brought to public attention in recent days, represent only a minor proportion of such cases. This is a matter of concern down the line. The government's appointment of two people, as commissioner assisting and as counsel assisting, who have been so closely associated with the government's management of the intelligence services, simply reinforces the impression that the government is in whitewash mode.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I have said before, my second concern related to the exclusion of `the functional role and priorities of ASIS' from the purview of the inquiry. Senator Evans has undergone a change of heart on this issue. In Senate Estimates Committee A on 22 February, in speaking about an internal inquiry into ASIS, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You would be looking at the operational brief for the organisation . . . the extent to which the organisation was actually carrying out clearly prescribed government directives. You would be looking at the formal charter of the organisation. You would, no doubt . . . be revisiting again the question as to whether or not ASIS should have a formal statutory basis . . . You would be looking at, I guess, financial issues, expenditure, control systems and all the rest of it. All of those issues would reasonably be on the table.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the words of Senator Evans. Clearly, all these issues are not on the table. Senator Evans, in the Senate estimates committee meeting later—not the one in February that I have just quoted, but one on 18 March—said that the question of the function and role of ASIS is `squarely a matter for executive government decision'. Save for the fact that during the period between these two Senate hearings Senator Evans was prodded into declaring an independent judicial inquiry, it is difficult to see what other factors may have prompted this about-face.

         program on ASIS did raise very serious concerns precisely about the function and about the role of ASIS. Senator Evans has insisted that the government's 1992 internal review of the Australian intelligence community has already adequately addressed these questions. I simply say that I doubt it. I see no reason why the function and role of these secretive and expensive intelligence and security organisations should not be subject to impartial external scrutiny, having due regard to national security considerations, as was the case in the Hope royal commissions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         My third concern is the question of the resolution of individual grievances against ASIS. As I have said, the government appears to take the view that those individual grievances, particularly those that were the subject of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Four Corners
         </emphasis>
         report, have been given as much investigation and scrutiny as is consistent with the principles of natural justice. Yet at the same time, by opening up grievance resolution mechanisms such as the Inspector-General—that is, IGIS—to judicial scrutiny, the government is admitting at least the possibility that all might not be too well. All might not be well. So there is a clear contradiction in the government's approach.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">

         The fact is that it was the revelations made in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Four Corners
         </emphasis>
         program that prompted the government to set up the inquiry in the first place. I note that in the Senate estimates committee of 18 March Senator Evans did not rule out the question of individual grievances being investigated by the inquiry in that they bore on aspects of ASIS's management and IGIS's performance. But the failure by the government to explicitly address these individual grievances shows the hollowness of its professed willingness to mount a comprehensive investigation of ASIS.

          Finally, I have been briefed by ASIS in recent months. Bear in mind—I do not dwell on this—that I administered ASIS for a very long time in the period of the Fraser government. I know the organisation. I have respected it, but I have indicated elsewhere my concerns with what has transpired. For all that I have been briefed recently by ASIS, I do believe that existing procedures for keeping the opposition, no matter who is in opposition at the time, informed on such matters are flawed in that such briefings occur only at the whim of the government. The government can prevent me getting a briefing on ASIS. That is not right, and it has to end.

         In conclusion, I reiterate a major concern, namely, the compromised position of Mr Michael Codd, for whom, I have said on two occasions in this address, I have the highest regard but whom the government has placed in an extraordinarily compromised position. My concern is exacerbated by the announcement today that Mr Codd is now to investigate Mr Griffiths's sandwich shop operations. How we are going to promote the two, I do not know. But these concerns are genuine concerns that should be addressed by the government and regrettably are not by this legislation, which is nevertheless legislation that we support.

         —It is always an interesting experience to follow the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in any debate. Some of us feel that, with the names that are being mentioned as possible leaders of the opposition, the honourable member's name should be put back into the ring. It seems to me that, with the concerns that the honourable member raised, anyone listening would agree that there is a problem with this because, on the face of it, we have a straw man that has just been created by the honourable member for Kooyong.

         On the one hand, there is no question about the integrity of Mr Codd or Mr Maxwell. There is no instance that can be pointed to by the opposition whereby these gentlemen have ever compromised themselves professionally or in any way whatsoever. We are told that they are men of integrity. Then we are told about the possibility of conflicts that might arise where they might have been too close to the situation or where Mr Codd might have to sit in judgment on some of his actions. Indeed if that is the case then, as is acknowledged by the honourable member for Kooyong, these are men of integrity.

         When a conflict arises, if it arises, that is when the point should be made about adjudicating on one's own actions, not on the possibility. I understand what the honourable member for Kooyong is saying. However, I think it is a straw man. There is no question about the integrity of these gentlemen. If a point is properly made before them, then I think the honourable member for Kooyong will concede—I am sure he will, given the glowing terms that are used about these individuals—that if they are shown properly before the inquiry to have a conflict of interest or a problem in relation to their past experiences, then they will be judged on their actions at the time as to how they adjudicate. They will be judged on the quality of their report.

The most recent example that we had in this parliament was the inquiry into the so-called sports rorts affair. Surely members of the community would have concerns about members of the Liberal Party of Australia, members of the National Party of Australia, members of particular political parties, sitting in judgment on someone of a different political persuasion, and also members of the Australian Labor Party sitting in judgment on a fellow member of the ALP.

         We should not be living in glass houses. The report of that committee, before it was introduced into the parliament, was seriously brought into question by members of the opposition. What happened? The report was without criticism once it was introduced into the parliament and, in effect, it led to the resignation of a minister. The chairman, whose weights were put up by members of the opposition as to whether he was up to it and whether he would adjudicate or whatever, was shown to have acted impeccably.

         That is the problem that we have here. As someone with a legal background, I understand the concerns that the honourable member for Kooyong is raising, but the same can be said of the Senate. I find it incredible that members of the Senate—and I was not a member of parliament back then—were sitting in judgment on a former senator, the late Justice Lionel Murphy, and conducting an inquiry about him. The same thing could have been said about that. So I think we need to get it into perspective because in all these inquiries, in all these reports, the report stands or falls on its merits, on whether the report can be sustained by the evidence and on the way that the members conduct themselves.

But these are people whom the opposition regards as people of impeccable character. There is no attack on their professionalism, nor can there be, because they have got a demonstrated and proven record. What we have is a possibility that there could be a problem. I have to say that it has not been demonstrated that they have got a particular axe to grind, as members of parliament might have a particular axe to grind when they sit in judgment on their peers in parliamentary inquiries or when the Senate sits in judgment of its peers or pursues naked political inquiries in relation to areas where there obviously is no expertise.

I just say to honourable members opposite that we need to be very careful because what we are seeking here, if we accept the propositions, is a different standard from what we ourselves apply. I do not think that we, as a parliament, can properly conduct an inquiry if we accept what the honourable member for Kooyong has said. It means that no ALP member can sit on any inquiry concerning another member with that same political affiliation, or that no Liberal Party should be able to sit in judgment against a Liberal Party member. The reason I have flown so widely in the debate is that I am arguing the general principles.

         Subsection 34(1) of the Act precludes the Inspector-General and his or her staff from disclosing or communicating any information which they obtained because they held one of these positions, except in the performance of duties and the exercise of powers under the Act.

         Subsection 34(5) of the Act provides that the Inspector-General or his or her staff are not required to produce to a Court any document of which the person has custody or to which the person has had access by reason of having held one of the relevant offices in a court or to divulge or communicate any information. A "court" is defined so as to include an inquiry such as the present one. However, this provision does not give the Inspector-General any discretion about providing information; it simply provides a defence to a person in the relevant class who would otherwise be required by a court or some other legal process to provide such evidence.

        They are the subsections. Basically, the effect of these provisions is that the inspector-general may not properly disclose information or give documents to the inquiry. So what this bill is about is removing this difficulty by permitting the current and former inspectors-general, and the current and former staff of the office of the inspector-general, to give information and evidence to the commissions of inquiry conducted by the Hon. Gordon Samuels and Mr Michael Codd without risking prosecution. In that way, it will ensure that the commissioners have access to a class of information which would be among the most relevant available. I think that is not a bad start and that is what we are actually debating here today. That is what we need to get back to: what are the deficiencies of what the government is proposing before the parliament?

         What happened in the Senate was that the legislation achieved cross-party support. The opposition parties did not come in with any amendments that say what has been put in is deficient; they are not proposing any amendments to the parliament today. What is happening is that we have this straw man that is created. As I say, on the face of it, the honourable member for Kooyong makes an impassioned plea—I do not know whether he is a member of Actors Equity. But in the same breath he cuts away the arguments that he is putting, in effect, because of the character references that he does give to those people. If the situation does arise, as the honourable member for Kooyong suggests, that there is a conflict of interest I have every confidence—just on the material that he said and just on the character evidence that he has given—that these gentlemen will not compromise themselves or the inquiry. That is what we need to get in its proper perspective.

         —in reply—I agree with the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and respond to the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). Putting aside the delightful rhetoric and hyperbole that is the signature of the honourable member for Kooyong, he made three points that deserve a response. The first two related to what might be described as standards that he seeks to impose on the qualification of royal commissioners. I agree with the honourable member for Banks that really the standards that the honourable member for Kooyong wishes to impose are so impossibly high that it would be likely, in these circumstances, we would never find a royal commissioner within Australia.

         The first gentleman that he seeks to disqualify is Mr Michael Codd, on the basis that he was so closely associated with the government's presiding over the intelligence service that that in itself disqualifies him from serving as a commissioner because he may in due course effectively be required to judge his own performance.

         As the honourable member for Banks so sensibly pointed out, this is flawed logic in the extreme. The honourable member for Kooyong said—and he repeated it three times, as I heard him—that Mr Codd is a man of unquestionable integrity. It follows that if the man is of unquestionable integrity, as he is, and he finds himself at any point in a position of conflict of interest, then such a man would immediately disqualify himself.

         Not only that, but Mr Codd is a man of vast experience in government. He has vast experience about matters such as royal commissions and he would never take on a commission if he believed that in any shape or form there was a conflict of interest, either existing or potential. So I think the fact that Mr Codd has accepted the commission is a pretty strong indication to all of us that no conflict exists and, if it did, then he would immediately disqualify himself.

He also, I might add, is eminently qualified to pronounce upon questions of ministerial accountability.

         So far as Mr Maxwell is concerned, he has no current involvement with intelligence matters. Indeed, he is a member of the Victorian bar. He was a member of Senator Evans's staff when Senator Evans was the Attorney. It would have been unlikely that Mr Maxwell would have had much, if any, contact with ASIS as ASIS was in a different portfolio at the time. Senator Evans told the estimates committee on 18 March that he had little continuing contact with Mr Maxwell and that he had not spoken to Mr Maxwell about the latter's appointment as a counsel assisting, although he had put his name forward as a possible appointee. So I do not think there are matters for concern there.

         Whether or not Australia needs to be involved in intelligence activities is a matter for the government of the day. The policy of this government, and also the policy of the government of which the honourable member for Kooyong was a member, has been to have an intelligence agency dedicated to the collection of foreign intelligence overseas. The need for such a body has, if anything, increased as the international environment has become more complex. This inquiry is directed in large part to ensuring that ASIS is accountable for its actions and that it is not—it never has been—above the law.

The Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) endorsed the remarks of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who made great play of equating this judicial inquiry with a parliamentary committee on the question of conflict of interest. Such an equation is erroneous.

         The question of conflict of interest raised by the honourable member for Banks in response to the points I made about Mr Codd in particular are, in my view, distinct. The point is that a likely conflict of interest with a judicial inquiry is avoidable by the appointment of a person to conduct or assist in the judicial inquiry. One chooses a person whom one believes will not have a conflict of interest. With a parliamentary committee, one cannot. With a parliamentary committee, there has to be members from the divided parties—all parties represented in the parliament. One is avoidable and one is not. The length of time that was spent on this was, to me, quite fatuous.

        Mr Acting Speaker, as you would be aware, these propositions are to permit the government to introduce new business after the normal closure under the new arrangements at 8 o'clock tonight. The government would also have, if this is carried, the permission of the House to sit this evening indefinitely. This, of course, would not necessarily be the government's intention, but that would be the effect of the passing of these propositions. This is not at all abnormal for this period in the sittings.

         —Come off it! The honourable member knows it is not. In fact, we operated for most of last year with this standing order virtually permanently suspended. So, if carried, whilst this motion will ensure that there is one disturbed night for members of parliament, it will be the only one in this block of sittings. The Senate today decided to sit through until, I think, 10.30 or 11 o'clock tonight, in order for it to be able to consider legislation that we have passed to it. Some of that legislation will need to return during the day. What this proposition does is give us the flexibility to deal with that legislation when it comes here in order for us to, if necessary, send it back to the Senate or to accept it. The Senate having agreed to do that, it would be obviously churlish of us to decide that we should still maintain our sitting pattern for the remainder of this day. Hopefully, the result of all this will be that we will not have to sit tomorrow and we will be able to conclude the business of this sitting period, the first sitting period of an experimental three-sitting-period year.

Two days ago the Leader of the House told the caucus that we were going to be sitting tonight; he did not have the courtesy to inform the rest of the parliament that we were going to have to sit tonight.

I do not know what he would run in private enterprise. It is a good thing he keeps his job here because it is the only place he would get one. If he were to try to manage even a very small business—those I represent—at the end of the week he would find he could not do it. At the end of a week or 10 days the thing would be in such confusion that no-one would know whether they had to come to work.

It is not that they do not get a chance to come in here on the roster—they are gone. They are falling over like ninepins. Gough Whitlam's reputation has been saved.

We have all heard what Senator Walsh has had to say. At least he did the taxpayer the decency of retiring at an election. But he has been saying plenty since. He is totally disillusioned with the way the government is running the country. The government gets a pragmatist like Senator Richardson who looks at the health industry, knows the problems we have got, can see them staring at him, tries to tell the government how to fix it; and the government tells him to run away. The government will not accept those sorts of issues. Consequently, Senator Richardson has said, `I've had enough'. It is not his health he is worried about; it is the government's health policy. The government gave him a responsibility and he could not do anything about it.

We recollect when he was part of the revolving door of opposition health spokesmen during his brief period of service in that position. He has never been tested in government. He has been tested in opposition—the easiest of all possible tasks to do something reasonable—and has been judged by his colleagues, not by the electorate, as an absolute failure.

         There is no incompetent management of the House entailed here. It is simply this: there is another chamber, which is called the Senate. Members of that chamber are elected according to a basis of proportional representation and equality of the states. Therefore, it produces a different outcome from the House of Representatives. As a result, senators do from time to time, when they consider materials submitted to them from the House of Representatives, decide to make amendments. As a result of those amendments, there is a requirement for those bills to come back to the House for further consideration.

         If we were not to sit tonight, I suppose we could keep up the hours; we could meet tomorrow, the next day and the day after that, but the honourable member for O'Connor would say that would be terribly inconvenient because he has made appointments. We cannot do anything to accommodate him in that area. No doubt if we had suggested sitting tomorrow, he would have got up and said, `How inconvenient of you, I have arranged appointments back in O'Connor'. That would be a change. Appointments in O'Connor would be a considerable rarity for the honourable member. He spends most of his time defending Labor Party members in the metropolitan parts of Western Australia. He has the good sense to live in my electorate, so he has the pleasure of living in my electorate while he provides me with opportunities to be re-elected.

         The honourable member for O'Connor was dissatisfied with my returning at the last election, and I now know some of the reasons for his solicitude. He does not think I would do all that well in small business, which disappoints me a little. I thought the reason he did me favours in the past was that he thought I was such a competent minister. I guess I will have to revise that view. Not only has he done me favours, but he is now doing favours for the new honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). As I said before, we always take seriously the views of the honourable member for O'Connor. How could we not take seriously the views of a chap who has been so helpful?

         The proposal to be referred to the Standing Committee on Public Works is for the construction of a chancellery and an official residence. Future developments proposed include the construction of 12 apartments and some recreation facilities to replace present overcrowded and unsuitable premises. The construction will be on a site leased long term by the Australian government in the area which is becoming the diplomatic part of the city.

          The main elements of the proposal are a four-level chancellery building, including a basement, and a two-level head of mission residence. Proposed future development comprises a three- and a five-level residential block, including basements, together totalling 12 residential apartments; recreational facilities, comprising a swimming pool, multi-purpose court and squash court; and staff and visitor parking. The design has regard to climate and local building practices and is based on simple low-rise buildings.

          The principal consultants are Australian. A managing contractor with significant Australian connections will be appointed to work closely with the consultants and development team during the design phase and will then be responsible for the construction phase of the project. Local materials and building technology will be used where possible, but where imported materials and equipment are required emphasis will be given to importing items of Australian origin. The estimated cost of the chancellery and head of mission residence project is $15.919 million at February 1994 prices. There will be no impact on the budget, as funds from the sale of properties in Singapore will cover the cost of the project. I table the plans of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House.

          —The opposition does not oppose in any sense the reference to the Standing Committee on Public Works of the proposal to build an embassy complex in Hanoi. Anyone who has been to Hanoi appreciates only too well the difficult conditions in which Australian diplomats and associated staff have been required to live for quite some years. Clearly there is a need now to consider a long-term investment in Hanoi, in terms of both Australia's future diplomatic relations with Vietnam and the trade implications.

          I am, however, somewhat concerned at the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca) that the costing of this project will be funded, at least in part, from the sale of property in Singapore. Members of the House perhaps would not be aware that the proposal in fact is to sell the high commissioner's residence in Singapore, which would have to be one of the great buildings of the island. It is an outstanding example of the period known as the Raj in Singapore. There is significant additional space in the allotment, which on my last visit there two years ago I thought could have been put to better use.

          I regard the sale of that building with some genuine concern, because the likelihood is that in due course the Australian ambassador will live in a block of flats. I think that would be a very sad thing. The building is very significant to Australia's historic relations with Singapore. I think there will be a loss to Australia's image in that country as a result of the decision to sell the building for the construction of other types of accommodation.

          —by leave—The report which has just been tabled is the first national inquiry into violence in Australian schools. The committee received evidence from each state and territory and from the public and private education sectors. The committee believes that schools must be managed so that children can learn in a safe and happy school environment without fear of emotional and physical abuse. Teachers also have the right to work in an environment free from violence and intimidation. While some violent incidents cannot be prevented, the committee saw many examples of schools operating in a manner that ensured that violence was an isolated and infrequent occurrence.

          It is easy to form the view that violence is a regular feature of school life. There are regular media reports of violent acts in schools which give the impression that our school systems are in chaos. They are not. We found that schools do provide a safe learning environment for most children free from emotional and physical abuse. Indeed, in some areas, rather than being places of violence, schools are havens and places of safety in contrast to the violence which exists within the wider community. In New South Wales, for example, children are 50 times less likely to be assaulted inside a school than they are in the wider community. And while some people are disappointed that we chose not to pursue those individual and isolated instances of violence which attract so much media attention, we decided to dwell on and examine approaches and practices in schools where violence is rare or non-existent.

          Every child and every teacher has a right to work in a safe environment where students' learning outcomes are accorded the highest priority. The committee believes that poor student behaviour can be managed. We saw many schools where strong leadership and commitment by principals and teachers to effecting change had succeeded in altering children's behaviour patterns. Schools were successful when teachers and other school personnel provided positive role models, when schools developed a positive rather than punitive approach to discipline, when schools adopted a positive and inclusive curriculum addressing the needs of all students and when parents and communities made a positive contribution to the development of school behaviour policies.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There was a high incident of bullying reported to the committee. We were told that surveys in one system showed that between one in four and one in seven students are bullied each week and five per cent of students are bullies. As many as 20 per cent of the school population say that they play truant or would if they could because they feel unsafe at school. There is no data to indicate whether this is an increase or decrease on previous instances. No child should be subject to bullying and it must be within the power of schools to prevent it.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           There are many programs which address school violence. These are directed at students, teachers and parents. The reports on the effectiveness of these programs and approaches are, however, largely anecdotal. We have recommended that the government conduct an evaluation of these programs to ensure that the most effective are supported and adopted in our schools.
          </tab>
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We also believe that it is difficult to evaluate programs without a clear understanding of the level and nature of violence in our schools. Existing studies are limited to parts of some states. A well designed and coordinated national survey would provide comprehensive and comparable data allowing for the assessment of effective preventive measures  for use nationally. The committee believes that there is a link between low literacy levels, low self-esteem and children who perpetrate violence. In our previous report,
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           The literacy challenge
          </emphasis>
          , we stated that a basic grounding in literacy skills is an absolute prerequisite for later learning. The committee recommended that early education be better resourced. We continue to hold that view.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Commonwealth spends $2.7 billion a year on schools education, so we believe that we have an entitlement to develop a national strategy that includes all Australian children. Such increased funding for literacy would not only allow for literacy to be developed; it would also allow for the development and introduction of other early intervention programs and strategies to address behaviour and socialisation issues. Indeed, we received submissions from the Australian Psychologists Association and others which suggested that behaviour cannot be modified after age eight. We would simply ask: why then as a community do we spend a fortune on locking up children, suggesting that all manner of programs should be developed? After all, it costs us $40,000 a year to keep someone in gaol. What could we do with that kind of money in years 1 to 3 in the education system and hopefully keep them and the traumas that are suffered by them as individuals and the community in general out?

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We also again draw attention to the fact that children in Australia are funded $3,000 per year in primary schools, $4,000 in secondary schools and $10,000 plus in the tertiary sector. Surely this is an enormous imbalance. It needs to be addressed in this, the International Year of the Family.

          Many other witnesses considered the portrayal of violence by the media and entertainment industries to be an influence on the level of violence. The committee has recommended that the government undertake national research which would examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. We believe that the media and entertainment industries have a clear responsibility to examine the use of violent, aggressive and inappropriate behaviours and to promote non-violent behaviour and positive values in order to counter the current pervasive view that violence is acceptable and a normal part of life.

          The role of parents and families is undoubtedly the greatest influence on children's lives. Behaviour and values are appropriately modelled and taught in the home environment. However, the committee recognises the enormous pressures on some families and the consequent inability of some parents to provide the support necessary for the development of children's social and behavioural skills.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The committee has proposed that in this International Year of the Family the government establish in each state and territory pilot programs on positive parenting. It is essential that governments respond to the needs of families so that all children receive the support necessary for success in the school environment. We have found some quite extraordinary indications of state resources and state organisations looking after children. We found that one child was subject to 17 different organisations. Surely there is a need for us as a government and a community to focus on the child and the family and to recognise that violence in schools is part of all of that.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We would also say, yet again, that no level of violence in schools is acceptable. It must be recognised that it is possible for all schools to be safe and happy places for all students. It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that schools are adequately resourced to enable this to happen. We examined one program which, over a three-year period, cost $120,000 and assisted 154 children who ran the risk of becoming juvenile delinquents. While the cost might appear high, had those children found their way into the prison system, it would, on average, represent a cost of nearly $7 million to maintain them for a year.

          The committee is arguing that governments must seize the opportunity presented in the earliest years of schooling and put in place preventive programs and strategies which will ultimately reduce levels of violence, both in our schools and our communities, thus reducing the overall cost of detention. On behalf of the committee and the members who are here today to support me, I thank all those who have contributed to our inquiry through their submissions or attendance at the extensive program of public meetings, public hearings, visits, inspections and discussions. I also thank the secretariat of John Cummins, Bronwyn Allan and Kerry Warner for their terrific work and support over the period. I commend the report to the House.

          </emphasis>
          is a report on violence in Australian schools. It is not a report on barbed wire and razor wire to surround schools, surveillance systems or armed policemen in our institutes of learning. In that regard, I have to say that the committee received one submission in South Australia from a teachers' union group which was stomped on quite comprehensively by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick). I commend him in that regard.

          This is a benign report in that we do not make many recommendations nor do we find that violence is, as sometimes portrayed in the media, a major, significant national Australian problem. The committee, while unable to obtain statistics, did reach the conclusion on anecdotal evidence that, on balance, physical violence in schools is probably decreasing but bullying is probably increasing. In that regard we need to address the major issues surrounding violence and see how we as a community can help improve our current situation.

          The media certainly has a strong influence on this issue. We read in the press blown up articles of incidents which do happen unfortunately from time to time in schools. Sometimes we think the community concludes that our schools are dangerous places for children to go. On the contrary, the committee found that most schools are safe havens, and so they should be. This report into violence deals with violence in schools, not with violence in the broader community. The committee, on balance, felt that we were not qualified to report on the whole issue across all of society and all of the problems society has. So, while not disregarding evidence from the broader community, the effects of violence on the broader community and how that impacts on the school environment, nonetheless, we have confined our report to the school location.

          In essence, I believe that I learned three major things during this inquiry. The first is that most teachers believe that those who commit physical violence lack self-esteem. We clearly know from our last report into early childhood literacy development that low self-esteem and low literacy skills go hand in hand. I conclude that if we address the literacy problem and try to fix it for young children in primary school, then we will have some effect on reducing violence in the school environment and probably in the broader community as well—not a total fix, but that we can have some impact.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second thing I learned which I believe is of significance is that over the past two decades, as permissive society has developed, we have increasingly given children their rights, but in the absence of parental discipline, structures of dos and don'ts, children have been left to flounder without direction and experience in how to take responsibility for their own actions and deal responsibly with their peers and with the broader community. That is a substantive problem.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In some sense I believe that the community is coming to a realisation that the age of permissiveness is drawing to an end. We as a society are going to say that we need to impose some restriction. Once again, we need to examine individually our responsibilities to each other as well as our responsibilities to society in preference to only examining our rights, because each right that we take takes away some right from our neighbour. There is a need within the school system to replace the age-old parental dos and don'ts with a system that helps children learn how to deal with their frustrations, unhappiness and the difficulties that they face in their own lives without resorting to violence and bullying.

          The third major thing that I learned during this inquiry was that there are models of school practice which generally exhibit strong leadership and a whole school approach which creates a culture of caring that negates both violence and bullying. In that regard, the Mayfield Primary School in Launceston, Tasmania, was an absolute gem of a model in how schools might progress even in a socio-economically disadvantaged area and without additional resources—without one extra dollar—to deal with the twin problems of literacy and violence, including bullying.

          There is a danger that we could become a more violent society, but schools can and should play a positive and preventive role to reverse any such trends. I think there is a fear in the broader community, based somewhat on the violence that we see on television, in videos, in video games and through the media's portrayal of violence in schools, that we are headed down the path that would lead us to the sort of violent confrontationist school society that we see depicted in the United States. All of us would decry any such situation in Australia. I believe there are positive mechanisms that we put forward in this report which can help address that situation.

          It would be remiss of me if I did not thank all the members of the committee for enduring a long campaign, in terms of addressing this issue and discussing the issue with the many respondents all over Australia. Certainly, my greatest thanks go to the committee secretariat, made up of John Cummins, Bronwyn Allan and Kerry Warner. Their work was indeed invaluable. I, like the committee's chairman, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), commend the report to the House.

          —by leave—I am delighted to speak to this report, albeit briefly. This report has generated quite a deal of emotive press throughout the country and has tended to highlight the negative aspects of the submissions presented to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This is what we have come to expect from the press in Australia, and it has not let us down. When we talk about violence in schools, we need to realise that violence is but a symptom—an unacceptable expression of anger and frustration—that arises from deep-seated behavioural problems that exist currently in our society. Our inquiry dealt specifically with violence in schools, and the report states:

         During our inquiry it became obvious that schools can be and are being properly managed so that children of all ages are able to learn in a safe and happy environment free from emotional and physical abuse. Unfortunately, by the time many of our children enter schools they are already at risk. There is little currently being done due to the cutback in resources to primary schools, both in Liberal and Labor states, to ensure that these children's problems are being addressed.

          Early intervention programs that are in operation throughout Australia are tangible proof of just how successful we can be in circumventing the inevitable spiral of antisocial behaviour. Unfortunately, bureaucrats within the education departments in the states, and many politicians—both federal and state—are more impressed with what is happening at tertiary institutions than with trying to understand the impact apparent in early childhood and early intervention programs where teachers are imparting values and setting a climate for future learning. We do not see the value of this program until 10 years down the track.

          These early intervention programs do have a dramatic effect on changing the culture. These types of programs provide not only the young parents but also their children with a wide range of skills that they would ordinarily not possess by the time they enter their local primary school. These programs also enable the parent and child to participate in a caring and less formal environment where the teachers in attendance are able to discuss problems with parents, identify potential problems, and bring in the necessary expertise and resources to address those problems before they become unmanageable and result in greater social dislocation and greater cost to society.

          Some states and territories appear to be most successful in addressing the problem of violence in schools, particularly in South Australia and the ACT where schools take an interagency approach to the problem of violence and anti-social behaviour. Through an interagency approach, the solution also lies in the provision of more adequate housing, more responsive and better targeted community services, better transport and more widespread recreational facilities for not only children but also their families.

          —by leave—I crave the indulgence of the House for a few minutes. I support the remarks of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), and of the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). What came out most clearly in the whole exercise was that there is a definite differentiation between violence and bullying in schools. Nevertheless, we should not rest easy on our laurels thinking that somehow, under the old boys school type atmosphere, `bullying strengthens the man'. Quite clearly, it does not. Quite clearly, it imposes stresses and strains on both teachers and students. From a South Australian study, we found that, as a result of bullying, 20 per cent of students felt unsafe at school and another 16 per cent had a regular pattern of truancy. This shows that bullying is an item of major impact. Also, as both my colleagues have said, the lack of self-esteem in students is becoming a major problem.

          I would draw attention to one particular school that had the most profound effect on me; it was the Patrician Brothers in the western suburbs of Sydney. It is an old school with asphalted courtyards located, in some respects, in a socially deprived area, with 76 per cent of its students coming from an ethnic background. Yet there was little or no violence in that school. There was a very caring attitude taken not only by the brothers but by the whole teaching establishment, with a system of pastoral care and a `no hands' policy between the students. I remember putting the question to a group I spoke to: `Why is it that you do not have the violence here that we have seen in other schools?'. They said, `We are family'. I thought that was a very interesting comment to come from young people. I would commend that school for the work it has done and as a role model for other secondary schools to follow.

          Some of the recommendations in the report which no doubt will be canvassed at a later stage in this House require some attention. One is for ongoing identification of the effects of television, video games and such like on children; the role models that young people play need to be examined in some depth. We also found that there is a great lack of accurate data on which to make assessments. With literacy, although there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, we could not really tie that down. But there needs to be a database with information pooled together by state and federal authorities on this matter of violence; and that is a recommendation we have made to the minister.

         The Senate amendment is not acceptable for five basic reasons. The amendment would provide an additional member of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to be nominated by an organisation or organisations representing veterans. The bill has already been amended to provide for a Defence Force representative on the commission. The present 10-member composition of the commission is designed to represent employers, unions and government; an additional member to represent the veteran community would be inconsistent with this intention. Acceptance of the proposed additional member is likely to lead to pressure for other groups to be represented, which would not only disturb the existing balance in the commission's membership but also make its size somewhat unwieldy and inefficient.

         —If the coalition remains opposed to the modified approach by the government, it at least observes that the government is now recognising, by its amendment on an amendment, that reference ought to be made to the interests of members and former members of the Defence Force in the Military Compensation Bill. It got that much correct. But then, in going about the furtherance of that, it has now decided that somehow the member representing the serving members of the Defence Force should be the only one and there should not be any additional personage—although it would only create an 11th position on the particular commission in question.

         On a more serious note, neither of us is distracted from the matter before the House by other events. We acknowledge that there may be some merit in explicit legislative recognition of the interests of former as well as serving members of the Defence Force. We think the reformulation—what we are proposing—is the way to go rather than adding another body to the commission. It is a slight difference of opinion. It is one which the Leader of the National Party, particularly bearing in mind his background, feels quite strongly about. But I stress to the House that this legislation should be seen in no way as anything other than an enhancement of veterans and veterans' rights. It is simply the means of doing this with which we differ with the honourable gentleman opposite.

         —It has to be said at once that the interim report from the Australian Law Reform Commission is both a significant and an important report. It is a response to terms of reference put forward by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), which called for an interim report by 31 December 1993, a date which was extended to the end of March this year. The report contains evidence from the commission that there is a grave social problem in relation to women's access to the legal system. It is perhaps a problem that is not unknown since other inquiries are currently in train which deal with related matters.

         One such inquiry, dealing with gender bias in the judiciary—a subject that gained some prominence in the media last year—is being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The terms of reference of that inquiry ask whether the publicity that surrounded judicial comments made in sex cases was a proper reflection of a failure by the judiciary to understand gender issues. That is really a very small issue compared with the subject matter of this report.

         The Law Reform Commission invited public submissions from those involved in what might be referred to, in general terms, as domestic violence. From its report, the commission has plainly been overwhelmed by the response. This is disturbing. In recent years there have been inquiries into the attitudes of males and females towards domestic violence. The results of those surveys are equally disturbing. It is inconceivable that a substantial part of the community is prepared to accept that violence inflicted by a man on his wife or by a man on his partner is acceptable conduct in this day and age.

         As I said, the public response to the commission's inquiry has been overwhelming. The result is that the commission is recommending urgent action, even before it has got to the stage of submitting a final report. The evidence that is presented justifies such a response, although what is proposed may be open to debate. However, the difficulties of overcoming the obstacles identified by the commission in the administration of justice in particular ought not to be underestimated. The difficulties arise, in many respects, not out of inadequacies of the system but out of the attitudes of the community. We are dealing with a problem that has to be solved at grassroots level.

         It is true that there is among women a lack of awareness of the law and of legal services. The commission identified that obstacle and something can probably be done about that. It is also true, as the commission asserts, that many police lack an awareness of women's needs and experiences. However, the difficulty, which is not confronted by the criticisms on those two points, is that the attitude of the community is in part reflected by the conduct of those involved.

         Another fundamental difficulty is revealed by other obstacles identified by the commission. When a woman is bashed and she seeks help, there is an understandable reluctance on the part of anybody outside the family or the relevant home to get involved in what is seen as a domestic dispute. This reluctance is supported when there is a conflict in the evidence from those involved. The commission highlights a number of situations where a woman has made a report, the husband or partner has contradicted the report offered by the woman and as a consequence there is a reluctance on the part of the police or any other person in authority to get involved.

         That reluctance, I think, can in part be overcome by proper training of those involved in the investigation of domestic violence complaints. However, retraining police and establishing special task forces to deal with this particular aspect of the problem will only assist if quite significant resources are devoted to it. Those resources would have to come from state and territory governments rather than from the Commonwealth.

         One obstacle identified by the commission, which I must say I find somewhat surprising, is that legal service providers—solicitors, community legal service advisers and the like—fail to provide accurate and appropriate assistance. This problem, I suspect, is not caused so much by the skill of the legal service providers to handle the situation presented to them. It would be outside the desired experience of most busy suburban general practitioners of the law to be confronted with a woman who claims to have been bashed but who has no resources to finance the taking of appropriate action. It may also be difficult for the busy suburban legal practitioner if the woman presents in an unhappy, uncommunicative state. That difficulty, to the extent that it is a real one, ought to be overcome by the identification and appropriate publicity of the availability of specialist advisers in this particular area.

         It will not, however, overcome the question of who is going to pay the legal costs involved. Legal aid funds are drying up.

Without the proper provision of community legal services that problem will be insuperable.

         The big problem, one which is not going to be easily addressed by any report—this report or any other number of reports that might address this situation—is how to deal with a domestic situation in which there is a desire on the part of both parties that the relationship continue but the conduct of one or more partners be reformed.

         One example of the importance of this issue within the community is demonstrated by the current inquiry being conducted by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which is focusing on the operation of the Child Support Agency. Last year the committee set up a hotline and invited anybody with a concern relating to the operation of the child support scheme to telephone a nominated number within Parliament House. The response was absolutely overwhelming. There were tens of thousands of calls recorded on each of the two days it was operating. In fact, only some 700 of the calls could be answered. The problems that were raised in the course of that little exercise on the part of the joint select committee were symptomatic of the sorts of problems that were covered in the hundreds of submissions provided in writing and in the oral evidence given at the committee's public hearings.

         Before concluding and saying that the work of the Law Reform Commission ought to be very strongly supported and without going into any comment on the detail of the commission report, I urge the commission to deal with the subject as quickly as possible. In order that the report has the greatest possible credibility, I urge the commission also to ensure that everything is done to make sure that the results of the inquiry cannot be challenged. It may necessitate a deliberate attempt on the part of the commission to ensure that all sides of the stories that are told to it are taken and heard. One experience any family law practitioner can relate is that the two versions of the story are rarely the same. In the case of domestic violence, in the absence of tangible evidence the unfortunate situation is that it is generally one word against another.

         It is also important that the commission ensure that those involved in the working out of the final report involve as wide a representation in the community as possible. I do not make the comment idly, but it is significant to note that of the 21 names of participants involved in the work of the commission, listed in the early pages of the book, only two are males. If we are having affirmative action in the preparation of the report it seems to be very affirmative. I commend the report to the House and urge honourable members to read it.

Over recent days, items of news reported in our newspapers have reflected many of the attitudes which we as a society hold—to our shame. The matter-of-fact way in which they are presented by the press and the simple acceptance by the community indicate that as a nation we are prepared to accept that women do not have equal rights.

         I will mention just a few cases. The body of a 14-year-old girl was dumped in a drain near Lake Macquarie. She was not identified for days until her grandfather in the central west of New South Wales recognised the post-mortem photograph published in the newspaper. She was a Kings Cross street kid. A man who killed a prostitute in his car was acquitted of a murder charge but found guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter, claiming that the dead woman had pulled a knife on him. But he dumped her body and fled the scene.

         Crimes such as these are commonplace. Violence against women is nothing new. A police raid on brothels in Newcastle last weekend resulted in the charging of all women involved and their full names, ages and addresses being published.

         I mention these examples because they highlight the attitudes that exist towards women and the ways in which the women in our society are victimised. I do not draw any distinction whatsoever between women who are prostitutes and any other women. All women are members of our society and therefore they have the right to equality. If one woman is disempowered because of her gender, all women are disempowered. I do not think newspaper reporters, police officers or ordinary members of the community are deliberately conspiring to disempower women. Gender bias is more a problem of awareness.

         I also appreciate that police officers are often at the front-line of assistance in situations of domestic violence. It is not an easy situation to handle, and the overriding consideration is to restore harmony in the family situation as quickly as possible by calming down the aggressor, generally the male. To do this, pressure is often placed on the female victim not to press charges and withdraw a complaint. Pressure can also be applied by advising the female victim of the unpleasantness of swearing statements, attending court hearings, and being denied access to her children, if the judge so rules. In the end, the woman gives up. There is an obvious need for consideration to be given to the role of police in domestic violence situations—if indeed they are the appropriate or sole agency for enforcement—and the mandatory training required.

         While these submissions were drawn from women representing a wide range of backgrounds, they really only touched the fringe. Unfortunately, time prevented a fully comprehensive study. The only public hearing held in New South Wales was in Sydney. People in my electorate could have supplied another carton of evidence. Only recently, a domestic violence court support worker, Vicki King, exposed the desperate plight of women and children who are the victims of domestic violence in the Maitland area. Vicki's position was funded as part of the national strategy on violence against women to raise awareness of this problem. She did her job well. She exposed a terrible story of fear and brutality which is widespread in the community. Having identified this problem, we as a government cannot wash our hands of it. We cannot distance ourselves.

         This report of the Law Reform Commission is timely. Our legal system denies women proper recourse to the most fundamental right of protection for themselves and their children. The obstacles that they face in getting access to justice are well chronicled in the report. One of these obstacles is that women are unaware of their rights and the way the legal system works. I suggest that women are unaware of these matters only because we have failed to make them aware. The commission has not shied away from the humiliating evidence that men have constructed the rules and abused their power.

         The most outstanding recommendation of the Law Reform Commission's report is the call for the immediate establishment of a national women's justice program. The whole tenor of the report speaks eloquently of this urgency. The problem of women's access to the legal aid dollar, of which they receive only 37 per cent, must be addressed. The report shows clearly that legal aid funding in family law must be re-examined. I strongly support the measures suggested to increase women's access to legal representation in court, such as changing our legal aid priorities, increasing legal aid for private lawyers and funding community based services to represent women.

Women suffer violence, sexual assault, discrimination in employment and have less access to financial resources. We must honour our international human rights obligations. Court facilities must be improved, and the report makes several worthy recommendations, such as the provision of child care and protection for women while they are in court so that they do not have to confront their abusers because there are no separate waiting rooms.

It is a thorough, encompassing document, but it is also an indictment of discrimination of our legal system and its failure to provide accurate and appropriate assistance. It is an indictment of the police service for its lack of awareness of the needs and experiences of women. It raises the totally unacceptable issue that the most basic right of justice has failed. Women are bitterly disillusioned with the law, with the court environment and the attitudes of the legal profession. Any society which has allowed these injustices to exist should take immediate action to correct them. It is especially imperative that a society such as ours, which cherishes the rights of all its citizens, take immediate action.

         The report considers a number of areas, as I see it, the first being the question of access to justice and the degree to which in our society, to use the words of a committee report last year, in many respects women, although constituting slightly more than half of the Australian population, are still only halfway to equal. The degree to which women have access to the processes that are freely available to men is true not only of the law but of a whole range of facilities.

         In the financial world, for example, many women are disadvantaged because of the degree to which they are not treated as having the same creditworthiness as other members. If they produce securities in their own name, then they are accepted as equal. But, if they present in some way securities relating to their own position as only recent entrants to the work force or as members of a wider family group, they are not given the same accord as men in our society. So access, not just to legal services but generally, is a very important problem.

         Although the report is specifically directed to women, there is another group in the community which perhaps is even more disadvantaged. Although children are mentioned in passing in this report, I would have thought it was appropriate that we look at them at the same time. Children are an even more fragile sector of our society. Many of them have no status in courts at all. When they give evidence or appear in court, the extent to which they are dependent upon an adult prejudices the degree to which their own point of view is accepted and registered and the degree to which their interests are allowed to be processed. I see the role of the three participating structural human groups, if I can describe it in that way, in our society as being of equal importance. In my view, women should at least be as equal as men and children should at least be as equal as women and men.

         Unfortunately, we are not looking sufficiently at the degree to which age, as well as sex, is a factor in determining equality of access and equality before the law. From my perusal of this report, age does not really get sufficient mention. There is mention of young women, but women as children and children of either sex are essentially even more vulnerable. I think that is an area which could well have had greater emphasis because, to my mind, that group is the most vulnerable of all of those in our society.

         We all know that children are our future. We all know that through today's children tomorrow's society will be formed. Without the strength of a society allowing for the protection of those future generations, the very fabric of society itself is prejudiced. I am concerned about the degree to which the age of women is dealt with in the report, in that it talks about young women instead of about children as well as women as such.

         Along with access, there are other dimensions to the problem. Violence is obviously one. The extent to which violence is applicable to women more than to men is a major problem and the extent to which remedies are available is important. I mentioned access to financial resources through my reference to the banks. It is also important that we look at that not just in terms of legal aid because there should be a capacity through our normal systems for women to enjoy the same access as men.

         There is also a real problem with the structure of our society and the degree to which, within the traditional patterns of society, women are given a role. I mention that because there are two categories of people with which I am particularly familiar and that have long worried me. The first is that of rural and isolated women. Reading stories of the development of this great country of ours leaves no doubt that the contribution of pioneer women was absolutely mind-boggling.

         Many of us have seen some of those reproductions of old homes that the pioneer women lived in. In thinking of the things we take for granted, there are very few Australian homes where power, water and sewerage are not available. Some of those people traversed long distances to get to the place where they essentially lived—first under canvas and perhaps many of them lived even without the protections of the canvas and lived under some sort of bark enclave. They lived without water, without sewerage and without power. There are still enormous difficulties for those who are isolated, not because those facilities are not available today but because they may not have access to facilities which people who live in towns and cities take for granted.

         The Country Women's Association of Australia has for long represented isolated women. Those women do not have the same companionship as those women who live in the city. Their isolation is such that they cannot always enjoy access to other women to talk about their common problems. The telephone, radio and television help, but there is a tendency to forget that in some parts of Australia a local telephone call is not at the standard rate; so using the telephone costs a fortune. Women in remote and isolated areas do not have the same access to ordinary services as those who live in the city. This report mentions women in isolated communities. I think it is important that we understand their position.

         The second category with which I have had particular association, as I guess all of us as politicians in this place have, is that of older women. We are all aware that there is generally a capacity for women to live longer than men and many older women are in a very fragile position in society. They generally tend to still have a family around them, although some tend to be isolated from their families. Many of them do not enjoy friendships that easily with others of a different age group. Of course, as they get older their old friends tend to die or move on. It is a very lonely life for many of those older women. So their access to the law and to society is more difficult. I am glad to see reference to them in this report.

         The third category is women who are Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders or, as an extension of that, relative newcomers to Australia from different ethnic backgrounds. In part, their difficulties are the barrier of language and the barrier of communication. When they are confronted with the legal system, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for them to converse and communicate in order to get their point of view across. The processes of the law do not really take into account those problems. Whether they are isolated women or women without access to the English language, in the normal course they are often significantly disadvantaged.

         Yesterday during members' statements I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) referring to the problems of communication with the Department of Social Sercurity regarding the possible pension entitlement of people in whose country of origin there is now a social security agreement in place. In other words, they have an entitlement to a pension from another country. The difficulty for many of them is that they do not understand the nature in which they can claim that other pension, and they certainly cannot understand an abrupt communication from an Australian government agency saying that unless they take advantage of that pension they are likely to lose their own pension. So they are frightened and put into an even more tender and difficult position.

         Within this report there is identification of some of those more difficult areas of human relationships in our society. I think it is good that it has been developed in this way, but I think it is important that we in the wider community take note that there is a particular challenge for some sectors of women, as distinct from women as a whole. Without doubt there are disabilities for women as a group within Australia, but equally within that there are a number who are particularly disadvantaged and for whose futures many of us worry.

         There are two other aspects to the report to which I want to briefly refer. One is protection of women at court. I think the nature of our male oriented society has disadvantaged people who are in any way vulnerable in a court forum. The rather archaic gowns that are still worn—like the clerks at the table with their gowns and wigs—does make situations a bit difficult in a court framework. As a barrister, I believe the anonymity that the gowns provide is an advantage. In the Family Court they have been given away, and now we have the product of violence against those who sit, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, in an ordinary suit before us; you are treated, as I suspect you should be, as a member of parliament rather than as somebody above it. It is difficult in a Family Court environment, where members of the court are in ordinary rig. Often there is the difficulty of the women who appear before the court feeling a little put off by those formalities and the systems of the court itself.

         I was interested in the reference within the report to protecting women in court and giving them equal access before the law. There is also the question of physical accessibility and the fact that in our society so many women do not enjoy the same mobility as men. As a result, because of their family responsibilities or the background from which they come, they are inhibited in presenting themselves in an equal position to men.

         I commend the report, not as concluding the debate but as opening it. I say to those who are looking at the implementation of the report that I am disappointed that the role of children is not given sufficient emphasis. I think they are at least as fragile as women. Women become women when they are children, not just when they become adults. Often children are in an even more vulnerable position. I think there are problems with violence, and there certainly are problems with access. Regrettably, the issues raised in the

         —Like other members, I welcome this report from the Law Reform Commission. The most effective means that we have for ensuring a just society is for that society to be firmly based on laws that are relevant and protective. The single area where women are most endangered in our society, unfortunately, is violence. Violence is a regular part of the life of a large number of women in Australia.

         One of the main problems is the response of the legal system to domestic violence. When women seek access to the legal system, very often they are seeking protection from violence. This protection from violence cannot be separated from women's equality and their access to justice. We are all well informed on violence. It goes back to school days, when we saw bullying and victimisation. Many members of this House may have been victimised, and perhaps some were the bullies. I am very fortunate. My home life before marriage and now has been totally violence free. Not every woman has been as lucky as I have been.

         The problem is a national one, and many women rightly complain about the lack of uniform standards in the response to violence. Reading the law reform report, we find that women in Cairns do not have the general level of protection that is available in New South Wales and Victoria. In Western Australia there is a lack of police support in domestic violence matters and a general lack of legal services for women.

         In South Australia there is good support from the police but inadequacies in the magistrates court. Amazingly, in Tasmania there are no legal services specifically for women subjected to domestic violence, although some legal aid is available in obtaining restraining orders. In the Northern Territory there is a marked contrast between the quality and the adequacy of services available in Darwin in comparison to the rest of the territory. In towns such as Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, women subjected to violence often have nowhere to go for legal assistance. By contrast, as if I need to mention it, the level of services in Canberra is very high. We are very good at looking after ourselves here in Canberra, however the rest of Australia needs and is entitled to the equal level of services.

         In recent years there have been three major conferences advancing this most desirable goal. In 1992 the General Assembly of the 47th session of the United Nations adopted a recommendation to be contained within the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The recommendation identified gender based violence as a form of discrimination against women that seriously inhibits their ability to enjoy rights and freedom on a basis of equality with men.

         In June 1993 the second conference that I want to mention, the World Conference on Human Rights, was held. At that conference it was declared that gender based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and sexual exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and the worth of the human person and must be eliminated. This can be achieved by legal measures and through national action and international cooperation. The conference, whose work should be known to this House, was the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, which in December 1993 adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women. This declaration calls on all nations to provide access to the mechanisms of justice and to develop appropriate sanctions to redress the wrongs caused to women subjected to violence. What is violence against women? Here is a definition:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . any act of gender based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women; including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Why are women subjected to this sort of event in their lives? United Nations declarations suggest that this behaviour towards women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men. This led to the prevention of women's full advancement. This domination is a crucial social mechanism by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men. Unfortunately, too often this subordination leads to wives, mothers, daughters, sisters and women on the street being bashed.

This recognition is bipartisan, and I am happy to acknowledge the widespread and genuine support on these issues given by members of the coalition. If we are to make real progress in this matter, it will have to be on a bipartisan basis and I for one am always ready and happy to cooperate with all forces to achieve a benefit for the Australian people.

         Part of the response to the problem in the fight against violence has been to establish a National Committee on Violence Against Women. This committee has sought to develop an effective response on a national basis through the development of a national strategy. This strategy remains only poorly effective. The big problem seems to be the limited success so far in achieving parallel standards of access to justice. I am aware that our constitutional and legal framework is one of a federation of states and that this divides the legal response between various jurisdictions. I also know that members of this House are of differing views as to what should be the proper legal balance between the states and the Commonwealth. However, I think that we can all see that there are some issues which indisputably need a uniform national approach. Violence against women and their access to legal redress is surely one of these issues.

         The origins of this report were somewhat controversial. They arose out of widely reported comments in the press by a judge in relation to a case involving a man raping his wife and the judge's view that in the circumstances some force—I am paraphrasing very badly—may have been justified. There were other cases about at the time which drew a great deal of public comment and publicity. These things have been happening for years and years, probably for as long as recorded history, but it is interesting that only recently have they been news. That undoubtedly is as a consequence of a change in attitudes.

         What we are debating in this chamber today is whether we should change attitudes. Clearly, the Law Reform Commission thinks so and also makes some very specific recommendations on how those attitudes may be backed up with some very real action. I have always found the legal profession an interesting one in this sense. If I may be permitted to indulge in just a small personal reminiscence, when I was a high school student my ambition was to go into the law when I left school. I was at school during the 1950s. I was not dissuaded from that by my parents; I was forbidden to do it by my parents on the grounds of the high degree of discrimination against women in the law in those days.

         My father pointed out to me that he had no personal influence whatever with a single member of the legal profession; therefore he would not be able to arrange for me to get the articles that were necessary for me to qualify as a lawyer. My mother pointed out to me that, even if I did qualify, traditionally women in the law were given the dirty work in the firm. She cited to me such things as adultery divorce cases and hinted at other darker things which she did not mention at the time and which I did not know about. I have since come to suspect that she was referring to such things as incest.

         It was, therefore, very interesting to me when I was elected to parliament in 1974 that one of the very early things that I had to make up my own mind on and vote on in the Senate was the Family Law Act. I reflected as I sat in that chamber and made up my own mind, as I voted and made divorce law, how it had not been so very many years before that my parents thought it was unfit for me to practise law because I would have to handle divorce law. I reflected how much attitudes had changed—although not enough, I hasten to add.

         In the course of this debate, which has been very much about violence by men towards women and the legal redress that women have, I thought back on that. It brought to my mind the fact that the old divorce law which the Family Law Act 1975 replaced was a very interesting reflection of its times. It was a law that went back only to the 1960s. It was a law that included the notion of fault. There were several grounds for divorce that were based on this idea of fault, one of those grounds being cruelty.

         To get a divorce on the grounds of cruelty people had to prove that their spouse had been physically cruel towards them—prove it, not allege it—over a minimum continuous period of 12 months. In the 1960s it was thought that anything less than that was not grounds for their leaving a marriage. If people left the marriage because of the cruelty of their spouse on grounds anything less than that they lost all claim to custody of their children, all claim to any joint property—all claim to the things that were part of that marriage. That is an attitude that goes back only to the 1960s. That was the law until the Family Law Act 1975. What a very stark contrast in attitudes between that—a change of only 20 years ago—and what we are looking at now.

         When one delves into this subject of gender bias and legal administration, inevitably the issue one comes up against is violence, as I said a minute ago. I sought out some editorial comment and some newspaper coverage on this matter which I would like to refer to. In regard to physical access, rural women are at a particular disadvantage because they are physically isolated within, possibly, their own homes. If they are on a farm, for example, they are physically isolated further because they may have access to the services of only a rather small country town. They are further isolated by virtue of the fact that the sorts of support mechanisms that may exist for women in violent situations exist only in communities with much higher level of populations. The

This program aims to enhance the awareness of judges and decision makers about the nature and effects of violence against women and, as the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) stated, the need to consider the role played by stereotyped assumptions about women and violence, especially in the resolution of family law matters.

It is interesting to highlight the fact that a very high proportion of submissions to the Law Reform Commission from individuals, community organisations and service providers show just how vitally important this is to everyday women across Australia. It is a matter not only for the urban areas but also for many regional cities and country towns across Australia.

It is also a sobering thought to note that 65 per cent of submissions to the Law Reform Commission related to violence in some form or another.

         I would like to speak briefly on several issues raised in this excellent report. I recommend the report to those who might be listening and to the wider community. The first major issue is the difficulty facing women in getting access to justice; the second key issue is the failure of justice to respond to the needs of women at risk. The report mentions several obstacles facing women as they attempt to gain access to justice. As I have mentioned before, their lack of awareness of the law and legal services is an indictment of our way of life. Many women have had little or no opportunity to learn about the law, what it is, how it works and how it applies to them with regard to their marriage, their children and other relationships. Surely this should be part and parcel of our education system as not only females but also males progress through life.

         People often feel intimidated by the thought of dealing with a lawyer—women even more so, as most lawyers are male. Women often lack the confidence and experience to enable them to gain the proper advice and information. This surely places them in some jeopardy and risk. Another serious obstacle is the lack of awareness by police of women's needs and experiences. Even when women are aware of their rights, they are often unable to exercise them because of the prevailing attitudes of police. The honourable member for Moncrieff highlighted in her speech numerous examples of where this is the case. Police throughout Australia are generally ignorant of the place of domestic violence as a crime.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another obstacle is the failure by legal service providers to give accurate and appropriate assistance. Numerous concerns have been raised about solicitors, chamber magistrates and local court staff giving women incorrect information or inappropriate advice, especially about awareness for help in domestic violence and family law matters.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Yet another obstacle is the cost of legal advice. As women in our society are generally poorer and worse off than men, so the cost of legal assistance deters many women from pursuing legal remedies to the situations they face—be they custody or access for their children, domestic violence or property division when family break-up occurs. The last obstacle facing women is the inaccessibility of services—where they are sited, the hours of operation and the lack of child-care facilities to enable women to access the services available to them.

         The other key issue is the failure of the justice system to respond to the needs of women at risk. Numerous submissions throughout the report reflected women's almost total disillusionment with the legal system. It is interesting to note that these women remembered more bitterly their treatment in the legal system than the original mistreatment from their assailants. I think that is worthy of mention. Many women throughout Australia felt totally intimidated by the legal system and felt alienated by their experiences within this judicial system. Many felt that their credibility and the seriousness of their problems had been undermined or almost totally dismissed.

         There are many important recommendations listed in the report and I would like to mention just a few of them. There is a great need for additional funds to be targeted at women's needs. Specialist advocates should be employed in legal aid commissions to assist women. I am pleased to report that this is already happening in my state of Tasmania. A specialist will be dealing with all matters relating to the Family Court in my state. Another recommendation worthy of note is that community based service centres should be funded to employ women's advocates to enable women to better access the services available to them. Women isolated through various circumstances should have ready and free access to telephone and information services.

In this, the International Year of the Family, I think it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that the report is widely read and distributed. As members of the various electorates throughout Australia we can, in some small way, ensure that the recommendations are supported as fully as possible.

         —The powers—which are generally unfettered—of inquiries in matters such as this belong to the police. There was a full police investigation of this matter and the involvement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. As the House will be aware, the honourable member was cleared by the police of any wrongdoing. In terms of what one may term a coercive power, it seems that that power has already been exercised. The honourable member actually asked for the inquiry—that is, beyond the question of whether there was any illegality, which was a matter for the police, he asked for an inquiry which went to the question of his ministerial duties and his ministerial performance. That seems to me to be an inquiry of a completely different character than a royal commission, which is an inquiry of matters which may relate, in this circumstance, to illegality.

         Therefore, the inquiry will proceed as it can in the face of any police investigation or any charge which is being heard. It will be the judgment of the inquirer—upon advice, of course—as to how far the inquiry may proceed in the intermediate term while those matters are being heard. I do not believe that this type of inquiry, which is one that looks at the political role and the judgments expected of a minister, requires coercive powers of the royal commission variety. I think the standard being set here has applied, obviously in an ambient way, over the last couple of decades. Of course the inquirer is well aware of that.

         —The Commonwealth's offer to the states for the next three years is indeed a generous one. The Commonwealth is proposing that instead of continuing for the next three years with the current provision—which adjusts financial assistance grants by inflation, maintaining grants in real terms—we move to a system of real terms per capita. This means that we will adjust the financial assistance grants paid to the states not only by inflation but also by population growth, which means that the grants will grow by a further one per cent per annum.

         That is a very significant change indeed. It means that the states will have a system in place which gives them a better chance to fully provide for the increased level of services required on the basis of a growing population, and gives them greater capacity if they can make efficiencies to even increase the quality and level of those services as well.

         The Commonwealth, in making that significant change, has done so with an eye to achieving a more cooperative federalism than perhaps has been in place in the past. We have seen in recent times, with the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart a month ago, an example of the states being willing to cooperate with the Commonwealth in micro-economic reform. That is not fully in place yet but certainly substantial steps were taken there and we expect this cooperation to be cemented further in August at the next COAG meeting. In recognition of that we are prepared to take steps, even at some budgetary cost in the out-years, to put in place this more generous funding arrangement for financial assistance grants in the expectation that the states will continue to cooperate on micro-economic reform.

         The generosity of this new formula is shown by the fact that if inflation were to continue at its forecast level for 1994-95 and if population were to increase at one per cent, which one would assume to be the case, then over the next decade the states would get a cumulative additional $9 billion. That is a very substantial amount of additional funds indeed and represents for the states an enormous opportunity to obtain a much better deal for the future. At this stage, the real terms per capita guarantee is for the next three years but obviously, if that works well in terms of cooperation over the three-year period, we would be willing to extend that into a further guaranteed period.

         For the states it all looks pretty good except that for the first year we are abolishing the Loan Council capital grants, which means that some $330 million will be taken away. Those Loan Council capital grants have been frozen in nominal terms since 1991. The distribution of these has been without any rationality in terms of present day needs. On a per capita basis, New South Wales receives $13; Queensland, $5; the ACT, $110; and the Northern Territory, $258. There is simply no rationality about that at all. In fact, that distribution goes back to priorities set in place in the 1920s. This element of the program of assistance to the states clearly is one which should be abolished, and funds distributed to the states should be on the basis of some resemblance to current needs.

         That is our proposal. It will mean that the states will not get as much growth in the first year as they expected to get but it will mean that there will consequently be a saving to the Commonwealth in terms of the forward estimates for 1994-95. However, in the out-years there are great benefits to the states and they would be foolish indeed to knock back such a magnificent opportunity to greatly improve the resources available to them in the years ahead.

The Prime Minister would be aware, however, that there is a connection between the two inquiries; namely, surprisingly, that Mr Mike Codd has been asked to be commissioner assisting the chairman of the inquiry into ASIS whilst at the same time conducting the sandwich shop inquiry. I would have thought that on any objective test both inquiries would take up a considerable time. What priority does the Prime Minister place on each inquiry? Which one will take precedence?

There are some impediments to the latter inquiry to which the honourable member referred proceeding in full because of the matters being heard against one of the people involved—a point that I referred to earlier. Therefore, that may suit the kinds of requirements which Mr Codd might face. The other matter requires the kinds of powers which the inquirer has been given in contradistinction to the kinds of powers that Mr Codd would otherwise enjoy in the matter that I was questioned about in the first question.

         The friendship bridge will be a dramatic and beneficial change for the people of Laos and north-east Thailand as well as to South-East Asia as a whole. It provides the first ever road link between Thailand and Laos. It will greatly boost the economic prospects of Laos, which is a landlocked country—indeed, one of the poorest countries in Asia—by providing access for its products by road and, eventually, rail to the port of Bangkok. So it will make a great economic difference to this country. The bridge will be owned jointly by Thailand and Laos and a bilateral agreement between them will cover management, maintenance and jurisdictional issues.

         I think it is fair to say that this bridge is evidence of a new spirit of cooperation, fostered by Australia, between two neighbours. In this part of South-East Asia, with Australia's involvement in the settlement in Cambodia, our involvement, particularly in Indochina, has been especially important in underlining the interests which Australia has had in this area.

         The completion of the bridge will have wider regional applications too. It will help in the rapidly moving integration of the countries of former Indochina into the rest of South-East Asia as well as have important long-term security and economic consequences. The construction of the bridge means that for the first time in history—this is quite a claim for Australia to be able to make—people will be able to drive from Singapore to Beijing: a major new transportation corridor with enormous potential for the countries along that corridor.

         I pay tribute to Australia for the construction of the bridge—a great tribute to Australia and to those who were involved with it. The physical work for the bridge extends 2.1 kilometres. It is a concrete, single box girder design and it will carry two lanes of traffic with provision for a railway line to be built down the centre. The design and project management were carried out by an Australian joint venture between Maunsell and Partners Pty Ltd and Sinclair Knight and Partners and construction was undertaken by John Holland Construction. Much of the construction material was Australian. The bridge has been enormously important in providing experience and building a high reputation for Australian design and construction firms in the region.

         There is a very great interest now in Australia's civil engineering capacity, not simply in public works like this but also in private works. So it should have important spin-offs for Australia in a commercial way. It has also meant that a core of skilled Thai and Lao technicians have been trained to manage the bridge and to look after its future. The bridge was constructed in 26 months at a cost of $42 million—an outstanding achievement and within all of our estimates. It is difficult to imagine any more fitting or enduring symbol of Australia's commitment to our region than this one. This will completely change the economy of these countries. The fact that Australia is so obviously identified with it by funding it and building it is something which stands very great in the country's favour.

         —After all these things, as a consequence of which we have seen a change of personnel in the ministry and the cabinet. Some ministers elected not to contest the last election; ex-Senator Button was obvious among them. After the election, the former member for Bonython made it clear that he thought he should not take on further major ministerial responsibilities. And, latterly, of course, after just on 11 years of the most backbreaking effort, the former member for Fremantle announced his resignation to this House—after a phenomenal record of change that will stand him, in particular, and others in good stead through the balance of their lives, public or private. Now I think that we are seeing this kind of change. Any person who has served in the parliament for a long time and in high public office for a long time has the option to do these things.

         But the important thing about the government is that the government is changing its membership and strengthening the stock of members for the next 20 years. The government is going through a process of genuine renewal. If one looks at the people who have replaced the former members for Werriwa, Fremantle and Bonython, in the categories of postwar service to this parliament and in postwar ministries in this country, those people would stand up against any other in that company. I am very pleased about the fact that the Labor Party has not only had the wit, the imagination, the flair and the verve to change Australia, but as well, in the process of it, to make a change to a new group of ministers and members to keep the change going, to keep the reform going. As a consequence, the Labor Party is now a party of office, it is experienced—

         By contrast, who is coming on the coalition side? The person replacing the former member for Mackellar has nothing like the progressive social views or contact with the community that the former member had—or the former member for Warringah had. He at least was able sensibly to relate to the kind of society we now have. As I said the other day, they are being replaced by fogies—a fogy being a person who is attached to old values and old norms that are now irrelevant. It is true to say that we are seeing a combination of old fogies and young fogies but, nevertheless, 24-carat fogies.

         I referred earlier to the work of the foreign minister. One of the things that we should bear in mind is that the government has not only created structures within Australia, but it has created structures for Australia outside of Australia. It has done this with the development of APEC as the primary organisation outside of the GATT to look at issues of trade, trade development and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific area. It has now succeeded in having that body meet at a leadership level, at a heads of government level. It is meeting again in November this year in Indonesia. I should think that, in the annals of Australian foreign policy, that is a pretty reasonable achievement for this country.

Is it a fact that what it got as a partner was a loss making, undercapitalised, late reporting, inefficient, polluting, financial failure half-owned by the Prime Minister of this country? What it got was the Prime Minister and his half-owned Brown and Hatton group, which is broke. Furthermore, is it a fact that the Prime Minister has a partner who is under a huge cloud? Are these the reasons why the Prime Minister is now attempting to bail out of this insolvent mess, whereas a fortnight ago he was telling us what a wonderful investment it was?

        I can only add to that the absolute humbug and double standards of the Leader of the National Party in attacking this project when he has, in his own electorate, a piggery five times the size that this one will eventually be; that is, it is currently eight times the size of the current business—half the distance from the city of Corowa. It just shows the complete hypocrisy of the opposition.

Has the minister's attention been drawn to the concerns raised by many citizens regarding the construction of mobile telephone transmission towers? Can the minister inform the House whether the mobile telephone companies—Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone—have to carry out environmental impact statements or community consultations before construction on the site begins? Are there guidelines or a code of practice in place that must be followed before these towers can be erected? If not, when would such guidelines be established and implemented?

         All three carriers—Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone—have been granted exemption from certain state and territory laws for specified activities, and those activities include the construction of towers for providing new antennae for mobile telecommunications. The parliament provided these exemptions because we believe it is important that we roll out that mobile telephone network as soon as possible to provide a competitive mobile telecommunications market for Australians.

         When carrying out these exempt activities all three carriers are bound by the provisions of the draft telecommunications national code, which was determined in December 1991. Under that code the carriers are required to notify local councils of their proposals, with full details, and to provide the local councils with an opportunity to comment. The code also requires the carriers to assess the environmental significance of their activities and, in addition, they must inform CEPA—the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency—if any of the proposals are considered to be environmentally significant.

If necessary, carriers can be required to comply with any recommendations which CEPA may believe are necessary. In connection with the proposed tower at Mount Eliza, I understand that that is now before CEPA for its consideration. I can inform the honourable member that the revised final code is expected to be tabled in the House in the budget sittings.

         —I start by pointing out to the honourable member for Greenway that newsagent distribution arrangements are already covered by the Trade Practices Act and, as he would know, the act allows for authorisation for anti-competitive conduct where there is an overriding public benefit. In the early 1980s the Trade Practices Commission authorised a territorial monopoly for newsagents—that is, a discrete area where newsagents had the monopoly to distribute papers, books and magazines. It did so because the newsagents argued on public benefit that they could guarantee the delivery of newspapers. The Hilmer recommendations retain that authorisation process where a public benefit can be shown.

         In Victoria all parties to the Victorian distribution system have sought a new authorisation which will free up the system, and that has been granted. But appeals against this new authorisation have been lodged with the Trade Practices Tribunal. On the one hand, we have convenience stores arguing that the new authorisation does not go far enough and, on the other hand, we have Queensland newsagents saying that there should be no change, because they believe that any reform in Victoria will travel up to Queensland eventually.

         I point out to the House that this is now a matter for the tribunal, but there is nothing in the Hilmer report that will affect newsagents because they are already covered by the Trade Practices Act. I can say that their businesses and their assets are not threatened by the Hilmer reforms. Instead, it is in the areas that are not currently covered by the Trade Practices Act where there is the potential for cheaper prices and improved services which will flow from those reforms. I believe that will be good news for consumers, good news for industry and, ultimately, good news for Australia.

         Last September I launched a government campaign under the banner, `Australia: your business location in Asia'. That campaign has excited a great deal of interest, both in the Australian business community and with multinationals. Perhaps the best way to put the issue into perspective is to let the record to date speak for itself. Already 60 multinational corporations have established their headquarters in Australia and are servicing markets throughout Asia. They are all very significant companies and their decision clearly demonstrates that someone seriously holds the view that Australia offers a central path to Asia.

         In recent months, another 14 multinationals have indicated their decision to relocate their headquarters here, confirming that the campaign is paying dividends. The government has targeted over 600 companies in North America and Europe and opened up negotiations with them about regional headquarters. Only 57 have indicated that they were not interested and contact continues with the rest. About 100 have expressed a very high level of interest in coming to Australia, and naturally we are concentrating our efforts on them.

         I have been particularly heartened by the support the government has been offered by Australia's business leaders in this campaign. For example, late last year a regional headquarters leaders' network was established with 20 of Australia's chief executives, including leading figures from the opposition of the past, those executives forming an alliance to promote Australia as a regional headquarters destination. These busy executives are not about wasting their time and they obviously agree that Australia is a competitive alternative to investment destinations such as Hong Kong or Singapore.

         —I do not want to prolong my answer; I like short answers. When the Treasurer—at the time it was John Dawkins—announced special tax measures to assist some corporations, such as sales tax concessions on second-hand computers, two members of the opposition put out press releases condemning them, saying that it was unfair to other Australian businesses and that they would not be associated with any plan to assist regional headquarters to come into Australia by taxation means. Honourable members opposite ask me to tell them; I am telling them. The opposition is on the public record as opposing these measures, although I understand that Charles Blunt has now managed to twist the tail of the National Party. The National Party has decided to bring the opposition into line and sort it out, and I am very pleased about that indeed.

         —by leave—Honourable members will recall allegations made in January this year that Telecom had monitored and recorded telephone conversations of certain customers without their consent. These relate primarily to customers known as COT—casualties of Telecom—cases. Honourable members will also recall that, when I first became aware of these very serious allegations in January, I immediately made clear the gravity with which the government views any such breach of customer privacy.

         I immediately wrote to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) asking that he investigate whether a breach of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act had occurred, and he in turn referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police. Since that time, in answer to many inquiries from members and senators from all parties, I have undertaken to provide information to the parliament once the police investigation was completed. The purpose of my brief statement today is to honour my commitment to report progress in this matter before the House breaks for its recess, even though police inquiries are continuing.

         On the more general area of customer service, Telecom has already responded to the report of the independent consultant, Coopers and Lybrand, on fault reporting and complaints handling received in November last year. Steps taken include new procedures for fault diagnosis and rectification; improved customer complaint procedures; a system of management review of complaints and fault actions, oversighted by a national customer response unit; and wider dissemination of information to customers on how to contact Telecom about complaints and faults. These new procedures will be implemented progressively over the rest of 1994 and are expected to be in place by 31 December.

         On the specific issue of customer privacy, at my request Telecom has undertaken a thorough examination of what action needs to be taken to prevent any future breaches of customer privacy when voice monitoring of customer calls is undertaken. I am pleased to report that Telecom has prepared a revised privacy protection policy and revised guidelines for voice monitoring of customer calls. These documents are currently being reviewed by the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman prior to their finalisation and implementation.

         Before outlining what is proposed under these new policy guidelines, it is important to acknowledge the necessity for telecommunications carriers to be able to monitor customer lines to conduct their business properly, to provide quality service to customers. It is also important to note that in the vast majority of cases inquiries into service quality and difficulties either do not involve monitoring of customer voices at all or involve only `incidental' listening across customer lines which takes place for no more than a few seconds.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To put it into perspective, Telecom conducts more than four million tests a year in response to customer requests which involve incidental listening. These tests simply involve cutting across the telephone line to check whether a line is engaged before testing to determine the location and nature of the fault: for example, whether a line is crossed or the reason for no dial tone or noisy lines. In some of these cases, the customer call analysis system might also be subsequently used to monitor technical features of the call, but not voices. While these testing procedures are, of course, also subject to statutory control and strict privacy guidelines, they are not those to which the current allegations relate and they are not those I am addressing today.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The new guidelines will not apply to voice monitoring for law enforcement purposes, which require warrants authorised by a Federal Court judge, or to the maritime service and calls to the emergency services, all of which are dealt with separately. The cases which led to the allegations currently under investigation involve instances where voice monitoring and/or recording of customer conversations has been used to investigate difficult faults and it is to such cases that the revised privacy rules will apply.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The proposed guidelines acknowledge that, in dealing with service complaints which are difficult to locate, it may be necessary to consider voice monitoring of a customer's line but that before such monitoring takes place the customer's written consent must be obtained. Such consent must be specific to the nature of the activity and the time frame involved. Written approval must first be obtained from a senior authorised Telecom employee who must inform the exchange supervisor in writing that monitoring has been approved and for what time frame and procedure. All equipment used in voice monitoring will carry pip tones at three-second intervals to indicate to both parties to a call that monitoring is taking place. This latter point is particularly important for the privacy protection of the second party to monitored calls; that is, the people whose conversations are monitored while they are talking on the telephone to customers who have given their consent to the monitoring.

         There are further more stringent requirements proposed where voice recording, as well as monitoring, is used in the diagnosis and substantiation of faults.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The proposed guidelines require that recording will not be permitted except in the following circumstances. If a customer specifically requests Telecom in writing to undertake voice recording to assist in finding faults, the matter must be raised with Telecom's legal department for consideration and approval. Voice recording may only be approved by written sign-off by the chief executive officer, the group managing director of the commercial and consumer division or the group managing director of network and technology, after receiving written advice from Telecom's legal department.

         Security arrangements covering both physical and privacy aspects will be applied in each case. The period of the recording and the identity of all officers proposed to have access to the recording will need to be documented as part of the approval process. Analysis of the recording will be confined to the approved technical analysis and no copies or transcripts of recorded information are permitted. Finally, all recordings will be required to carry three-second pip tones and will be erased immediately on completion of the testing process.

         I believe it is important that, once finalised, such stringent rules are adopted by all telecommunications carriers in Australia. I shall be pursuing this during the parliamentary recess. Telecom's revised privacy protection policy provides for a regular, independent compliance audit and I will also be urging carriers to adopt a similar requirement.

         I will also be examining options for further tightening customer privacy safeguards, possibly by including appropriate requirements in telecommunications carrier licences, through legislation or through the introduction of an industry code of practice supervised by an independent authority such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.

         In summary, these safeguards will require the written consent of a customer before any voice monitoring or recording takes place and a three-second pip to protect the privacy of the second party to the call. I undertake to report back to honourable members and telephone consumers on all of these areas once the outstanding matters have been resolved and the relevant bodies have been consulted.

         —by leave—The statement by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is welcome, although I must admit that on reading through it there seems to be one glaring omission, which I point out to the minister and to Telecom. In my view there should be a record kept of all occasions on which there has been, for one reason or another, a telephone conversation recorded. Obviously there cannot necessarily be the same register around the states, but I would think it would not be difficult, in a central exchange in each state or territory, for there to be a list made of those authorised occasions when persons have had their telephone conversations recorded. On that could be put the number of the telephone, the duration of the recording and the date and the time so that it is possible for there to be reference back.

         I do not think there are many people who from time to time have not wondered from the nature of their telephone reception whether or not there was somebody else at the end of the line. Quite often I have said, `Hello Paul'—and people would understand why. There are many instances when the security and privacy of conversations on the telephone are important such that people do like to feel that they are not in any way having their private conversations intruded upon.

         I note that in the new procedures there is a suggestion that there should be approval given for voice monitoring of a customer's line when service complaints require a linesman to intervene. I wish the minister well in that, although I should tell him that the very nature of the way in which the present analog copper wire system works is that a linesman will be able—quite simply, by climbing a pole and trying to check faults in the normal course of duty—unexpectedly and not necessarily intentionally to tap into a line. The practice has been that if a linesman is out somewhere he uses that line in order to phone in and report where he is and whether there are crossed wires. That is all in the normal course of maintenance. While I accept that the guidelines the minister has indicated have an advantage, I suggest to him that in the practical day-to-day operations of linesmen there inevitably will be some intrusion. I know it is unintentional. I think people have to accept it. The fact that there are guidelines, as the minister has promulgated in this place, should provide protection.

         The third thing that worries me is whether in the nature of the changed processes—and, not being an engineer like the minister, I cannot say that I am exactly sure—with fibre optics and the satellite, the same technical procedures will necessarily be possible. For example, my understanding is that fibre optics carry a large number of messages along a wire. I am not too sure how they are separated if the wire is picked up at any point and intruded upon. Again, this unintentional intrusion on a private conversation is something that I suspect it will facilitate. Certainly that is true with the satellite. It is a problem that many of us encounter in our day-to-day telephone conversations. It is very rare—certainly in the bush, where I live—to pick up a line and not pick up on somebody's telephone conversation. I was quite intrigued the other night when ringing a number in Victoria to pick up a number in Tenterfield, in my own electorate. For various reasons there are crossed lines.

At the moment, while Austel is the principal competitor, there are a number of other operators, operating on select frequencies in select areas, which will have virtually their own telephone service. Demonstrably, the interventions that this statement refers to are by Telecom. I think it needs to be understood that, as we get more operators, it is possible that there will need to be a recognition by those who operate those other lines that the same restraints will apply to them. I have no doubt that the minister intends that that should be so.

         The other area is that, as the minister has mentioned, there are legitimate phone-tapping processes and procedures undertaken by warrant. I am interested that the new guidelines apparently require warrants authorised by a Federal Court judge for calls to the maritime service and the emergency services. They are all dealt with separately. At one stage there were warrants issued by supreme courts exercising federal jurisdiction. I presume that this is still so. I think it is important that it is understood that there is a range of people—for example, customs and migration—who have a capacity for law enforcement purposes, with the authority of a court order, to monitor telephone conversations. It needs to be understood that those conditions will apply.

         Having been a minister in this field, I am not too sure that I have ever been completely happy that these were completely accurately recorded. I know that there is a great deal of interfactional jealousy between law enforcing agencies in Australia, but I believe it is important that there again be a central register of those cases where there is an official warrant to intercept telephone calls. Obviously, because of their very nature, it is important that they be kept in a secure way. I would think it might be appropriate that that responsibility be given to a registrar of the Federal Court, because that court would have a register of any warrants that are issued. It may well be that it should be a person within the domain of one of the law officers of this place—be it the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice—who keeps that register. It is important, not just at the time when the intervention takes place but subsequently, that there is an exact record, and one that can be believed, of where and when it happened.

         Having been fairly actively involved as a minister in the field, I am worried that there have been occasions when I have not known that the recording of those official interceptions was as good as it might be. I think it needs to be looked at. While the opposition supports the statement by the minister, I hope the minister might take on board and pursue those other dimensions. I thank him for nodding his head in affirmation.

         —by leave—The government and the overwhelming majority of Australians were greatly disturbed by the violent attack upon the premises of the Iranian Embassy in Canberra on 6 April 1992 in which the chancellery was vandalised and members of the staff were assaulted. The attack was one of a number of incidents carried out against Iranian missions in several countries. Such incidents undermine one of the basic premises of civilised international relations—that diplomatic missions will be protected from intrusion and violence.

         It is most regrettable that an incident like this could occur in Australia. The Australian government has apologised to the government of Iran for the attack upon its embassy and has paid compensation for the injuries and damage which occurred. Law enforcement agencies acted very quickly after the incident to make arrests. As honourable members will be aware, a number of persons were recently convicted over the incident.

         Following the incident, however, the government was concerned that the responsible Australian authorities had failed to come to grips with prior indications that an attack upon the Iranian Embassy was possible. The Canberra incident occurred several hours after attacks overseas and after the Iranian Embassy notified Australian officials that the embassy staff had received threatening phone calls.

         Ministers acted immediately to direct departments and agencies to take steps to improve their internal procedures. In addition, the government commissioned Mr Michael Codd, a former secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to carry out a full and searching examination of plans and arrangements to counter terrorism, including the security of foreign diplomatic and consular missions.

         Mr Codd found that Australia has invested considerable effort and resources into arrangements for countering politically motivated violence and that a commendable degree of cooperation has been achieved between Commonwealth and state agencies. But Mr Codd also concluded there were serious weaknesses in Commonwealth arrangements for the period prior to the commencement of the incident—that is to say in the area of prevention. Mr Codd made a number of wide-ranging recommendations to correct these weaknesses.

         The critical elements of Mr Codd's recommendations have been implemented. Arrangements for passing critical information between agencies have been overhauled and responsibilities for determining the need to provide extra guarding for missions under special threat have been changed. Much has been done to improve our capacity to monitor events overseas and local community reactions to them. The national anti-terrorist plan has been reworked to reflect these changes and better address the prevention of incidents. The ability of agencies to deal with problems occurring outside normal business hours is now regularly tested.

         The Codd review also suggests that the Commonwealth conduct a coordinated review of the distribution of total resources applied to counter-terrorism, politically motivated violence and diplomatic and consular protection functions.

         No country is asked, or is able, to guarantee that no act of violence will ever occur against diplomatic or consular missions. But the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the state and territory governments, must provide a safe environment in which foreign missions can function. There is no hiding from the fact that Australian authorities did not do all they could have done to prevent the attack upon the Iranian embassy in April 1992. The government believes that the Codd review provides an open and full assessment of the reasons for this failure and that, with the implementation of Mr Codd's recommendations, arrangements for the protection of foreign missions have been significantly improved.

It is my view that yesterday Senator Richardson had a look at that watch and decided that time was up. The Keating cabinet is voting with its feet. It is a government that is in terminal decline. A succession of ministers have now voted with their feet. The government is racked with unprecedented instability. If we look back over the last nearly 2 1/2 years, at the some 15 people who have resigned or left or been forced to go, we have seen a whole succession of ministers go for a host of reasons. Some of them were forced to resign in disgrace. Some were told to take a walk because they were operating under some cloud or were awaiting the outcome of some inquiry. Others were simply frustrated, bitter and fed up, and gave it away.

Today he was talking about a government with the imagination, the flair, the verve and the wit to change Australia. It is supposed to be a sort of normal flow going on here. We are supposed to be witnessing generational change. In fact, he calls it `invigorating generational change'. But of those who have gone, three of the recent departures are younger than the Prime Minister himself. That is not generational change—it is degenerational change. There is no natural change going on here. There is nothing short of a purge taking place. It is not orchestrated. It is about as controlled or planned as a runaway train.

As we saw today, that is not the end it; we have at least two more on the way. Senator Evans is clearly on the way, either to the United Nations or to the High Court. The Prime Minister would not rule out the possibility that Senator Evans was off to the High Court. And poor old Brian Howe sits there knowing that he is about to be removed. The government has been running the rumours around the gallery that Brian Howe is on his way out and Carmen Lawrence is on her way in to the deputy leadership of the ALP to try to offset, to give some sort of sensitivity to, this megalomaniac we have today as Prime Minister.

If you want to be a courtier in his court, in the emperor's court, you have to fawn; you have to walk around saying `Yes, sir; no, sir; three bags full, sir'. There is no way you can criticise because then you will be on your way out. Look at Senator Richardson—a classic example of one who dared to take on the Prime Minister and stand him to his ground and tell him what was wrong with the way he was running this government.

Two of the key ones who put the Prime Minister where he now is and who supported him through the last 2 1/2 years—John Dawkins and Graham Richardson—have left by choice because they were fed up and bitter. They left because they know that this government is in terminal decline and that it is going to go nowhere with a Prime Minister that is so visibly out of touch with the hopes and aspirations of the average Australian.

         The issues, in so far as there are any in this debate, were amply dispatched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when the Leader of the Opposition was silly enough to get in his way at question time. The Prime Minister was able to point out that our almost 11 years in office is now four years longer than the time experienced by ex-Fraser ministers. It a very long period in this country in a political atmosphere which is far busier than it certainly has been at any time since Federation and which will continue to get busier over the years. Political careers get shorter and ministers now need renewal far more often than in the past. As a result, changes are likely to take place.

         Of the list of ministers who have left the government since the time it was first put in place, which the Leader of the Opposition read out, virtually all of those ministers left cheerfully and voluntarily after many years of service. After all the things we have heard the opposition say about Graham Richardson and John Dawkins over the years and about their role in the management of the Australian economy and their role in Australian politics, was it not wonderful to hear the Leader of the Opposition stand up here and say, `They are the heart and soul of a once great Labor Party and obviously left office because suddenly, in the space of six months, from being the greatest political party ever, the Labor Party has declined to mere dross'. That is the proposition that the opposition leader puts forward in his desultory argument in his absurd matter of public importance.

         The other reason why he has to let people know that he is still around other than the fact that nobody on his side actually wants him around is that he has not really had a terrific set of weeks on the by-election front with either the seats the Liberals are likely to hold or the seats that they failed to win. What has been the performance? A 2 1/2 per cent swing to the government in Fremantle and then moderate level swings in Bonython and in John Kerin's former seat. Let us compare and contrast those results with the results that the opposition was getting during the 1980s—13 per cent, I seem to recollect in one South Australian seat, 11 per cent to win in another case and something like 10 per cent, I recollect, during the leadership of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). So he has managed to come under by between three and effectively 16 1/2 per cent the performances in those by-elections in his particular operation.

         It also has to be remembered that, after the quite massive by-election swings in the 1980s, the Labor government was subsequently returned. None of them actually turned out to be Bass by-elections; they all turned out to be just storms in a teacup. The particular by-elections that we have had running lately—the bulk of the opposition's frontbenchers are running out of this chamber, before I have been able to explain it to them—provided the opposition in normal circumstances with enormous chances to demonstrate its effectiveness, to take the high ground. Any darned opposition can do that in a by-election, except one wallowing in unbelievable disunity and incompetence. What such an opposition turns in is the performance that the opposition leader has turned in in the last three by-elections that I have just mentioned.

That is unusual. Normally in the course of a by-election campaign we would expect a grand remonstrance against the government of the day from the opposition person in the box seat. But no, we do not get grand remonstrances against the government of the day in this case. What we get from that chap carrying the Liberal Party banner is a suggestion as to how the Liberal Party might determine its leadership over the next few months by a public opinion poll.

Five by-elections in a three-month block is an unusual test for government activity at any particular point. These by-elections have provided or will provide three great results for the Labor Party, including one outstanding result, and two opportunities for people who would be traitors—they are standing up to the leadership, anyway—to present themselves. What will they get when they get here? A couple—in attitudinal terms, as the Prime Minister said—of fogeys, old and young.

         This matter of public importance comes about through the resignation of one Graham Richardson, who I can at this hour refer to as Graham Richardson. He is responsible for the creation of the cruel parody of a leader in Prime Minister Keating—a monster beyond the control of his party, the parliament or the people. That is the real tragedy of today. That is the real tragedy of Richardson's resignation. That is the real tragedy of this arrogant government, which, as the Leader of the Opposition correctly says, is now in terminal decline.

Richardson is the man who said of the Prime Minister:

        Again, how prophetic did that turn out to be. Here was a minister trying to take on the Prime Minister, trying to make him see some sort of sense in the health debate, trying to make some commonsense of a health policy which sees 422 country towns without a doctor as I speak this day. We have a Prime Minister who simply is out of touch—in an isolated capsule, in a cocoon, a long way removed from the average person of Bankstown or even of Banks and the communities in those areas.

         The matter under discussion is the resignation of one Senator Graham Richardson—the fourth minister in four months, the 15th minister since the honourable member for Blaxland became Prime Minister.

         The problem with all of this is that, rather than having a fulsome debate in the cabinet room, rather than having a government coming to grips with divergent views, we are going to have a mealy-mouthed mob of sycophants. Who now will sit around the cabinet table and dare to look at the Prime Minister eye to eye and say, `No, Prime Minister', from time to time when that has to be done. The native bird prints on the cabinet room walls should be removed and replaced by pictures of pigeons, because tame pigeons are what the Prime Minister wants in his cabinet room—all sitting there cooing together; all cooing their reassuring `Yes, Prime Minister; three bags full, Prime Minister. You are so wise, Prime Minister; you are so noble, Prime Minister'. It all means lousy government for the people of Australia—lousy government for those missing out on the economic recovery and for the families of Australia in this International Year of the Family.

         Before all the stories are written about a possible reshuffle, one other issue should be borne in mind which will reflect very badly on the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the ex-Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and the honourable member for Fremantle. I refer to a sham deal involving $8 million of taxpayers' money and political corruption at the highest levels. My colleague Senator Grant Tambling has done a lot of work on this issue, which revolves around the approval in August 1992 from One Nation road funding of $8 million for the Subiaco Oval—a project in the electorate of the then Western Australian state Premier, now the honourable member for Fremantle.

         Some questions need to be answered about this matter. Firstly, did the former federal Treasurer reveal his personal links with the Western Australian football fraternity when he took part in the backroom deals involved in the $8 million deal? Secondly, will the government order an inquiry into Mr Dawkins's conduct if, as is widely rumoured, he is appointed to either the Western Australian football commission or the Fremantle AFL club?

         As to the instability of this government, there have been four resignations in four months. The government has much to answer for. The people of Australia are missing out on the desirable stability of government, the leadership of government and the absolute requirement of stability in key portfolios such as trade where we have had several ministers in a short period and the loss of contacts. We have had a trade minister who never went to the Middle East at any stage during that period. That is why I support the matter of public importance.

A couple of minutes ago I witnessed the Leader of the Opposition walk in and read a document. I then saw it read out verbatim by the Leader of the National Party in this MPI debate in which what he has said has been of little relevance. Those opposite are in opposition because they are of little relevance to the electorate and to the people of Australia, and they have been for the last decade.

         Today is a significant day because it marks the fourth anniversary of my election to the parliament—24 March 1990. It is also significant in that, when the results of the two by-elections on the weekend are counted, in just over four years 59 new members will have been elected to the House of Representatives—almost a 40 per cent turnover in the House in such a short time. Politics has changed. The first member for Banks, the late Eric Costa, who served from 1949 till 1969—20 years—did not sit on the government benches. He served his whole period in opposition. The second member for Banks, Vince Martin, served for 10 years and served for only three out of his 10 years in the Whitlam government. I have known only government since I have been the member for Banks.

         The way the opposition is going, I will know only government in the next decade. Opposition members are giving  it to us on a plate. One of the things that we have managed to do successfully as a party in government, which has not been easy, is to regenerate and produce quality members of parliament—witnessed by the results of the last couple of by-elections. The election of Dr Lawrence in Fremantle was a superb result. The by-elections in Bonython and Werriwa were exceptional results as far as by-elections go. The members are all ministerial material—all quality candidates. That is what frightens the opposition. That is why it is so desperate to replace the current Leader of the Opposition, who is on borrowed time. The only reason he survived so long is his shadow ministry. There are 37 shadow ministers and it is an interchange bench.

        I have something to assist Mr Abbott's survey. He should add a square that states `none of the above', because it would win by a country mile. The reality is that the Liberal Party does not have its future leader in this place at this time. That is why the dogs are barking. Some people might hope that, if Bronwyn Bishop wins the by-election, she will be Carlton's revenge. That will be his legacy to the Liberal Party and his leader who dumped him. He resigned to enable former Senator Bishop to transfer to the lower house to complete the destabilisation campaign. It is all show and, frankly, no punch.

         For the opposition to bring on an MPI on this day, the fourth anniversary of the government's 1990 election victory, is such an act of hypocrisy, when the reality is, in the view of most objective observers, that it was the opposition's ineptitude which resulted in the Labor Party winning what many people thought was an `unwinnable' election—and win it, we did. I must confess I was not one of the true believers. I thought we would have a hard job—and we did.

My good friend Gerry Hand, the former minister for immigration, who is listening at this very moment, chose his own retirement, as all champions do. Where is he now?

It is now suggested that amendment No. 7 be agreed to; previous advice was that it was not to be accepted.

         —There are two matters. I understood that the government was accepting the Senate's amendment in relation to that matter on the basis that it had an opinion that suggested that the amendment was no longer necessary because the government was going to achieve its objectives in other ways. If that is the case, I cannot understand why the government is not prepared to accept the amendment and why it is continuing to press the matter. If I am wrong in relation to that, that is fine. The opposition will press the position we have taken on this matter. If it does not have the result that we anticipate, so be it, but I cannot understand why, if the government is confident in the advice that it has received—that it will achieve its objective by simply arguing that its original purpose was met in the way in which this clause was first drafted before the amendment that we have rejected—it is not prepared to accept that outcome. Why does it press the amendment? Why does it believe the amendment is essential if it believes that the amendment can be achieved in another way?
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          If that is the issue, as to the view that was formed in the administrative tribunals that borrowings against a property exclude, for instance, a home and the curtilage in relation to that, the opposition is firmly of the opinion that, if the borrowings were undertaken for the purpose of carrying on a business of primary industry, the whole of those borrowings ought to be subtracted from the value of the principal asset—the income producing asset, the farm—less the house and the curtilage. The government wants to apportion the debt. It argues that if a debt is incurred for running a business we ought to apportion it so that part of it is apportioned to the value of the home. The government seeks by that subterfuge to raise the total value of the assets of the farmer that might be taken into account for the purpose of the assets test.

         Our view in relation to assets testing of rural properties is that the provisions that are there at the moment are unnecessarily harsh and oppressive. That is why we argued before the last election that there should be a change in relation to that assets test. For that reason we are not prepared to accede to the government's request that that assets test be made more difficult for farmers to satisfy. I suspect that the reason the government presses this matter is that it is not happy with the advice that it has told me it thinks allows its objective to be achieved. That puts the matter beyond doubt if that is the question that we are debating. But my understanding was—and this is what I came in here prepared to debate—that the government did not accept another proposition that the opposition had sought.

         I seek the parliamentary secretary's clarification in relation to this matter because it may contain the debate. My understanding was that the government was not prepared to accept our suggestion that, in relation to the issue of the application of the new penalty interest regime, certain guidelines that will have to be drafted at some stage in the future to be used for testing people's obligations to pay a penalty interest ought to be disallowable instruments, so that the parliament might be able to assess the appropriateness of those guidelines for applying this new penalty interest regime.

I welcome the government's concurrence if it has accepted that amendment; that is, that the guidelines will still be a requirement and that they will be a disallowable instrument.

        I will deal with Senate amendment No. 3 first. The government agrees with the principles that the department should use the garnishee power where it can rather than apply penalty interest and that penalty interest should not apply where effective recovery action is in progress under a garnishee notice.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, the amendments as drafted do not appear to achieve these objectives. In particular, the government believes that Senate amendment No. 3 is superfluous and that, further, it implies a condition on the use of the garnishee power which does not exist in the act. Section 1233—the garnishee power—contains no requirement to issue another type of notice; namely, a penalty charge notice, prior to a garnishee. If the department has already issued a garnishee notice, the amendment would not stop the department then applying penalty interest as well. The latter argument also applies to paragraph (a) of Senate amendment No. 4. Since the government believes that Senate amendment No. 3 is superfluous, it opposes the amendment.

         Senate amendment No. 8 omits part 7 of the bill, which relates to the value of assets used in primary production. The amendments contained in part 7 were intended to clarify the original intention and existing policy that, where primary production liabilities are related to primary production assets whose values are partly exempt under section 1118 of the principal act, only that part of the liabilities relating to the non-exempt assets will be allowed as a deduction under the assets test. The objective of part 7 was merely to clarify the position as a result of the recent decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the matter of Little. Legal advice received from the Attorney-General's Department confirms that the existing legislation authorises the department's existing treatment of primary production assets. As a result, there is strictly no need to proceed with part 7. However, the government considers that the amendments should be proceeded with so as to clarify the position. That position is strongly recommended by the Attorney-General's Department.

         —I think I now understand precisely what we are doing. I would have preferred in relation to this particular matter—again, if there had been some consultation I might have suggested it—that the two amendments be dealt with separately because the approach which the opposition would take is to accept one and oppose the other. It may be, from the point of view of good order, that the government could resubmit the matter and we could vote on the amendments separately, in which case I foreshadow that the opposition accepts amendment No. 3. I will indicate why we are taking that view. I have already spoken to amendment No. 8 but I will briefly recapitulate my arguments on that matter.

         —The opposition accepts the approach that the government has taken. I indicate that the government proposes to disagree later in this debate with Senate amendment No. 2 and to substitute a new clause 8. In relation to that matter, there is a further effort to clarify the garnishee notice period and to deal with, in a slightly different way, the issues that the Senate has seen fit to amend.

         We have closely examined the government's proposals and we have taken some advice from interested organisations. I understand that the Australian Democrats, who have an interest in the matter, have done the same. We will accept amendment No. 2 and, on that basis, we see amendment No. 3 as being no longer necessary. It is part of the overall scheme that will be adopted in clause 8, which we find satisfactory, and therefore we will not oppose in this House the government's view that Senate amendment No. 3 be disagreed to.

         We believe the government's efforts to proportion indebtedness to assets which are income producing and non-income producing in relation to loans that are undertaken for an income producing purpose unreasonably increase the value of the assets of a primary producer. For that reason, we believe the following principle should be supported by the parliament: any indebtedness incurred for an income earning purpose ought to be apportioned totally against the income producing asset and not the home of a farmer, which is otherwise excluded. In relation to all assets testing, the home of a person who receives a benefit is excluded. In our view, it is unreasonable to boost the value of the assets by means of this technique.

         The government believes that it did that successfully with amendments that have been previously proposed. But, when the matter went before a tribunal, the government found out that the tribunal did not accept that view. The reason we have this amendment is that the government wants to put the matter beyond doubt. That is the issue. The reason we have this amendment is that, notwithstanding the advice that the government has received, it wants to put the matter beyond doubt. It does not want to rely on advice it has been given.

         We have no intention of accommodating the government in that matter. We are of the view that, if people are entitled, on the basis of the tribunal decision, to have their assets considered on the basis of the full debt being apportioned against the income producing asset owned by the farmer, that is the position that ought to be sustained. We may not be successful, even if we insist upon this amendment. But I regard the issue as one of substance. On that basis, the opposition will not accede to the government's request that this amendment be disagreed to and we will oppose the government's amendment.

         In particular, the Government believes that Senate amendment No. 3 is superfluous and that, further, it implies a condition on the sue of the garnishee power which does not exit in the Act. Section 1233 (the garnishee power) contains no requirement to issue another type of notice (ie a penalty charge notice) prior to a garnishee. If the Department has already issued a garnishee notice, the amendment would not stop the Department then applying penalty interest as well.

         Senate amendment No. 8 omits Part 7 of the Bill that relates to the value of assets used in primary production. The amendments contained in Part 7 were intended to clarify the original intention, and existing policy, that where primary production liabilities are related to primary production assets whose values are partly exempt under section 1118 of the Principal Act, only that part of the liabilities relating to the non-exempt assets will be allowed as a deduction under the assets test.

         The objective of Part 7 was merely to clarify the position as a result of the recent decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in Little. Indeed, legal advice received from the Attorney-General's Department confirms that the existing legislation authorises the Department's existing treatment of primary production assets. As a result, there is strictly no need to proceed with Part 7. However, the Government considers that the amendments should be proceeded with so as to clarify the position—a position strongly recommended by the Attorney-General's Department.

          —by leave—This inquiry into the efficiency dividend arrangements was conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration at the request of the then Minister for Finance, the Treasurer (Mr Willis). The committee received the reference at the end of August 1993 and the inquiry was advertised at the end of September 1993. A number of factors have made this a difficult task to finalise, not the least of which was the changed budget arrangements. As the recommendations in this report need to be considered in the context of the preparation of this year's budget, it was necessary that the committee report today.

          The efficiency dividend is a 1.25 per cent annual cut in the running cost appropriations of budget funded departments and agencies. The efficiency dividend is fairly unpopular in the public sector, particularly with small agencies. The purpose of the efficiency dividend is to ensure that the government receives a portion of the efficiency gains being generated in the public sector as a result of the management reforms of the last decade—in particular the running cost arrangements.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The dividend also focuses the minds of managers on the need to continue to strive for efficiencies, particularly in times of fiscal restraint. While many agencies are unhappy with the efficiency dividend, they are happy with the flexibility offered to them by the running cost arrangements, particularly the guaranteed funding over the forward estimates years. The committee was of the view that we do not get one without the other.

          Perhaps the most significant issue dealt with by the committee was the lack of data on productivity in the public sector—not just labour productivity but total factor productivity. If the efficiency dividend is to rely on anything more than anecdotal evidence of efficiency gains then greater emphasis needs to be placed on the better specification of qualitative and quantitative performance information. Without this data it is difficult to address concerns over the possible decline in service quality. It is also difficult to develop more sophisticated approaches than that provided by the efficiency dividend. The committee has recommended that the Department of Finance and the Department of Industrial Relations review the methods of assessing productivity in the public sector with a view to developing an approach which takes account of service quality as well as labour productivity.

          I will briefly touch on two areas that were raised with the committee. Workplace bargaining was cited by a number of agencies as an alternative to the efficiency dividend. The concern that the committee had was that current arrangements do not provide for a return to the budget. Furthermore, the progress to date has been insufficient to enable any conclusions to be drawn. The committee was of the view that the new arrangements for workplace bargaining should be negotiated from the view of ensuring that they provide for a return to the budget and so become a realistic alternative to the efficiency dividend.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another issue which was of concern to the committee was the situation of small agencies. It is obvious that some small agencies do have particular difficulties with the efficiency dividend; however, there is no evidence that any are in dire peril. The committee was concerned that some assistance be provided to small agencies. The recommendation to exempt section 35 receipts from the dividend should assist agencies that rely on external receipts. The logic of this recommendation is that the budget benefits directly from agencies seeking external funding or through the application of user pays principles. An exemption will encourage agencies to seek alternative avenues for funding and thus decrease their reliance on the budget. It also addresses the fact that there is no consistency in the application of the efficiency dividend to section 35 receipts, with numerous agencies being granted exemptions for no obvious logical reason.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee has also recommended the application of the efficiency dividend to property operating expenses. This may cause some shivers in the bureaucracy; however, the committee has also recommended that the rate of the efficiency dividend be reduced to one per cent, which will offset the cost of the addition of property operating expenses. This will also assist those agencies that already receive their property operating expenses in single-line appropriations and, as a consequence, are already subject to the efficiency dividend at 1.25 per cent. The committee was of the view that the efficiency dividend can be characterised as a blunt but effective instrument. It is unfair and takes no account of ability to pay. It does, however, yield results. It also keeps up the pressure to look for efficiencies and it does return a portion of those efficiencies to the budget.

          The time constraints on this inquiry have meant that the committee has focused fairly narrowly on the efficiency dividend and has not had the opportunity to examine alternative approaches in any depth. That does not detract from the immediate task, as the committee was of the view that there is no alternative to the efficiency dividend at this time. However, the committee was also of the view that alternative approaches such as workplace bargaining, resource agreements, market type approaches, evaluation programs and benchmarking offer a longer term alternative to the efficiency dividend. A broader approach to advancing the reform agenda has been identified in the management advisory board's recent report entitled

I start by recording an appreciation of the constructive approach taken to the issue by those who appeared before the committee. Australians are fortunate that within the Australian Public Service there are so many people who uphold the highest professional standards.

          I want to make a few points by way of highlighting some aspects of the report. The efficiency dividend is a rough justice system but it should be retained; it should be amended. It should be managed with more flexibility. The critical point is that it should be set at a rate that relates to labour productivity growth. The calculation of that figure is a vexed issue, so the committee has proposed a more careful analysis of the methodology to calculate such a figure. Setting the rate is a budget decision. It is a matter for the government. But the committee has agreed that it could range to two per cent. We have, with the assistance of the Department of Finance, provided figures to back that up.

          I would be remiss if I did not comment on the fact that this inquiry revisits an issue of contention about the possible gains from an increase in the efficiency dividend, which was the subject of political controversy when the opposition in its Fightback proposal suggested an increase of the efficiency dividend to two per cent. We calculated that it would bring in an extra $36 million in 1994 and the same amount in 1995-96. Finance at that time said it would only bring in $27 million and $36 million. We have now had the benefit of its further calculations on this matter. It says that it would actually bring in an extra $49 million in the first year and $48.8 million in the second year. The only thing I would say to our friends in Finance is that next time they are doing a costing for the government of an opposition's election policy they might do a more accurate job than they did last time. It just so happens that this time it suits them to up the figure and it is a very different figure from that which they gave us before.

          I think we can say now that next time they might be more careful, although the fact is that now we have the committee making it clear that a figure of two per cent is possible, and we have Finance figures giving us the revenue implications of that. If a political party decides to recommend that again we will simply use the committee's substantial justification and Finance's own figures to back it up.

          The second point I want to make is that, whilst workplace bargaining is only in its early stages, the evidence that we took about the operation of it would be disappointing for the advocates of it as it is currently undertaken in the public sector. I think it is a process which has much potential, but the evidence before the committee was basically damning. The committee went on to note that a more flexible system is needed. The committee also notes that more market type mechanisms are appropriate. In my view, this is very much an enlightened view which I strongly endorse.

          The third point I wanted to make is a more general one. I start with a brief quote from a United States federal public service report, which described the need for reform in the United States public sector. It asserted:

         The committee in its report has called for a comprehensive framework for public sector reform. I believe that this conclusion contained within the committee's report is very significant. The committee has acknowledged reforms to date but has called for more and has pointed to one option for the government and policy makers to consider, and that is the further adoption of market type mechanisms.

          There are many options to introduce market type mechanisms, including privatisation, corporatisation, developing agencies, decentralising functions, vouchers, contracting out, devolving responsibilities, introducing user charges, developing performance objectives for agencies and, in that context similarly, introducing citizens charters. In fact, the committee has raised the prospect of citizens charters and suggested that this is an area that could be further examined.

          I again strongly endorse that recommendation. Not only does it hold out the prospect of providing government with a tool by which it can assess the Commonwealth on services delivered, but also it can give the customers a benchmark by which they can judge the quality of the service being provided by government. That is not, as the US quote really enforces, a matter of political ideology; it ought to be a bipartisan view that can be shared within the parliament about the importance of delivering services in a quality way to the Australian taxpayer.

          As the chairman has noted, by the nature of the circumstances the committee's report was brought into the parliament at this time so that it could facilitate the government's budget decision processes. But we reported in the context of this broader reform agenda and indicated that the committee was prepared to have, and saw itself as having, a role in promoting further reforms. I am confident that, over time, that will be seen to be a far-sighted move by the committee to assist public debate and promote reform.

          My postscript to that is that, in addition to introducing market pressures, other related reforms could have been recommended if time had permitted and our terms of reference had been wider. The parliament has a role to play in developing and maintaining a public sector that meets the contemporary needs of Australia. The establishment of a more extensive committee system and the autumn introduction of the federal budget are policies that have been promoted by the coalition but which have now been adopted by the government. But there are other measures. Supporting the principle of a non-political public service, providing public servants with similar terms and conditions of employment as the private sector and transferring duplicated functions to the states are examples of additional measures that could be examined at a later time.

This report is but one of the important means by which Australians can demand that value for money. It is pretty clear that they are not getting it. That is not a criticism of the efforts of those in the public sector today. I have already acknowledged the reforms that have been undertaken. But a lot more could be done. The committee had before it evidence and submissions to that effect.

Further reforms could be undertaken which would provide a real dividend eventually to taxpayers, either through their having to pay less taxes and still receiving the same goods or, alternatively, by their continuing to pay the same level of taxes but obtaining a better result from the government.

         I draw attention to a speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 10 February 1993 before the federal election. The Labor government's role in women's access to the law and the duplicity of occurrences around the law which affect women indicate that this government under this Prime Minister and the previous one under Mr Hawke have been successful in not only putting forward rhetoric but delivering on that rhetoric. The national agenda for women that was put forward by the Prime Minister shows the extent to which there is a commitment within this government not only to talk about issues but to deliver on them. The real record for this government has been one of delivery.

         In the speech that I refer to, when the national agenda for women was launched, the Prime Minister indicated that women unanimously nominated three areas as being of pressing concern to them: child care; violence against women; and women's health. The record of this government in those areas has been exemplary. That is not to suggest that there is not a long way to go; there is. But there has been action by the government.

         Australia's recognition of women and their role within the law and the legal system goes back a long way. South Australia was the first state in the world to give women the vote. Australia continues to set the pace for democracy in issues relating to the status of women. The International Labour Organisation singled out Australia's achievement in reducing the gap between women's and men's wages. Under the centralised wage fixing system, with the protection of awards, women now earn up to 93c for every dollar of men's wages. By comparison, in Japan or the US, for example, women earn around 70c for every dollar that a man takes home.

         These are some things that the Prime Minister brought to our attention. Gough Whitlam was responsible for introducing the notion of equal pay for women. At that time, those opposite predicted that this would cause the vast unemployment of women. In fact, the employment prospects of women have not suffered. There has been an exceptional growth in female employment. In the past 10 years, the number of women in the labour force has increased by almost 40 per cent. Some benchmarks of this Labor government in the reform process include the Sex Discrimination Act and the affirmative action laws. Seventy-seven per cent of girls now stay at school to year 12. In 1983, when we took office, 40 per cent stayed. Fifty-two per cent of enrolments in higher education are now women, which is up from 46 per cent in 1982. These are just some of the things in which we have been involved.

         It is an empty gesture to now be talking about collaborating in some way between the relevant committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives to overcome a problem which you, Mr Acting Speaker, and the Assistant Treasurer have acknowledged is not new, and in the same breath to say, `Although the measure arose out of a specific piece of legislation'—that is, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993—`it shall have no relevance to it'. I am talking about the motion before the House to collaborate and refer to committees. Given the suggestion that has been made that the committee make its decision known before the end of May, we are now proposing quite clearly to pass a measure which gave rise to the concerns of the Senate, and gave rise to the measures now proposed, but to treat the concerns as if they do not exist in relation to the measure, which really is the initiating instrument—although that is a bad term.

         It is very difficult to understand how the government can, in all seriousness, divorce what is proposed by way of reference to committees of each chamber in an attempt to clarify the issues involved from the decision and, nevertheless, proceed to ram through the bill, including amendments from the Senate, in the circumstances described. It is outrageous and I think any reasonable person would have trouble understanding the logic of what the government proposes. I am wholeheartedly in support of the measure you have proposed, Mr Acting Speaker. I think the opposition would support it also—this is the first inkling the coalition has had of it, and we have not really discussed in any detail what is a tremendously important measure.

         The other thing I might ask—I will be brief because I do appreciate your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker—is for the government to give this side of the House at least an hour or so to discuss how we might react. It is difficult for me to do so on the spur of the moment, as it were, but it is possible that we might reach an accommodation. Otherwise, we are in the dilemma that I have attempted to describe.

It is not something to which the opposition has lent itself in the Senate. It has referred materials to us for us to consider. The way in which they were referred has been a matter of some discussion between us and the Senate for a period. Nevertheless, we have generally chosen to frame a set of amendments along the lines of Senate requests and send it back to the Senate. That is what the government intends to do now.

         I understand that it is not the Senate's intention that consideration of the bill, as opposed to the issue, be delayed any further in that place—subject to the government agreeing with the amendments that the majority of the Senate agreed to. So the principle, not the bill,  has gone to the committee of the Senate. We believe the same should apply here. The principle, not the bill, should be considered by our parliamentary committee and the committees ought to talk to each other and attempt to arrive at some unified position. It is not a proposition which we ought to have any difficulty resolving. The problem we would have if we suggested delaying this legislation until this issue were resolved is that there would be a lengthy consideration by—

It may take months for the committees to resolve the matter, and they may never resolve it satisfactorily. The issue may not be resolved until something is done that so offends a member of the public that that member of the public decides to challenge a piece of the legislation and take it to the High Court. In that case, a resolution of this issue may be years away, unless there is an agreement, which I think is unlikely, between the House and the Senate on how these things should be handled in the future. Of course, we cannot set aside all taxation legislation between now and when that situation occurs. I think the opposition in the Senate, including the other political parties that formed the majority on the amendments, very sensibly recognised that.

         We propose in this amendment to do more or less the same thing. I am most reluctant to delay the consideration of the bill any further. We have to consider the amendments themselves, which require debate in this chamber, as well as this particular issue. When that is completed, the bill has to be referred back to the Senate for its consideration. The Senate is operating under a strict timetable and will shut down at 10.30 tonight. I am afraid we cannot delay consideration of this bill for an hour.

         I ask the Leader of the House whether he would agree to put this matter over until 9.30 or 10 o'clock. We will find the suitable procedural devices to do that. I have just engaged in conversation with the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who obviously has an interest in this matter, and I would like the opportunity to seek the separate advice of the clerks. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) reminds me that we do not have any fundamental problems with the amendments. We are not arguing about the substance of the matter. If there is some doubt about the constitutionality of a procedure attaching to this bill, it seems to me wrong in principle for this House to pass that bill until that doubt is resolved.

         The procedure used in this bill satisfies the constitution by the way it has been presented; it has been presented by way of requests.

They have come to us in the form in which they would normally come to us and in the form that we would consider constitutionally appropriate. But the issue itself as to whether or not this is the appropriate way of dealing with the general proposition of amendments from the Senate is the issue that the Senate has referred off to its committee and it is the issue that we suggest we refer off too.

My threshold reaction is to agree to the reference to the committee. But, seeing that no damage is done if this is deferred until 10 o'clock, I would be quite happy with that so I can have discussions with the shadow Treasurer and the clerk, whose advice in these matters is always greatly valued by both sides of the parliament. If I have got that wrong, it is on my head.

         —As I understand it, and given all that has just gone before, it will be readily apparent to the chamber that there is a raft of amendments which have been agreed to by the Senate and transmitted to us, either in the form of worded amendments or requests. My first point is that it was both unnecessary and avoidable to have us discuss amendments from the Senate in this way. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and I had an exchange during detailed considerations earlier this week along the lines that we were quite well aware that we were going to be confronted with this. I remind him of that, although I know full well he understands the consequences of what we do in this place.

         There is absolutely no reason at all why we should not have considered these amendments in this place at the appropriate time. I know that at one stage, talking about a particular amendment I had moved—I think it was to clause 51, but time passes so slowly in this place that one tends to forget—the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said, `Well, we're not going to take that amendment here because it'll go to the Senate and it'll make that amendment'. That is damn fool logic by anyone's estimation and merely reinforces the long-held view that we have abandoned our legislative duties in this place and allowed the Senate to be the sole legislative chamber—but particularly in relation to taxation matters.

We could have gone through the same process which the Senate has gone through, avoided the need for requests and the complications of a constitutional nature, which we have just been discussing, had we accepted our responsibilities in this chamber in the first place. It is an old chestnut, but the simple truth is that the government's actions are making the situation worse with each year, with each piece of tax legislation that goes by.

         These amendments have been either requested or enumerated by the Senate.

Other associated issues involve the way in which the Senate has requested the House to make these amendments and the limited time frame that the members of this chamber have had to examine the issues involved. I remind honourable members that we have been presented with a raft of paper—in the order of 22 pages—and that I have not seen this document until very recently. Is it any wonder that we are held in ill repute as a legislative body, particularly amongst the professionals who have to work with the product of our inefficiencies and inconsistency?

         According to the supplementary explanatory memorandum, clause 48 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) provides that division 6 in the bill will apply from the 1994-95 income year. The explanatory memorandum to the bill stated that the grouping rules of division 6 should apply from the 1995-96 financial year. This amendment corrects the bill so that division 6 will apply only from 1995-96; hence it is a straightforward measure in that sense.

         One concern we in the coalition have, which Senator Watson has mentioned, is the bunching effect by which companies are increasingly having their cashflow tightened by these measures. The group test in terms of the company tax instalment rules differs from the group test applicable to the transfer of losses and other taxation matters. I ask the Assistant Treasurer: can the government explain why a uniform group test in the Income Tax Assessment Act is not the simplest and most efficient method? We would like some guidance on that matter.

         As those here should know, large companies are now required to lodge their tax returns on 1 December instead of on 15 March the following year, as was previously the case. This move will increasingly squeeze the cashflow of companies. It is made worse by the fact that companies must now cope with initial tax, quarterly instalments—contained in this bill—and extra taxes arising from the fringe benefits tax changes. These arrangements are causing a major negative impact on the cashflow financing arrangements of many companies. It cannot be understated.

         From time to time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as is his wont, berates the business community for not investing. Most recently he threatened wages pressure if the sort of investment he thinks should be occurring does not occur. In the same breath he and his ministers argue that, compared with other OECD countries, we are one of the lowest taxing nations.

         Whilst the raw figures might—I emphasise `might'—add some credibility to that claim, which is certainly arguable, we have the offsetting factor that the incidence of taxation here is quite abominable if it is compared with the OECD countries or, for that matter, with any other country. On top of that, we in this country have the highest compliance costs of any nation in the world, with the possible exception of the United States of America. So the argument that we are a low taxing country is relevant only when it stands on its own—not when the total cost of taxation is taken into account.

        This amendment is clearly aimed at protecting the government's revenue position from what must be said to be an inadvertent loophole.

Furthermore, the amendment will be backdated to 1 July 1988.

         We understand that there is effectively no retrospective impact. If there were, I can assure you, Mr Acting Speaker, that I would be adopting a different attitude. There is no retrospective impact because the tax commissioner has not allowed any claims. So no-one is in a position where he or she had something to pay back and could not reasonably have anticipated being in such a position. We do not oppose this amendment but we certainly have concerns relating to the government's claim of having consulted with the industry on this provision. In the limited time available to the government in drafting this amendment, and the even more limited time we had to consider it here, I seriously doubt whether the government has adequately consulted with the industry. To claim so is plainly fatuous.

         The constitutional issues relating to sections 53 and 55 have been spoken of frequently in the other place and directly impact on this bill. Is this bill imposing a tax or not? That is the fundamental question. It is clear that, with the inclusion in the bill of the two amendments now before us, the bill becomes a bill for the imposition of tax. It seems to me that that is patently unarguable, although I am sure the High Court would be able to arrive at a different conclusion; hence the Senate's decision not to amend the bill but instead to request that the House amend the bill. Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, has made the point:

        That is a matter of a separate motion, thank goodness. I observe that it is well known that the government and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs have differing opinions on whether a tax increase is legislation to impose taxation. It is a matter which should—and, I guess one of these days, will—be tested before the High Court. I acknowledge the comments of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that that might take quite a long time indeed. It should be tested eventually—and I am sure it will be—to avoid confusion, by clarifying the role of the Senate and, more importantly, the meanings of sections 53 and 55 of the constitution.

This can be seen daily as the Prime Minister threatens the Senate and increasingly moves against the states and the constitutional monarchy. Thank God we have the Senate and thank God the states maintain their support for the Senate. The Senate and the states are the only institutions restricting the Prime Minister's arrogant pursuit of absolute power.

         In relation to the question asked about grouping for company tax instalments: there are two tests, for two different purposes. The first one is a group test for losses, and it is 100 per cent. This is a narrower test because of the need to reduce the scope for avoidance. The second test, a 50 per cent test for company instalments, follows closely that used in accounting standards previously announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis).

        The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Migration Act 1958 as amended by the Migration Reform Act 1992. The reforms effected by both the Migration Reform Act and this bill are to commence on 1 September 1994. The bill also provides for consequential technical amendments to other Commonwealth legislation.

         The Migration Reform Act 1992 makes important changes to the Migration Act 1958. It seeks to simplify the legal basis for administration of entry to and stay in Australia. It expands merits review by the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal, and modifies appeal rights to the courts. It also establishes a detailed code of procedures for the processing of visa applications and reviews and clarifies the procedures in relation to cancellation of visas.

         The commencement of those parts of the Migration Reform Act 1992 that were originally to commence on 1 November 1992 was deferred to 1 September 1994 by the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1993. A major reason for seeking deferment was to allow for the making of a number of amendments, mainly of a technical nature, to ensure that the legislation operates smoothly. The bill now before the House contains the amendments which the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) foreshadowed last year.

         All the changes provided for in the bill are consistent with the principles and scheme of the Migration Reform Act, as enunciated by the former minister. Most are of a technical nature, correcting drafting errors, ensuring consistency of language or, in some instances, rewriting provisions to achieve the same outcome with greater clarity. The remainder of the amendments will ensure that particular migration matters are administered in a way consistent with the scheme of the Migration Reform Act previously passed by parliament.

         For example, one of the key objectives of the reforms is to clarify the status of all non-citizens in Australia. In simple terms, a non-citizen in Australia will be required to have a visa to be lawful. A non-citizen who does not hold a valid visa must be detained and is then subject to removal from Australia.

         Grant of a bridging visa will provide a non-citizen, who would otherwise be subject to detention and removal, with lawful status for a limited period. The bill provides for more than one class of bridging visa. This reflects the fact that bridging visas will serve a number of different purposes and will be granted on the basis of a number of different sets of criteria. The detail of the bridging visa scheme will be contained in regulations.

         The creation of a class of visas to be called special purpose visas clarifies the status of persons currently exempt from the requirement to hold an entry permit to enter and remain in Australia. Currently the Migration Act exempts from this requirement a variety of non-citizens, including representatives of foreign governments and their families, heads of state, military personnel from other countries engaged in military exercises, ship and airline crew in Australia for a brief period, and New Zealand citizens who present a valid New Zealand passport on entry. This exemption will not apply under the reforms as it is inconsistent with the principle that lawful status flows only from holding a visa.

         Special purpose visas will provide lawful status for non-citizens who are presently exempt non-citizens, other than New Zealand citizens, and will be held when, and for as long as, a non-citizen continues to be present in Australia for a specified purpose. These visas will not be subject to the usual provisions relating to visas such as the need for an application, the need for an administrative grant of the visa, and the need for the grant to be evidenced. This reflects the fact that many of the non-citizens who will be holders of these visas enter Australia in a manner that makes it impractical for the usual administrative procedures to apply; for example, foreign military personnel engaged in joint military exercises.

         New Zealand citizens will be granted special category visas at the border on presentation of a valid New Zealand passport.

         Another amendment which is intended to clarify the status of non-citizens in Australia is the creation of a new class of visa to be known as an ex-citizen visa. This amendment will provide that, while in Australia, a person who loses their Australian citizenship, for example, by acquiring the citizenship of another country, will be taken to be the holder of visa entitling them to remain in Australia indefinitely. This visa will be subject to the same cancellation provisions as any other permanent visa. Creation of this new class will avoid the situation where such persons could automatically become unlawful non-citizens, subject to mandatory detention and removal.

         Other areas where the bill provides for minor amendments are in regard to the procedures for considering visa applications and cancellations, clearance of arrivals at the border and in regard to review. Visa application procedures are to be amended to ensure that applicants can effectively nominate a representative to receive communications from the department and to ensure that applicants are given a greater opportunity to comment on adverse information about them which they may not previously have seen. The procedure for cancelling visas, where incorrect information has been provided, is refined in the bill to ensure that a visa holder has the opportunity both to show that incorrect information has not been given and, if the decision maker concludes that incorrect information has been given by the applicant, to show that there are mitigating reasons why the visa should not be cancelled.

         The bill refines provisions relating to the clearance of arrivals at the border to ensure the smooth processing of both citizens and non-citizens. For example, provision is made for the clearance of a person that a clearance officer knows or reasonably believes is an Australian citizen, even though the person may not have documentary evidence of their citizenship. There are also amendments to ensure that a consistent approach can be taken to all persons who arrive in Australia without a visa.

         The bill ensures that particular decisions that are currently reviewable on their merits remain amenable to review after 1 September 1994.

Proposed amendments also enable expedited review of bridging visa decisions where the applicant is in detention.

         In order to provide for smoother implementation of the legislation it is proposed that the Migration Act 1958, as amended by the Migration Reform Act, be renumbered. The insertion of a large number of new provisions into the Migration Act means that, without renumbering, awkward references to provisions such as section 26ZEA will result. The renumbering of the Migration Act will take effect on 1 September 1994. The bill also provides for consequential amendments to other Commonwealth acts, largely reflecting changes in terminology, such as the substitution of the term `entry permit' with `visa', and the creation of the special category visa for New Zealand citizens in Australia.

         Since the decision was made to defer the commencement of the Migration Reform Act there has been considerable activity within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in preparation for implementation of the proposed changes. As well as the identification of necessary amendments to the Migration Reform Act and other related legislation, significant progress has been made towards the drafting of subordinate legislation, the preparation of procedural instructions, and the revision of computer systems and data bases. In addition, a strategy has been developed for the provision of information and training to target groups, both inside and outside the department.

         It is essential for the successful implementation of the changes contained in the Migration Reform Act that many of these activities are completed well in advance of the 1 September 1994 commencement date. In particular, the act itself, the regulations and procedures, and appropriate forms need to be finalised, printed and distributed to all officers well before the commencement date so that they can become familiar with the reforms and be able to provide an effective and high quality service from the first day. Members of the public, including clients and registered migration agents, also need time to become familiar with the reforms.

         While much of the preparatory work is being done concurrently with the consideration by parliament of this bill, none of these matters essential for effective implementation can be finalised until the amending legislation is settled by parliament. It is therefore vital that the bill passes through both houses of parliament by early May. I commend this bill to the House.

         Let me say at the first instance that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, which makes changes to the Migration Act, as amended by the Migration Reform Act, will have the support of the opposition in this place as it had in the Senate.

         I am glad that the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) have placed their expectations on the record. I hope their expectations are realised, but it will be novel, given the experience in recent years of amendments to this legislation by this government, some of which were of major substance. The opposition has often facilitated the passage of those amendments and cooperated with matters that, if tackled in other ways, some might have seen as having undesirable consequences. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the hopes and expectations for the legislation have been largely unrealised. There has been an enormous amount of frustration and difficulty, largely because the government has attempted to undertake major reforms. Regrettably, either because of the complexity of the legislation or the lack of perspicacity on the part of the government, matters that ought to have been properly addressed were overlooked, and great difficulty flowed from that.

         The parliamentary secretary, as is his wont, waves his hands and grunts and groans to suggest a degree of difference of view on this matter, but my experience with this bill, which is now considerable, suggests very much to the contrary. Even when we had facilitated the passage of the Migration Reform Act, the most major reform following the 1988 reforms, the government still could not get it right. It had to ask for the postponement of the Migration Reform Act in order to further consider the matter. The opposition, in its usual cooperative fashion, acceded to a request to postpone the implementation. Now we have the legislation which presumably has got it all right. I hope the government's expectation that it has now got it right can be realised and that there will not be further legislation to try to clarify the matter.

         It is interesting to consider the matters that have been overlooked, and that is obviously the case. The first matter relates to a number of classes of visa. This bill creates three new classes of visa to cover people that the government tells us are already legally in Australia, but who previously under the Migration Reform Act would not have got a visa to evidence their legal entitlement to be here. So it is a pretty significant defect.

       <para first-indent="16">

         What are these classes? The first class is the special purpose visa. The second reading speech contained a list of the people for whom the government was not going to provide documentation to evidence their presence in Australia. Obviously that needs to be addressed. That is why we will not oppose this legislation. Under these special purpose visas, people will be able to fly into Australia and, provided the minister gives them a prescribed status and makes them members of a prescribed class of persons who have that status and declares that they have been granted a special purpose visa and has declared the class of persons of which they are a member to have been granted a special purpose visa, they will be taken to be here legally, regardless of whether they have something on their passports. I am told that that will apply particularly for overseas defence forces that might fly in and fly out on a special mission. I suppose that, as part of that mission, this is to validate their presence in Australia.

         The next class of visa is the absorbed person visa. The absorption principle was something that we were very familiar with and which the government did away with not so long ago. but the parliamentary secretary would have liked to have seen it returned. I do not know whether he will want to boast about it tonight, but the courts have recognised the absorbed person, under a doctrine which they developed and which was accepted in the migration legislation, as someone who had come into Australia illegally and had been able to remain here for a sufficiently long period that a judgment was formed that that person had been absorbed into the Australian community and it was then unreasonable to ask that person to leave. If one accepted that absorption as a valid principle, we would be saying to people, `At a certain point of time we are going to reward you for your action in making yourself an illegal entrant to Australia by granting you the entitlement to be here'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let us understand what has happened. People were or may have been absorbed under the principles that operated before 2 April 1984, which is when this principle was abandoned by legislative action. An absorbed person visa will be granted to a person if that person was in Australia on 2 April 1984 and had ceased to be an immigrant before that date—that means that they had been absorbed before that date—and if on or after 2 April he or she had not left Australia and if before 1 September 1994 he or she was not otherwise an illegal entrant.

         The parliamentary secretary might clarify this if he thinks it is otherwise, but my understanding is that this relates only to people who had been absorbed before 1984 under the provisions then operating. I want to be satisfied that there is no intention in this matter to introduce a new class of absorbed people who might be able to obtain this visa. My reading is that that ought not to be the case, but knowing the parliamentary secretary's interest in this matter I would not like to think he obtained his way by some sleight of hand. I am sure that is not possible, but his assurance on this matter would be of value to the House.

         We then move to the ex-citizens visa. It is interesting that, under the Migration Reform Act—the most thorough piece of legislation to review the Migration Act—we had people who were ex-citizens of Australia who might then have been still legally here not being able to have a visa that would evidence that. We are dealing with people who may have been in Australia and who, through some action on their part, presumably renounced their Australian citizenship but who are still here. We are trying to validate their entitlement to be in Australia. So this class of visa is to be for a person who has ceased to be an Australian citizen while in the migration zone before 1 September 1994, did not leave Australia after ceasing to be a citizen before 1 September 1994 and ceases to be an Australian citizen while in the migration zone on or after 1 September 1994.

         The rationale is that people may by some deliberate action have renounced their citizenship—particularly spouses of permanent residents. They may have renounced their citizenship under section 17 of the Citizenship Act, but they may have done it because they want to maintain a property interest overseas which is incompatible with their Australian citizenship. All of those sorts of situations arise and I suppose there could be classes of people like that for whom it could apply. But it is interesting that when we drafted this legislation it took this enormous effort, a whole lot of independent advisers and the postponement of the implementation of it to pick up such fundamental issues.

         The second major issue that has been dealt with is the removal of the dichotomy between approval and grant so that there is only one decision making process leading to the grant of a visa. I hope that helps to also remove some opportunities for doubling up in relation to, particularly in an appeal situation, an entitlement to a review of a decision. If it in some way removes one level of decision making that can lead to further administrative review, it is a worthwhile advance.

         Provision is also made so that protection visas may be granted as permanent visas. This reflects the decision of the government on 1 November 1993 that persons recognised by Australia as refugees under the refugee convention would be granted permanent residence rather than temporary residence, which was the policy when the reform act was enacted. Those words I have adopted—they were the government's words—belie what has been a major issue of some controversy and one which, I think, has a history that is worthy in this debate of again addressing.

Normally when people leave this place we do not suggest that they have given service other than of an exemplary and useful kind, but I have to say that I am one those who believes that the record of the former member for Fremantle, Mr Dawkins, was tainted in his administration of the system of selling Australian education abroad—a program he administered in such a way as to admit to Australia a host of people who became, even before the Tiananmen Square massacre, illegal entrants to this country.

         The parliamentary secretary grunts. I am not sure whether he is saying that I am wrong, in which case I would challenge it, or whether he is saying, `This is tiresome; why is Ruddock raising it again?'. That may be a part of what it is about. But the fact is that there were people here illegally under the arrangements that the government put in place. It left a heritage, which we are now dealing with, of some 40,000 Chinese students who, as a result of decisions the government has made in this parliament, will be permanent settlers in Australia despite being involved in an illegal act—that is, they were illegal entrants at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

         If I remember the figures correctly—and I am always happy to be corrected in relation to these matters—about 40 per cent of those present at that time were illegal entrants. The government, because it was not willing to grant permanent residency to these people immediately, embarked upon a series of quite erratic decisions—that would be the most complimentary language one could use about the nature of those decisions—whereby people who made certain promises were given temporary entry permits to remain in Australia until such a time, as it turned out, that the government decided to grant them permanent residency, which it announced in November of last year.

         When the government made a decision to grant all of those Chinese students four-year temporary entry permits it was faced with a situation that there were a host of other people who came to Australia as illegal entrants, or sought entry to Australia on other grounds, and who found it useful to apply for refugee status. We saw a blow-out in the numbers of people applying for refugee status. The numbers grew to about 2,300 people in a very short time and the government wanted to deal with that matter. How did it deal with that matter? It said to all of those people who were claiming refugee status: `If you satisfy nationally accepted definitions and establish that you are entitled to protection in Australia, we will grant you protection but we will not grant you permanent residency'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As a result of the decision in relation to the Chinese students, the government then imposed upon all of those who were properly entitled to refugee status—and it could have numbered some 400 or so folk; I think that is probably the numbers of people who out of that process to date have been granted refugee status—only a four-year temporary entry permit, or what we called a protection visa. So not only has the government given permanent residency to all the Chinese students who were here at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre and accommodated a whole lot of others but obviously it had to make a decision in relation to those who had the greatest need, the genuine refugees, those who satisfied the test, that they be granted permanency as well.

         So this decision, which deals with protection visas—and the entitlement is to be a permanent visa—reflects not the recognition by Australia that as refugees under the refugee convention they should be granted permanent residency; it reflects, in fact, the government's desire in this instance to put in place now a consistent regime, one which was Australia's longstanding practice and one which had to be abandoned because of the Chinese student decision.

Again, we are not opposing them. They include amendments to ensure that New Zealand citizens resident in Australia continue to be regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of acquiring citizenship.

         Let it be understood that there has been an historic relationship between Australia and New Zealand where we have essentially had in place common border arrangements. I am worried that the efficacy of those common border arrangements is being challenged, sometimes by decisions on this side of the strait and sometimes by decisions on the other. It is important that the efficacy of these historic arrangements—which are unique and which I think constitute the only reasonable arrangements which discriminate in relation to people's entry to Australia on the basis of their country of origin, and which are in effect grandfathered—be maintained by the action of both the government on this side of the strait and the government on the other side of the strait.

         I would not like to think that New Zealanders, in terms of the administration of what is, in fact, the common border, digressed so widely from our own criteria for determining entry that backdoor migration to Australia was possible for classes of people who would not access Australia by first going to New Zealand and then seeking to come to Australia. It troubles me from time to time that New Zealand is in the business of structuring its migration program in a way which may put some emphasis and weighting on country of origin or race in determining entry. If that were the case, it would be of concern to me because I do regard non-discriminatory criteria as being of the utmost importance. The latter provisions ensure that New Zealand citizens being parents of Australian-born children will be treated as permanent residents for the purpose of the Australian Citizenship Act.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another matter which I regard as important allows deferral of consideration of citizenship applications for 12 months while a person is under investigation which may lead to a visa cancellation or criminal charge. Of concern to me in recent years have been situations which have arisen whereby people who might otherwise have had their visas cancelled because they were improperly obtained—and it may have been because they entered into a sham marriage—went out and obtained Australian citizenship as quickly as they could after they obtained permanent residency improperly in order to avoid the consequences of the fact that their original entry may have been improper or illegal or improperly obtained.

         If this enables those matters to be addressed, it is a worthy advance. I would certainly appreciate clarification of all of the situations, and I could go through a list of those that were of concern to me. I hope that the 12-month period will be sufficient. I would have thought it would have been better to be able to cancel citizenship if the original basis upon which permanent residency was obtained was a sham or fraud. I would like to think that citizenship could be cancelled because it was based upon a flawed entry. If 12 months is the only avenue we are going to have, while we will support it, I do not think it goes far enough.

         In the five minutes that are left I want to pick up several other matters of concern to me. I have indicated that this migration reform bill has the opposition's approval, but the opposition has been concerned and remains concerned at the extent to which resort to judicial review is being utilised in numbers of cases for the purpose of delaying inevitable decisions that might require people to be removed from Australia. Where judicial review becomes an abuse of process—and I think there are cases where that has now become quite evident—one has to look at whether the access to judicial review is appropriate when more than sufficient administrative review processes have already been put in place.

         Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would know that in relation to refugee determinations and decisions taken under the Migration Act we have two systems of administrative appeal—one to the Immigration Review Tribunal and another to the independent body, the Refugee Review Tribunal—which are now in place and which ought to provide that protection. In effect, if those bodies were acting unconscionably—heaven forbid that that should happen—nobody could be denied access under the Australian constitution to approach the High Court of Australia.

         But, in my view—I have put this point before, and my colleague in the other place who now acts in this portfolio area, Senator Short, has re-emphasised it—there is a proper concern about the extent to which the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act has been available in relation to migration decisions. The Migration Reform Act repeals that entitlement but substitutes now codified provisions in relation to providing specific access to judicial review on the basis of reasons outlined in the Migration Reform Act. Our view is that there is still the potential for an abuse of process in the large number of grounds that have been provided in the Migration Reform Act. For that reason, we will continue to monitor that matter most closely.

The honourable member for Calwell is no longer a member of that committee, but he may be interested to know, if he has not read the report in relation to detention practices, that there was again—with a notable dissent from one of his colleagues in the Senate—a concern expressed about the continued access to judicial review in this area.

         It has come to light recently in terms of comments that I have been receiving as I have travelled abroad that the special assistance category, or SAC, is one that potentially has the ability to distort the migration program quite significantly. It is a fact that our humanitarian program—it now comprises 14,000 places and primarily in the past was intended for refugees and those who satisfied special humanitarian criteria but who were not quite refugees and for technical reasons did not get there—was intended for those classes of people.

         That total program has now been absorbed to about 50 per cent by this new category. This category comprises people who are not refugees but who are presumably the most needy. It almost includes those who have not quite special humanitarian needs. It also comprises those who are chosen on the basis of their country of origin.

From my experience here, which has not been over too many years, few people on either side of the House have the command of the law in this area of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). However, I find from appearing on committees with him that even he is sometimes surprised and informed by departmental people as to a number of the legal points in this area. Considering the amount of time the honourable member spent dealing with concerns about judicial review and giving us his thoughts on abuses in the system through the wide recourse to legal appeals, he should have welcomed the government's decision to try to get things right in this piece of legislation.

         As I have indicated, at the end of the day we are substantially reiterating what the 1992 legislation set out to do. We are reducing the possibilities of those very appeals and lengthy periods of litigation that are so dreadful. As I have indicated, the legislation represents a tidying up of the 1992 legislation. It also encompasses measures to amend a variety of other pieces of legislation, including the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Immigration (Education) Charge Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act.

         A variety of visas are established through this piece of legislation. A range of protections are offered to individuals. Their right of review and their right to put forward information to the department are also contained in this legislation. Amongst those visas are the special purpose visas, which apply to those now exempt from the need to have entry permits. They encompass a diverse range of people, such as ship and air crews, people from Norfolk Island, representatives of other countries who come here for diplomatic purposes, and military personnel. Further, these provisions also allow the minister to facilitate the visits of people in very urgent situations, such as funerals. They also encompass the right of the minister, where it is not `in the public interest' to reveal the individuals, to name those individuals and the purpose of their visit.

From 1 March, domestic protection temporary entry permit holders will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. All applicants seeking domestic protection temporary entry permits will be deemed to be seeking permanent residence. Between 1 March and 1 September, when this legislation operates, they will receive entry permits. All successful new refugees will receive permanent residence. As the previous speaker indicated, we are basically enforcing the decision of the government last year that changed the original intention that refugees were here only on a temporary basis to their being here on a permanent basis.

         Amongst the other changes is the issue of New Zealanders who were previously covered by special provisions. Under these measures they will continue to have travel facilitation. They will have no requirement of authorisation for travel prior to visits. Whilst there will be exemptions for those with criminal records held and those previously removed, essentially there will be no practical change in their situation. The previous speaker also detailed citizenship rights in this country and qualifying periods. The situation is that their residence in this country will be counted towards the period of permanent residence. One of the changes is that people will have to answer claims of incorrect information. They will have to give reasons why they got visas. Evidence of the circumstances will reduce the crime of giving incorrect information.

The government made 21 amendments and is trying to convince us tonight that it followed a course of action that is simple. One of the objectives of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which we are dealing with tonight, is to simplify the immigration documentation of visas and entry permits. You could have fooled me! The government has come forward with three definitions which will give it great difficulty in administration.

         Let us go back to 1989 when there was the significant difference of approach between the parties to the way in which immigration should be tackled. The government chose to go the legalistic way because it thought it was fairer, and I acknowledge that. But it is not fair; it is harsher, less flexible, and harder for people to understand. The government is realising five years later that what we were saying at that time was right. The migration committee in 1992 had a review and in its recommendations it stated that:

        Then a list of four items was run off, including all classes of visa and entry permits which can be applied for in Australia, discretionary components of decisions relating to those classes of visa entry permits and decisions to cancel visa entry permits. By that time my colleague the honourable member for Berowra was tearing his hair out because, the government having put the law in place, he was given the job of trying to get a reasonable result out of this constantly shifting target and hearing the stories of the community about the legal processes involved. The honourable member for Berowra is endeavouring to try to participate in this process and here is the government with its first statement—extend the review rights to practically anything that moves. No wonder it has problems.

         Prior to the government coming along with the Migration Laws Amendment Bill in 1993, and following this report and the legal process, it decided to instigate a bill to amend the Migration Reform Act 1992. But before the jolly thing could come into action on 1 November 1993 the government had to move amendments to it so it was postponed for practically one year until September 1994. We are still picking up the bits and pieces. Tonight we are picking up part of the 21 amendments made to this process since 1991. It is only a three-year period but the government has made 21 amendments to the act and attendant acts. The government has not got it right yet.

         Let us come to the legislation that is before the House tonight and look quickly at some of the main purposes. One of the main purposes is to establish different categories of visas but, broadly, the purpose of the legislation this evening is to make changes that provide for three new classes of visas, which cover people legally in Australia who are not eligible for a visa as proposed by the Migration Review Act,  and to provide for technical errors and some changes to citizenship law.

         What are the proposals for the new visas? The special purpose visa is for people who have a prescribed status. That means that the minister or somebody is able to say, `We want these people to stay in Australia' or `They ought to have a right to stay here'. The minister may invent on an ad hoc basis an immigration program all of his own under this proposal. I do not expect that he will, but the minister may declare that a group of people have a special purpose in being in Australia and should be granted a special purpose visa.

         Then there is the absorbed persons visa, which I spoke about earlier. These visas are for people who have been in Australia since prior to 2 April 1984 and who have ceased to be immigrants before 2 April 1994. I guess the definition of the act shows what ceasing to be an immigrant means. That is a very interesting point because, as my colleague the honourable member for Berowra has pointed out, that presupposes that at some point in time a person ceases being an immigrant and is absorbed. How do we enforce that rule? Is it a capacity to identify with Australian culture? Is it a capacity to speak English? Is it a length of time? Is it the fact that they have married or are raising children here? What is the criteria the government is going to use to decide whether a person is absorbed or not?

         This is a ridiculous concept. It cannot be applied with any objectivity whatsoever. The Labor Party certainly claims that it is on about objectivity in the immigration process.

         Absorption was a constitutional doctrine, I understand, developed by the High Court in the ex parte Walsh and Johnson case. It was a doctrine stated by Mr Justice Starke in that case. He set out the concept of what absorption really meant. We have picked that up and written it into the law. It is not the first time that this parliament has made a decision of that type based on some quite strange notion presented by a judge in the High Court.

         Then there is the ex-citizen's visa for people who suddenly decide that they do not want to be Australian citizens anymore but want to retain the right to go on living here. If they give up their citizenship, maybe an assessment ought to be made of whether they qualify to remain as permanent residents of Australia. I cannot see why the government has to raise these complicated concepts. The concept that it is raising here is making more definitions, more court cases, more lawyers wealthy, and more people unhappy because of the complexity of what it has done. The creation of this new class will avoid the situation where such persons could automatically become unlawful.

On top of that, we had to make decisions under the regulations to create special visa classes for PRC and other nationals. That was a shameful thing. Ultimately, the government made that decision because people had stayed here long enough and had been persuasive enough in the election campaign.

         Under the regulations we have recently created special visa classes for PRC and other nationals—a carte blanche decision to allow complete entry and permanent residency of a whole class of people based purely on the time that they entered Australia and their nationality. I cannot remember that ever being done before: based purely on the time they entered Australia and their nationality. There are poor old retired Brits around the place that do not know whether they are Australians or not. The government will not pass anything to help them out of their trouble. I do not believe that we should necessarily do that, but the government is prepared to pass regulations willy-nilly based on race and the time of entry to Australia to give people permanent residency—something that they had not earned or deserved.

         I am for case by case decisions. That should not be moved away from. The government must stick to that if it is to retain integrity and any semblance of a non-discriminatory program—something that the government espouses and talks about frequently. If the government wants it to be selective but non-discriminatory, it has to do it case by case and be fair internationally, not just to the electorate or the people supporting the government in the campaign. It has to stand on its feet internationally. The government should be proud and prepared to do that, but it has not done that. It has wrecked the Australian immigration program, and I am concerned that decent people who espouse good causes have been sucked into supporting a program that, through indolence, connivance and weakness, corrupted the whole process of immigration to Australia.

We have had a very wide ranging discussion. Much reference has been made to various matters in the past and selective views of history, especially immigration history, have been put. Members of the opposition forget the fact that I was chairman of the committee dealing with migration regulations for a record seven years. I know something about the history. It was very interesting to hear the honourable member for Mitchell suggest that the opposition was entirely opposed to the regulations process. He failed to mention that that occurred when he was the shadow minister.

When he was replaced as shadow minister by the honourable member for Berowra—the then honourable member for Dundas—the honourable member for Berowra came to an agreement with the government on the regulations approach. The essence of that agreement, if I correctly remember it, was that certain provisions, like sunset provisions, would be added to the regulations and, most importantly, that the then Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations be formed with the task of going through all of the regulations to determine whether significant amendments should be made.

         The honourable member for Mitchell might recall that there was some urgency in the meetings of that committee. I can remember endless days and evenings of meetings when that committee—of which the honourable member for Berowra was a member—went through and found a number of problems with the regulations, as a result of which we then put amendments in place. In addition to that, we determined that a number of key issues were encapsulated within the regulations concerning policy determinations. The charter of the committee was drawn up after the election of 1990 in such a way that we could look into policy issues as well as regulation questions. The committee then produced reports in areas of concern to the honourable member for Berowra, including three matters that have been mentioned here today.

         There was the report on illegal immigration. That was when the issue of absorption was raised. Then there was the report on marriage and de facto relationships—one of the most important reports in international terms to analyse the issues concerned with immigration and marriage. Then there was the report on refugee and humanitarian issues. Following each of these reports, the government adopted a number of recommendations. Sometimes the committee was so concerned about the need for urgent action that the government adopted preliminary committee reports as a matter of policy in order to ensure that the regulations were put in place.

         In 1992 the government decided to introduce the reform act. After all, the regulations approach had been a new approach in immigration. It was decided that a number of important drafting and conceptual issues had to be resolved about the application of the regulations and visas. These things have now been resolved in the act. The act ought to be welcomed from the point of view, as the honourable member for Mitchell mentioned, of simplification and clarification and making it easier for people.

So, although we have had a learning process in relation to this whole regulations approach—there is no doubt that we have had a lot of angst about it—as a consequence of that learning process, we have been able to put this bill into place which will achieve a very good result in making the law fairer, simpler and better to implement.

         —And other places. For example, I know that Sri Lanka is a concern of yours, Mr Deputy Speaker. These places have been identified. Cambodia is another one. What is the honourable member for Berowra suggesting? Is he suggesting that the introduction of this category will somehow create massive problems in the immigration program. Why? It is simply a humanitarian version of our general refugee conception. Basically, it is a humanitarian version of our refugee conception. The implication of his comments was that people will be coming into the country willy-nilly. That is not true. In many cases people have to establish some connection with Australia—relatives, sponsors or some other connection that they may have with Australia, as in the case with the Cambodian category.

         The special assistance category is one of the most important humanitarian measures that we have put in place. I congratulate the ministers not only for putting it in place but also for persisting with it. It enables us to deal, in a quick way, with problems that arise around the world. The minister is able to declare a particular area of the world as coming under that category and, therefore, can deal quickly with it.

         To suggest there is some problem with the special assistance category is quite incorrect. I am surprised at the honourable member for Berowra. After all, he is a member of Amnesty International. He berates the government from time to time on human rights issues for not doing sufficient for individuals who may be in difficulties. I am really surprised at him raising this issue. As I have said, this is one of the major humanitarian categories in which we can do something—and do something concrete and quickly. We do not have to wait around for people who are in totally distressed circumstances and then say to them, `You prove to us you've been persecuted by some regime'. What a nonsense. Imagine saying to a refugee from Bosnia-Herzegovina, `You prove to us that you've been persecuted specifically by this group or that group'.

         The UNHCR definitions have an important role but, in certain circumstances, are too narrow. This category takes that into account and gives special consideration to those people. It is a great humanitarian act. It not only is a very important part of our general refugee humanitarian program but also plays a significant role in our foreign policy. Australia's international reputation has gone up as a result of the introduction of this category. This category can be used to allow people to come from these places and, as I have said, we are able to make decisions quickly.

         Both the honourable member for Berowra and the honourable member for Mitchell raised the question of the decision concerning the Chinese students. We know the opposition's position on this matter. We know of the position that the honourable member for Berowra has sustained for a number of years. He put it into the report. Those opposite managed to get a majority on the parliamentary committee because some members of our party decided that they would not go along with the determinations made by the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the Chinese student issue. If anyone wants to traverse all the decisions in relation to that matter, the fundamental point was that a Prime Minister of Australia made a commitment to a particular group of people about their future.

         The honourable member for Mitchell talked about people's futures. We made a commitment to people on the basis of an assessment that they potentially would be in danger if they returned to their country of origin. Our international reputation as a nation was going to be judged on the basis of that commitment. Irrespective of whether the commitment was right or wrong or should or should not have been made, the fact is that it was made. To suggest, after a Prime Minister had made such a commitment and people were entitled to believe that they would at least be protected for a time, that it was then possible to turn around and go against that commitment is a nonsense.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not know that the purpose of parliament was to avoid debate. The honourable member for Berowra made a number of criticisms of the government on this matter. I am trying to reply to him. He seems to think that whenever one replies to his criticisms, one is not entitled to make a valid point. It is as though the whole of morality and integrity lies on the view that he has held. If he had persisted with his view, he knows very well it would have meant the expulsion of more than 20,000 people from this country who would not have been eligible for the criteria which he would have put into place. These are people who had been promised by the former Prime Minister that they would never be required to leave against their will. That is the reality.

         There is no attempt to be sanctimonious. It is a simple fact that the situation which these people found themselves in, not as a consequence of a decision which they made, but of a promise made by a former Prime Minister, and reinforced by the current Prime Minister, does place and did place obligations on us, and we had a very important moral obligation to meet them.

         The honourable member for Berowra also raised the question of citizenship cancellation. He asked why it is that if we detect that somebody has made a false statement, we do not then cancel their citizenship, even if the 12 months is up. I do not think he quite understands the provisions. I had better go over this situation because it might be important.

         The situation is that the 12 months applies in the case where the department suspects that there may have been a non-genuine situation, for example, a non-genuine marriage or something of that sort. The department is able, without going to a court, to exercise a power to defer the matter for 12 months. The provision of cancelling citizenship where one goes to a court and establishes that a person has made false declarations applies irrespective of any period of time. So there is clearly a difference here. As far as I understand it, the provisions with respect to citizenship cancellation where one applies to a court and establishes that a person made false declarations will still apply, irrespective of the period of time. With this measure, we have given a 12-month deferral in relation to the matter.

This clarification of the act will be of great importance in getting our immigration system together, and I welcome it. I ask that the House approve it.

         As I pointed out earlier, this place and the political spectrum is littered with individuals—the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) knows what I am talking about—who are very heavy on rhetoric and very light on action. I am privileged to be in the same government, the same House and the same party as the Attorney-General, who has taken a new line. He has put the rhetoric out and is acting upon it, and he is bringing a commendable set of changes to the legal processes of this country.

         The Minister for Justice has also made remarkable contributions. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice, along with our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is the guiding light—the philosophical leader—in this regard, have done amazing things in terms of recognising the discrimination women have faced within our society. But they are not just recognising it. As the right honourable member for New England would know, it is easy to recognise but it is much more difficult to have the intestinal fortitude—I will refrain from using that other more coarse word—to do something about it.

         The Minister for Justice also made another landmark speech, `Half by the year 2000', in which he put forward his view that more women should be in this place. In regard to the report

          Equality before the law

         , one should surely take note of the under-representation of women in this place. I subscribe to the Jim Carlton view that the only way to get equal representation is to legislate; it will not voluntarily be done by parties. It seems to me that the most logical way to do that would be to have male and female members in each electoral seat, elected by all people within the area. The thing that attracts to me to Jim Carlton's proposition is not the duplication or the larger number of politicians that would be around—I personally would like to see the states as part of that process—but the fact that one day we would not have equal representation and the very next day after that election we would have equal representation.

         We should remember that this is the centenary of voting for women in South Australia. It has taken 100 years of struggles to get the meagre representation they have today. I do not want to see women, being 50 to 51 per cent of the population, take another 100 years to get what they are entitled to. The Minister for Justice has put himself on the line and has indicated where he stands on this issue. My view is that we should take Jim Carlton's position seriously and when we do change the nature of our political system, which I believe is inevitable, use the politics of inclusion and ensure that there is equal representation.

Since the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act, there have been a number of strategic and important amendments to it which have gone further to make sure that women have the right to live their lives free of discrimination and enjoy equality before the law. Amendments were made to the act to insert a definition of `family responsibilities', to prohibit dismissal of an employee on the ground of his or her family responsibilities and to prohibit direct and indirect discrimination against workers with family responsibilities.

One particular campaign is the consent campaign for young people, `No' means `No'. Resources will be put in place this year to enable that community message to go out and be sustained.

         I comment on access to legal aid in this country. One of my constituents was recently denied legal aid by the opposition's mates in New South Wales. Her case concerned access to her children. She has already had one child taken away from her and her case concerning two other children is still pending in the court. She asked for legal aid, but she was denied on two counts: firstly, that there was no benefit for her and, secondly, that she would not be subject to severe deprivation if not legally aided. On both of those counts, I suggest to this house that having custody of one's children is a major issue. The opposition's mates in New South Wales have a lot to answer for, when we consider those people who are trying to keep their families together and look after their own rights, but have them taken away from them.

The dynamic duo of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice have taken on the legal profession and those who think that they are above the law because they control it—the justices. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice said to the justices, `You must be aware of gender; you must broaden your aspects; you must understand that there are people other than white Anglo-Saxon males'.

         The Attorney-General has taken the courageous action of ensuring that there will be a broadening of the base in the non-judiciary and the judiciary. What that means in a multicultural country in which 51 per cent of the population is female is that we will not only find people in black gowns who are white Anglo-Saxon males. We may even have a mixture of males and females who do not happen to have a Celtic background. We may have some Asian judges with an Australian background. We may even have some black judges with an Australian background.

         These actions portend well for the legal system in this country because we will have a broader base. So when cases which require someone with a broader view of the world are put forward, they will get some representation. We will have people who have a broader understanding of the world—not this narrow, parochial view of people holding those positions now. I do not claim that all judges are bigoted and narrow-minded. Many of them are very good people. But we need to understand that some of those people are captives of their generations, as are certain people in this House. They are caught up in that and they cannot escape it.

As honourable members may remember, the proposal for the report was launched at the National Agenda for Women function at the Bankstown town hall last year in the lead-up to the 1993 federal election. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the plan to commission this report at that time. It was the result of a lot of disquiet expressed by many women in the community across the board about the disadvantages that women suffered at the hands of the law. It was brought to a head at that time by some of the pronouncements of certain judges in rape and sexual assault cases.

         It was extremely productive and it formed the basis of the submission that I made to the inquiry. On that occasion I had women from women's health centres; Quota clubs; women's refuges; neighbourhood centres; my local university, the University of Western Sydney; and the Union of Australian Women. I also had women from different legal professions, either in private practice or from community legal centres. I had women from youth refuges and the older women's network. As can be seen, a broad cross-section of women attended. Others attended simply in their own right as individuals.

         A number of issues came out of that consultation. I must say that it was extremely lively. It went on for probably twice the time that I expected it to. At the end, the women were calling for another meeting but, unfortunately, we did not have time to do that.

         I would like to go over some of the issues brought up at that consultative meeting. First and foremost of those concerned Aboriginal women. The Aboriginal woman who brought this issue up in fact worked at the local women's refuge. She pointed out something that the rest of us simply did not know at that time; that is, the Aboriginal Legal Service is unable to act for Aboriginal women in cases of domestic violence because it is also obliged to act for the men. So we are faced with something of a dilemma. I think it is appropriate that we have an Aboriginal Legal Service that works for Aboriginal people who have problems with the law, but, unfortunately, most of the Aboriginal women do have problems with domestic violence and, as the service is obliged to act for the husbands as well, this simply is not possible. Whether we call for a separate service to service those women or whether they have to go to independent legal advisers is something that I think we need to resolve.

         Another issue was social security. It was felt by most of the women at the meeting that there is an assumption of women's dependency on men in most of the dealings with the social security system. I referred to a matter in this place shortly after my election—I seem to remember that it was the first time I was heckled by the honourable member for Bennelong. I mentioned several cases where women had been charged with obtaining a benefit illegally from the Department of Social Security when, after obtaining a benefit as a sole parent, they cohabited with a man and did not declare a change in their circumstances. I agreed that the women ought to be brought to account for those misdemeanours, but I was very disturbed at the fact, as were these women at our consultative meeting, that the men concerned got off scot free. I am glad that since that time the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has rectified that situation. But it does show that the social security legislation is geared towards that dependency of women on men.

         Most of the women felt that there was a fundamental, systemic bias in the law. They felt that piecemeal reform to selected areas may be inadequate unless the underlying assumptions are questioned and changed. For example, the concept of reasonableness has been applied in ways which do not adequately take into account women's reactions to situations such as domestic violence. Criminal law defences of provocation and self-defence need to be looked at from a woman's point of view. Similarly, some women in genuine fear of spousal violence have difficulty convincing a magistrate that their fear is reasonable if their circumstances do not seem frightening from a male outsider's point of view. The possibility of getting government funding for an organisation that could run test cases on issues of particular concern to women was also discussed.

         I think we can see that this report, certainly from my own experience, has been based on listening to women. I listened to the women in my electorate and the Law Reform Commission certainly has listened to the women who made submissions to it. There are a number of issues we can raise from that. The importance of the investigation by the Law Reform Commission is that it highlights women's actual, lived experiences of the law. Nobody can point to any actual law which clearly has one rule for men and another rule for women, but the totality of the administration, resourcing and attitudes of the system of justice in Australia often has failed or disappointed women who have sought protection or restitution.

         This particular woman was subjected to violence continually by her husband. When she fled, she left her young son.

The father died and the young son is now recovering from his injuries. Her evidence was given to the inquiry before that incident, but the effects of that are recorded in the report.

The facts are that men get 63 per cent of legal aid money. Legal aid prioritises providing representation for people charged with crimes, mostly men. Victims of violence, mostly women, get little or no legal aid to assist them to take steps to obtain protection orders or compensation.

There have been a great deal of submissions to this report and even in this short time there has been an unprecedented level of public interest in the inquiry.

         Women in my electorate in far north Queensland welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the Australian Law Reform Commission's inquiry and lodged a comprehensive submission, which I am pleased to say is liberally quoted in chapter 2 of the interim report. The Australian Law Reform Commission also held public hearings in Cairns in September 1993. It is very important that the voices of women in far north Queensland have the opportunity to be heard in this inquiry because all too often previously they went unheard because of isolation and remoteness.

         Women in my electorate face the same obstacles to access to justice identified in the interim report as women Australia-wide. These are: lack of awareness of their legal rights and of legal services, the fact that key players in the legal system—police, lawyers and the courts—often do not understand or respond appropriately to women's experiences, and the fact that women are often financially less well-off than men and therefore less able to meet legal costs. As well, the report highlights the inaccessibility of the courts to women due to factors such as lack of child-care. Obviously these factors are shared by women in my electorate, but in addition, women in my electorate, women in communities such as Cooktown, Weipa, Coen, Thursday Island and even the more remote communities in the Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait, also have to deal with problems arising from remoteness and isolation.

         I see that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is here. He has been here for a long time. He represents the National Party of Australia. One of the trends worldwide is that rural women have taken on more and more in the rural crisis that has occurred worldwide as a result of factors such as the decrease in commodity prices. Women have taken on more and more of the farm duties. There is considerable statistical evidence to back this up. This means that women in rural communities face more adversity. They are in remote areas. They are faced with more and more duties in the home, more and more responsibilities on the farm, and yet they suffer from all the problems of remoteness. This report highlights those difficulties in relation to the law.

I would wager there is not a Queensland government minister over the last decade who has not received a letter from Joan. She was an especially vocal opponent of the repressive policies of the National Party government in Queensland. She is also keeping Premier Goss on his toes. Joan has provided submissions to just about every inquiry into issues affecting women in Queensland and the nation and she singlehandedly produces a monthly newsletter that keeps all of the mailing list up-to-date with issues that concern women in Cairns and around the country.

In this regard I fully support the commission's recommendation that, as part of a national women's justice program, a toll-free telephone legal advice and referral service be available to all women in Australia.

         Similarly, there is an urgent need for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women's legal service around the country to address the particular obstacles barring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women from equality before the law. As the honourable member who preceded me indicated, there is a real problem with Aboriginal legal services representing people in domestic violence disputes as well as family law matters. Obviously, a solicitor from the Aboriginal legal service cannot represent both sides in a domestic dispute. So in effect—and I have seen it in real life as a solicitor—what happens is that someone is told to go away: `You cannot have legal advice if the other party is Aboriginal. We will act for you if the other party is a non-Aboriginal, a European, but we cannot act for you if it is a dispute between  Aboriginal people'. There is really only one solution. I say to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch): we have to provide a separate service so that both sides can get representation.

         These are important issues. The sad thing—I know this from having been a practitioner in Far North Queensland—is that this matter affects both people who are charged in the criminal courts and victims of crime. Quite often, victims of crime are women. The fact is that, in courts in Far North Queensland, no real effective interpreter service is provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. English is basically a second, or perhaps third, language for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the remote regions in my electorate.

         In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to see the Attorney-General at the table. He came to Cairns last year. He met and heard first-hand about the obstacles to justice facing women in my electorate in the far north. He made it clear that he was personally committed to addressing women's inequality before the law.

         In the short time I have left, I will mention another matter that particularly concerns me which is raised in the report. There is a problem that comes from remoteness and one submission referred to this problem. Page 36 of the report states that country towns often have only one or two solicitors. Small communities, such as those in my electorate, are lucky to have one solicitor. There is one solicitor in Cooktown and a legal service in the Torres Strait, and that is about it. It is very difficult in those communities—the solicitors are usually male and they obviously have more social contact with males—for women to get any sort of legal advice. That problem, which is highlighted in the report, flows from remoteness.

         I must say that that problem comes through this report in relation to my electorate. There is the dual problem of all the issues of inequality that women face plus the issue of remoteness. It is a double whammy that women in my electorate have to endure. I am sure that it will be further developed in the concluding report that the commission will be bringing out in terms of this reference. I urge the Attorney-General to think about it. Unless we address these problems, we are not serious about equality. If we are serious about the equality of women, we have to talk about the equality of women throughout this nation and not just in the populated regions. Again, I commend the report. I commend the Attorney-General and the commission for their work on the report. I look forward to the next report with great relish.

In fact, they will probably be listening with bated breath to everything I say, as I am effectively breathing down their necks as I speak.

         I am delighted as a woman member of the government to see the very serious law reform agenda that our ministers are embarked upon. This goes back to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Half way to equal
         </emphasis>
         report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs with which the Attorney-General was involved. I will first outline the obstacles that the report has highlighted as women seek to have access to the law. I will then discuss the issue of violence in the lives of women and the importance of dealing with that through more effective access to the law.

         Obviously the report highlights a lack of awareness of the law and legal services. If women are to achieve social justice, they must be able to access justice. It is certainly true that some of my male constituents have a firm belief that legal aid services allow women to access the law and not them. But the truth of the matter is that our legal aid resources are very limited. More importantly, women have great difficulty accessing information and advice as they confront a male dominated hierarchy. The report states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Inadequate information and poor advice leaves women unprotected. They are likely to remain in unacceptable situations or to endure violations of their rights simply through lack of knowledge of alternatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is true of many women whom I have counselled in my professional career.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second obstacle outlined in the report is the lack of awareness by police of women's needs and experiences. In spite of many of the achievements in domestic violence legislation in state jurisdictions, it is true that women suffer secondary victimisation and alienation if they attempt to access protection through the police system. While there are many excellent police officers, it is still true that there is a culture that is dismissive of women's needs. I will refer to that later in my speech.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third obstacle outlined in the report is that legal service providers fail to provide accurate and appropriate assistance. The report goes on to say:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Women's legal services express concern about the large numbers of women who come to their services complaining of legal workers, such as solicitors, chamber magistrates and local court staff, giving women incorrect information or inappropriate advice, especially about avenues for help in domestic violence and family law matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fourth obstacle is not surprising; that is, legal costs. The costs of justice are a recognised problem for most individuals. However, because women are generally poorer than men, cost is a greater barrier to them in getting legal help. As I said, legal aid is not adequate in this regard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We have to remind ourselves of the importance of legal representation. Given the difficulties that women encounter, to then effectively represent themselves in courts will often mean a miscarriage of justice; in fact, most magistrates will adjourn cases and seriously encourage women to seek legal representation so that there will not be difficulties as they attempt to get their rights attended to.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fifth obstacle is inaccessibility of services. As the previous speaker, my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) mentioned, this is particularly true in remote and regional areas of Australia and certainly in central Queensland where women are living in small towns where there is no legal representation available at all, and it is even more difficult. Inaccessibility relates to access of child care and women being able to get to centres for advice. That is a very important issue. The report suggests a national women's justice program. It states:

        This is a very large agenda but it is essential if women are going to have access to social justice in this country. I want to refer to the issue of violence, which was highlighted in the report. As has been quoted in media references to the report, the report starts with a disastrous experience. It states:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One woman's experience demonstrates the importance of this reference. The woman appeared at the Commission's hearings and spoke of her fear of her partner's violence. He had recently been awarded custody of their child. Less than a month later the Commission was told that he had shot the child and killed himself. The child is now recovering. The work on this reference assumed even more relevance and importance.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is fair to say that many of us have been fortunate that our direct life experiences have not included the sort of violence that is the experience of many women. In my counselling, I certainly have had to deal with women who have lived for years under constant threat, women who have slept on the side of their beds to avoid sexual harassment and rape from their partners. To talk to people about such issues is ultimately humiliating for women. For many years they have kept silent about the sexual abuse they have suffered as children and the sexual molestation and harassment they have suffered from the people who are supposed to love and care for them.

They must have access to services. I would suggest a family centre where they can have access to legal advice, counselling and financial management services. Above all, it should be user-friendly. Women should feel that it is okay to be able to talk about experiences that are ultimately painful and humiliating and know that they will be accepted. Unfortunately, their first port of call is often to a local police station where, because of historical reasons, they are met very often by a male law enforcement officer who is very dismissive.

         We can understand that this is a very difficult area of policing. Very often hardworking and hard-pressed police officers go out of their way to help women in situations of domestic violence only to find those women return to the situation of violence and intimidation. This can lead police officers to say, `Well, you cannot help these people. They must enjoy it'. Mr Acting Speaker, I can tell you that women do not enjoy violence.

         On International Women's Day I was attending a function in my electorate when a very nice woman said, `It is no use talking to the politicians or the law because they won't help us. You have to go out and do your own thing'. I found this a most distressing resolution of the problem because the reality is that, unless the law and the political system address issues of violence against women, violence in families and violence and harassment in the workplace and in the schools, we will continue to perpetuate a situation of inequality.

         It is certainly true that in any year eight, nine or 10 classroom—in fact, any year two, three or four classroom—peer group relationships are already being established based on inequality, a lack of respect and valuing of women. For example, very often in year one, two, three and four classes children get into groups. They might be called `wombats' or `koalas'. Sometimes they are called by the favourite toys that are around—Barbie dolls or whatever the latest space age or television toy is. Boys do not get into Barbie doll groups very often. So girls have to accept the male dominated hierarchy without any complaint. We have to be aware that the causes of social inequality are very deep. They reach right into family life, into parenting. I quote again from the interim report:

         The Commission knew that violence was a serious problem for women but the intensity and uniformity of the women's submissions brought home to the Commission that the link between women's inequality and violence was fundamental. The legal system's tolerance of violence against women underwrites women's inequality before the law. Women cannot be equal until the legal system responds effectively to violence and until women are treated as equals, violence against them will not be reduced. The experience of violence is in itself disempowering for women and impedes their access to legal services.

        So what we have here is one aspect of attempting to deal with the experience of inequality and discrimination that women face each day. Our government is committed to real reform in the legal system, to real accessibility for women in the workplace without harassment and discrimination, to child care and to the needs of women in part-time work. We have a huge agenda to reform those issues for women.

         It is very important that we go out and explain our very effective policies for women. One of the ways we will do this is by encouraging more women into the political process—more women members in the parliament on both sides of the House, more women into the ministry and more women into the cabinet. We cannot afford any longer to forget about over 50 per cent of the community.

         I will use the Australian public sector as an example, because it is the area I know best. It is unbelievable when we look back into the first half of this century and realise that in the Australian public sector, and indeed probably in most parts of the work force, women were excluded from most areas of work other than the lowest paid areas, like typing pools and other low-paid clerical assistant-type jobs. I am talking about office work mainly. There are a lot of other traditional areas of female employment, like nursing et cetera, but we will find that most of the areas of traditional female employment are the lowest paid.

         It was not until 1949 that women were able to work in areas other than the very lowest level in the Australian Public Service. In those days, the Australian Public Service was broken up into four divisions and women were barred from all areas except the fourth division, which was clerical assistants and typists. It was not until 1949 that that was changed by the Chifley government and women had access to all areas of employment in the Australian Public Service—but only if they were single. It was not until 1966 that the marriage bar was lifted. Before 1966, if a female was employed in the Australian Public Service—and probably in most state public services for that matter—and she got married, she had two choices: either she became a temporary employee or she resigned. That was a pretty blatant example of the discrimination that existed in our work force fairly recently—less than 40 years ago.

         It was not until the early 1970s that the fairly celebrated equal pay cases were fought and won, and women finally started getting equal pay for equal work. That is gradually permeating its way through. We still have women earning on average less than men because they still tend to occupy lower paid jobs. At least in situations where they are doing equal work of equal classification they do get equal pay. It is worth reflecting once again on the opposition's obsession with the trade union movement, which was exemplified during this week with it criticising and attacking trade unions all the time. It was the trade union movement that won for women the right of equal pay for work of equal value.

         In most states of Australia, and in the Commonwealth, we had equal employment opportunity legislation passed in the 1980s. It is worth noting that without exception all the legislation relating to equal opportunity, whether in the Commonwealth area or in the states or territories, was passed by Labor governments. The New South Wales Wran government was the first state to pass equal opportunity legislation, in 1981. The Commonwealth, I think, was the next.

         —The Wran Labor government, that is right. The Hawke government followed in 1984 with the first of a number of pieces of legislation on equal opportunity when it amended the Public Service Act to provide for equal employment opportunity in the Australian Public Service. There were further pieces of legislation carried down through the 1980s which affected statutory authorities and the private sector. But, like most social change and most social justice initiatives, it was the Labor Party that effected these changes. It is just as well that we do have Labor governments in this country otherwise we would still be living in the dark ages with massive discrimination against women and other sections of society as well.

         —The one thing she did not mention was that the opposition has only four on its side. When I went to school 10 beat four any day. It is pretty rich for someone to come in here and lecture the Labor Party in a patronising way, like the honourable member did yesterday in the grievance debate, about not promoting women in parliament when we have 10 on our side and the opposition has four. Just for the record, 10 out of 80 is 12 1/2 per cent—that is not flash; I agree that we should have more. But the opposition side has four out of 65, which comes to about six per cent—less than half the percentage for this side of the House. How dare the honourable member for Moncrieff come into this chamber lecturing and criticising the Labor Party's record on allowing women into parliament.

         At least the Labor Party is having a debate within its own party forums about the need for more women in parliament. I have not heard much from the other side about women in parliament. The only time we ever hear anything from the other side about women is when it is promoting one particular woman—the candidate for Mackellar, who is apparently going to come back into this parliament next week. That will increase the opposition's numbers to five. That is a bit of a step forward, I suppose, depending on which way we look at it. The only time we ever hear anything from the Liberal Party about promoting women is when one particular woman promotes herself and her own leadership ambitions—the person who has modelled herself on Margaret Thatcher, who is hardly, I would have thought, a great advocate for the progression of women's rights. Nevertheless, what an outrageous and hypocritical tirade we had yesterday from the honourable member for Moncrieff when she came in here and spent 10 minutes attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), attacking the Labor Party, and lecturing us of all people about the need to promote more women in parliament. I found it absolutely outrageous.

         It is the Labor Party that leads the way in this country on social change and on social justice. I also congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the minister at the table—the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr)—and everyone else involved with that report. It is a Labor government that is producing these works and these reports. It is also showing that in an important area such as the legal system we do need to address issues of access, equity, equal rights for women, equal rights for people with non-English speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal people, people with disabilities, and a whole range of other minority groups who have been historically disadvantaged in this country—particularly because of the long periods that coalition governments have served in this country.

         Let us face it: when Menzies was here women had to resign from the Australian Public Service if they married. That was an absolutely outrageous situation. There were not too many women in parliament then. The Liberal Party has never been at the forefront. We never hear it promoting women. At least the Labor Party is debating the need for more women in parliament, which is more than I can say for people on the other side.

         Another great area of social change and social reform is child care. Child care is not only a women's issue. Nevertheless, the huge increase in federal funding for child care and the implementation of child-care programs since 1983 has provided greater access for women to go into the labour market. The increase in labour market participation by women has been immense since 1983 when this government was first elected. One of the reasons that women are better able to access employment and go into the labour market is that they now have a better chance—I recognise that we still have a long way to go—of finding child care. The provision of child care is essential for men or women to be able to access the work force.

         These issues are very important. The opposition, as usual, trivialises and downplays these issues because it has no agenda of its own. It has no policies, it stands for nothing; yet it lectures the Labor Party about some of our policies and our record on social justice. At least we believe in social justice, access and equity in the work force. We will do something about it and have done a lot about it. We will continue to push ahead with reforms that provide better access and better government programs which will enhance the opportunities for women to have equal access to all areas—whether it be employment, the legal system or elected office. So I welcome the opportunity to speak on this particular debate. I am proud to be a member of the Labor Party—a party which believes in social justice. I commend the report to the House.

This furniture replaced existing garden furniture which was in poor condition. The purchase was recommended by the Office Establishments Trust and purchased by the department with the approval of the previous occupants of the Lodge.

        (1) The ASC is an independent statutory authority established under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 to regulate companies and the securities industry. The ASC is accountable to the Commonwealth Parliament through the Attorney-General. In the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers, the ASC is not subject to any directions other than those given under sections 12 and 14 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. Under section 12 the Attorney-General may give a written direction to the ASC about the policies it should pursue or the priorities it should follow. In the public interest the Attorney-General is empowered under section 14 to direct the ASC to investigate a particular matter. However once an investigation is commenced by the ASC, the Attorney-General has no power to direct the conduct of that investigation.

        The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) established its Fraud Awareness Unit in March 1993. From this point in time, all matters relating to fraud have been consolidated. Prior to this, the information was held in a variety of locations in the states and regions. To collect and assemble the information in respect of the matters referred to in the honourable member's question would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in assembling such information. However, ATSIC provided the following information based on records currently available.

However Queensland and Western Australia chose not to transfer domestic meat inspection responsibilities to the Commonwealth and Tasmania resumed responsibility for domestic meat inspection in that State in 1991. The Victorian government has indicated that the arrangement under which the Australian Quarantine and Inspection service (AQIS) provides domestic meat inspection in Victoria will terminate on 30 June 1994.

        Research was undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation into aerial firefighting capability in December 1985. The results of the study indicated that the use of large fixed-wing aircraft for fire suppression was neither cost-effective nor suitable for Australian conditions, due largely to the greater intensity of eucalypt hardwood fires when compared with softwood fires of America. The report also noted that availability of suitable water supplies in the bushfire season is also a limiting factor whereas in countries such as Canada there are large bodies of suitable water for this purpose. In addition, the research indicated that all aircraft would have failed on the major fires of Ash Wednesday.

        The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme is a self-employment assistance program. An evaluation described in the Report found that of the 2,750 who were assisted in this program in 1991-92 some 1,760 were still self-employed after assistance ceased and that they were employing 880 others. When applied to the 3,350 commencements in 1992-93 this implies some 3,000 jobs. While all NEIS jobs are required to be additional, it was assumed that only 85% of these jobs were additional in order to produce a more conservative estimate.
