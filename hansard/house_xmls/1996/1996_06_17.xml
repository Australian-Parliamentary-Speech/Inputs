       Fifteen were from the Special Air Service Regiment, which is based in Swanbourne in Western Australia. Three were from the 5th Aviation Regiment, which is based in Townsville. Hence, communities from one coast of the continent right through to the other have been affected. The men came from Western Australia, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. With an average age of nearly 30, they were skilled and at the height of their competence. Selected to perform most difficult tasks under most difficult conditions, they trained rigorously and carefully to give us an important military capability. They were well prepared, but their work inevitably carried great risk. This risk they accepted in order to serve Australia and to protect all of us.

       Our Defence Force has responded to adversity in a way that does it immense credit. Those immediately at the accident site itself acted with courage and discipline. Since then the army and other services have moved warmly to embrace and support the bereaved. I can promise the House that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the government as a whole will ensure that everything that can be done is done to extend comfort and support in these sad circumstances to the injured and to the families of those who died.

       A memorial service was held in Townsville last Friday. A national memorial service was held in Canberra earlier today and was attended by many members of the House. It was a very moving, dignified service. Tomorrow there will be a service held in St Mary's Cathedral in Perth which I, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot), the Minister for Defence, the Minster for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and the Governor-General, amongst many others, will be attending.

       Mr Speaker, on the night before the terrible accident at Townsville, you and I, and many others, shared the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an opportunity for us to express our solidarity with and our celebration of the achievement of that wing of our defence forces. I and, I know, everybody else were tremendously impressed with the dignity, the bearing, the good grace and the good disposition of the men and women of the Royal Australian Air Force. It was a sheer delight and privilege to share that occasion with them.

       Within 24 hours, the whole nation feels a sense of great sadness and a great solidarity with the people who have been killed, with their relatives, their friends and their loved ones. It is an event that has shaken many people. The great strength that these wonderful men have displayed in such adversity is a tremendous inspiration and a reminder that the old&amp;hyphen;fashioned commodity of personal courage, dignity and strength in a time of bereavement and sadness is a very important component of national life. They have done us great pride. They are an ornament to the Australian Defence Force, and the Defence Force itself is an ornament to this nation.

       The government will investigate the circumstances of the accident carefully. An investigation team was on site immediately, and a formal board of inquiry has been convened.

       Mr Speaker, on behalf of the government, and I am sure with the support of all members of this House, I wish to honour the men who died in this accident; to give thanks for those that survived it; to commend the service men and women who responded so courageously at the site of the crash recovering the dead and rescuing the injured; and to record the supportive and professional assistance rendered by the local Townsville community.

       In that context, I want to interpolate my thanks to the newly elected member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who contacted me on the night of the accident. In fact, it was his message to me at the Lodge when I was dining with the Premiers that gave me the first news of this tragedy. I know how tremendously supportive the member for Herbert has been to the local community and how he has, as one would expect, discharged to the full his responsibilities as a representative of that community—and, of course, the army personnel are very much of the heart and soul of the Townsville community.

       There is always about our defence forces something of a cloister. They do gather together to share conjointly the tragedies that from time to time beset them. Nothing happens in one branch of the service that is not felt deeply elsewhere—as I had occasion to know, as I had the privilege to visit Swanbourne barracks on Thursday morning to talk with the chaplains and the troops who had been all night counselling the families of the dead.

       There is an enormous reserve of courage in our defence forces—moral courage as well as physical courage. To be able to deal with these sorts of problems when they occur requires people to draw on their resources of moral and physical courage. That was in ample display to me last Thursday morning.

       We are very lucky in our service personnel. The average age will surprise people, I think. As has been said and as the Prime Minister has revealed, the average age is about 30. That is because we could have not got in the two branches of the army a more intensively selected group of men, both in the 5th Aviation Regiment and in the SASR. The refining fire they have to go through to achieve the positions they do is beyond the comprehension of any but a few members of this parliament, some of whom have been through it themselves at least to a small degree. It is beyond the comprehension of most, and it does not come at a young age.

       As a result of that, instead of—as often is the case after defence accidents—our consoling mums and dads and sisters and brothers, now we are consoling whole families because a tragically high proportion of them were married and have left bereaved large numbers of women and children. One, indeed, had five, and it has been more than something of a shock to confront those—although I have not met them yet—or speak with those who have been dealing with that large bereaved family.

       Service in the SAS in particular is dangerous. Something like 17 soldiers have been lost in training since the formation of the unit in
       <break page="1929" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        1957—nine in conflict, 17 in training. The training that they do has to be realistic. The training that they undertook in this particular exercise probably means more to us in this House than does just about any other form of training the defence forces undertake. This was counter&amp;hyphen;terrorist activity. There is no doubt at all that individual members of this House and collectively members of this House rate high on the list of potential targets that these units train to rescue, should the politics of our nation become as benighted as those of a large number of other nations. They, of course, train not only to assist us but also to assist the community generally who may be victims of terrorist activity.

       This is a highly honed unit at peak readiness, training constantly on the edge in order to be able to sustain that capability. It is not a capability that anyone can walk into overnight, even somebody who has been trained in that capability. It is one where you are only as good as your last training exercise and only as good as the realism of it. The realism of this exercise has obviously produced a set of circumstances of great tragedy.

       No unit in war would expect to suffer these levels of casualty. This is an extraordinary proportion of the unit, an extraordinarily high percentage of the counter&amp;hyphen;terrorist capability. It will take the SAS years and the 5th Aviation Regiment some time to actually make up the consequences of this loss.

      <para first-indent="16">
       The folk who participate in these organisations, as I said before, are so highly selected that you cannot immediately walk out and select another 18 to replace them.

       As a Western Australian, this has very particular meaning to me and I am sure to all other Western Australian members of this parliament.

I also acknowledge that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) travelled to Townsville.

As the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel pointed out this morning after the service, they bleed and are cut to the quick when these horrific accidents happen. They show it in their own ways. They maintain their esprit de corps, their sense of duty and the need for life to go on in the military circumstance.

         —I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 95th Inter&amp;hyphen;Parliamentary Union Conference held in Istanbul, April 1996. At the outset, I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his agreement that I lead this particular delegation to the IPU conference. As he was aware, I was in the position of  being between and betwixt, being a shadow minister and being the deemed Speaker. I was still in that capacity, therefore, as the Chair of the Australian National Group of the IPU. Again, I thank him most sincerely for giving me the opportunity to say goodbye to some cherished friends in that organisation.

        It was a very useful conference, as they seem to be, Mr Speaker, as I hope you will find in the future. I was accompanied on this particular occasion by the honourable members for Groom (Mr Taylor), Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and by Senator Wheelwright. We were ably looked after by Peter Keele, the secretary, and by Pam McDonald from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Three major items were discussed during this conference—the protection of minorities, the fight against terrorism and the protection of world fish stocks—as well as a whole range of other matters. The importance of a conference of this nature is that it allows the opportunity to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         network with members of parliaments from right around the world so that your ideas on democracy, your ideas on how you do things in your own country can be transmitted. At least you get an opportunity to talk with people about those issues.

        One of the highlights for the Australian group was a speech given by Senator Wheelwright in the course of the general debate. He chose to give a summation of Australia's attitude to French nuclear testing. During his contribution the French delegation continued to interject by turning their microphones on and screaming out, `Non, non; it is untrue,' and so on. Senator Wheelwright was undeterred and continued to give a great summation of this country's attitude to that particular matter. Might I say that, at the conclusion of his speech, he was given a standing ovation by the delegations that were present—and that was almost all of them—as he returned to his seat.

        Over the last three years that I have been involved with the Inter&amp;hyphen;Parliamentary Union, it has provided me, on behalf of the Australian national parliament, with a chance to represent all the interests of honourable members here. I hope that I have done so to the best of my ability and in a way which has brought credit to this parliament. Mr Speaker, as you now take over that particular position as the Chair of the Australian National Group, I say to you in all sincerity that this organisation can do some good work. It is in need of some change. I do not think the members that have been to it before would disagree with that. I think the financial circumstances of the union need to be examined. Perhaps one option should be that instead of holding the conference twice a year it be held once a year. Perhaps there should be a review of the mechanism by which items are considered on the agenda for debate. Nevertheless, all of the delegates from Australia on this particular occasion—as they have during the past three years—played a champion role in advancing Australia's interest and the parliament's interest at the IPU.

I had been there some 12 months earlier and did not accompany my colleagues on this particular occasion. Nevertheless, I think the manner in which our colleagues worked well together on this occasion, the way in which they were prepared to debate the issues and the manner in which they continue to bring credit not only on the Australian parliament but also on themselves are reasons why this particular delegation should continue.

        I would like to make a plea, though, and it is one which, regrettably, on a couple of occasions I was not able to sustain: that is, as an Australian parliament we should always seek to have as the minimum one representative in the Australian parliamentary delegation from the female members of this place. I know that in the past the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has done an exemplary job on behalf of the Australian parliament at the women parliamentarians' segment of the IPU conference, and I would like to thank her for that. Her involvement started well before the Canberra conference in September 1993 but certainly blossomed after that when she chaired the women's parliamentary conference here and continued to play an active role.

        A number of supplementary items were discussed at the conference. As the honourable member for Cunningham has indicated, the item that was decided upon was terrorism, but a very important supplementary item which was debated as to whether it should go on the agenda was the ban on antipersonnel mines. Regrettably, we failed by a very narrow margin to get that up in the plenary.

The delegation's official visit to Sri Lanka was a very short one—only four days—before attending the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Colombo. Even though we had only such a short time, we were able to see a surprising amount.

         The visit to Sri Lanka took place from 3 to 6 October last year and was the first visit there since 1986. At the time of the visit there had been considerable change in Sri Lanka and hope for a resolution to the long&amp;hyphen;running conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and militant Tamil groups, most prominently the LTTE. Even though we only had four days, we were able to talk to a wide range of people about the prospects for an end to the war and about trade and investment matters.

         We met with a number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, Mrs Bandaranaike, who became the first woman Prime Minister in the world in 1960. She has since had two more periods as Prime Minister and has played a major role in Sri Lankan politics and government.

         In all the meetings we had with both ministers and opposition party leaders, a genuine commitment to achieving peace was evident. It is very disappointing that hostilities have since been renewed. A solution must be found soon if Sri Lanka is to continue to attract foreign investment and trade and halt the devastating cost of the war—not only economic but also in lives and social and political upheaval.

         A highlight of the trip was the opportunity to visit some of the projects being undertaken with Australian aid funding.

         It was at one of these projects, located not far from the Tamil held areas, that we were reminded of the realities of the war.

Ngereteina Puna of the Cook Islands were instrumental in the preparation of a petition expressing concern about the testing of nuclear weapons by France and China. The petition endorsed a declaration made by the Australian Pacific regional conference of the CPA earlier in the year and called on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The petition was signed by more than 100 delegates at the conference. The Commonwealth Secretary-General agreed to convey it to Auckland for the attention of the Commonwealth Heads of Government.

         I want to make two other comments. One is in relation to the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group. We have just had a report from an IPU delegation where reference was made to the meeting of women parliamentarians at the IPU. I am aware that the meeting of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group grew out of the experience of women from Commonwealth countries attending Inter&amp;hyphen;Parliamentary Union conferences and having experience of that group. I am sure that male parliamentarians wonder why it is necessary. It is simply this: without women meeting together to make their input in a particular way it has been the experience of these conferences in the past that certain items simply are never raised for the agenda. There are certain items that for some reason or another are of more concern to women. They are a concern, of course, to the human race and the joining together of women parliamentarians in a mutually supportive way has contributed a great deal to discussions at conferences both of the CPA and the IPU.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is one other comment I would like to make that I think is of particular significance to CPA conferences. This was the first one I had attended. The big difference between CPA and IPU conferences is the participation of Pacific delegates. The IPU is basically too expensive for Pacific countries to belong to apart from countries such as Australia and New Zealand. So the Pacific voice is rarely heard there, except when it is expressed by Australian and New Zealand delegates. I would, therefore, particularly welcome the fact that the CPA conference gave those small Pacific nations the opportunity to participate fully.

         —The government has been stung by the introduction of the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill sufficiently to put to a committee's examination the harsh and unconscionable conduct by large business against smaller enterprise. The committee represents evasion. It is an opportunity to go around the garden yet again on an issue which has been done to death in debate on the Trade Practices Act. It is a matter on which small business and their organisations have detailed, longstanding positions. The government's intention is for a committee's deliberation, followed by a further consultation, followed no doubt by an election and we start all over again.

        They made amply clear in opposition that they did not want to support small business on this issue. Here is their chance again. We will take responsibility for the legislation. We will do the job they squib. They can let the legislation through on the nod, therefore not earning the hostility of their friends in big business.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Small business do not dance to the Liberal ideology. They are heartily tired of hearing their mantra about red tape. They have noted the minister's backing away from his commitment to a 50 per cent reduction of red tape in the life of this parliament. They are not a bit surprised. Cutting red tape is much more a local and state government problem than it is a federal one. The federal government is in charge of the Trade Practices Act and here they should expect action from the national parliament. The government well knows that
        <break page="1936" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         this is the issue that small business identifies as its No. 1 priority and that there is daylight between this and all the other issues that the government wants small business to be interested in.

        The bill I present today modestly and carefully deals with this problem of harsh and oppressive conduct. The bill is not a substitute for sound judgment and the need to address commercial reality by business people. It does not protect business from bad judgment or the consequences of shifts in the economy. Nor does it undermine the privacy of contract. It does not prohibit harsh outcomes. Agreements freely entered into and consequent of full disclosure must stand.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill deals with pre&amp;hyphen;existing relationships. The reason for this limitation is that, however painful the decisions, businesses that have no sunk costs in a commercial relationship can walk away if the terms and conditions are not commensurate with the returns. It is about commercial relationships that are of major significance to one of the parties to the relationship. It is not a bill to provide relief from every activity that is irksome.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill prohibits exploitation of a party denied commercial choices by virtue of the particular relationship they have with another firm. It is confined to the exploitation of that particular relationship. A company that chooses to engage in a common set of conduct across all commercial relationships is not exploiting any one particular arrangement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In markets where competition is reduced, the existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act governing the misuse of market power prevent the exploitation of firms. This bill addresses discriminatory conduct where a company exploits a particular relationship to seek extra market rents unsustainable in the open market.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It encourages good voluntary codes. Many landlords have adopted practices that recognise their mutually dependent relationship with tenants. Recently, the Builders Owners and Managers Association and the Retailers Council of Australia have started to encourage better business conduct between the parties they represent. This bill supports these changes in leasing practices by capturing those
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         firms that refuse to comply with the industry developed norms of behaviour.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill, with the other provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974, provides a legislative safety net for industry codes of practice, reducing the level of regulation that would otherwise be necessary for many industry sectors. By testing adherence to self&amp;hyphen;regulatory codes as a factor which a court may have regard to in determining whether conduct is harsh or oppressive, the bill explicitly recognises the important role that these codes play in establishing acceptable standards of business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, the bill is about changing the way firms interact so that those with significant interdependence cannot ignore the impact of their decision on those bound to them. Small business enjoyed a massive expansion whilst we were in office. Seventy per cent of our record job growth occurred in small business. Recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been prepared to admit that he came into office with the economy in a sound condition. It is so because we were prepared to be responsive to the needs of business within the framework of a wider protection of public interest. Our experience and, more importantly, the experience of small business determined that this bill presents a course that must be followed. Stop the evasion now. Bring the bill on for full debate. Pass the bill. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.

       Soon after I became the member for Murray, a number of elderly people began to present themselves to my office. I presumed that they were bringing to me their concerns about their own futures as elderly, frail people with limited incomes, mostly dependent on some social security payment. Rather, their concerns were wrapped around the fact that they were carers of disabled adult sons and daughters and, in some cases, grandchildren.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As their own lives advanced, they were becoming less able to keep up the very difficult job of 24&amp;hyphen;hour care for the disabled members of their family. They were becoming increasingly concerned that there were not the services available in the community to support them, to give them ease of mind that, if they should pass away, their sons and daughters would have some accommodation with the level of support that they had been able to give as parents. They were concerned that they would not be able to find respite care. As you can imagine, if you are in your seventies or eighties, giving 24&amp;hyphen;hour care gets too much from time to time and you need to have time away, perhaps to meet with other members of the family.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Too often, in my own electorate, the only place to put these adult sons and daughters with intellectual and/or physical handicaps is in acute beds in hospitals so that their carers can have some time out. That is obviously not what acute beds are intended for and it is not a cost&amp;hyphen;effective way to go about giving respite care, but it is the only option for too many people who find themselves in this very difficult situation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       If you have a wheelchair you obviously need special transportation. If you are living in the country often the payments available now are not sufficient to get your son or
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        daughter to therapy sessions or to meet with others. These people are often aware that there are services somewhere else, but they cannot access them because of transport costs or the difficulty of transport.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Very often ageing parents have limited knowledge of what is available or they are confused by the complexities of the state or Commonwealth programs offered. For example, if you are born disabled and are registered soon after birth with that particular disability, a range of services and facilities flow in your direction. If you become disabled later in life—for example, you acquire a brain injury—a different set of circumstances go into motion. It is more difficult to access those same services if you acquired the injury later in life.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is not just my Murray electorate that has 40 or more people in their seventies and eighties taking care of substantially disabled sons and daughters. And can I mention a grandparent who is looking after his teenage daughter with muscular dystrophy. He himself is in his eighties. His wife died recently. You can imagine the extraordinary anxiety he now feels for the welfare of his granddaughter.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In fact, the most recent Australian Bureau of Census and Statistics figures tell us that there are more than 7,500 carers in this category. We can expect over time that substantially more people will enter this type of family care. We know that more people survive brain injury as adults and more people born with disabilities survive to live long lives and, we hope, lives which are meaningful for them.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       At the same time, families are often smaller than they were before. Family networks are less prevalent in our society. Families are more mobile. Too many of our families are broken up with husbands and wives going in different directions. So, in the future, we cannot imagine that we will be able to depend on this pool of caring parents who will pick up the burdens of a disabled son or daughter and carry that burden for perhaps 30, 40 or more years of the life of their sons and daughters.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I am not saying that the previous government ignored this problem. In 1991 the
       <break page="1938" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        Commonwealth and state disability agreement looked very carefully at how the responsibilities and tasks of caring for the disabled should be divided between the states and Commonwealth. That three&amp;hyphen;year agreement is to be renegotiated this year.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In the early assessment of how that agreement delivered services to this disabled area, we have to be substantially concerned. What has been found in this early assessment—and what my older parents are saying to me—is that the agreement has, very largely, failed to deliver its objectives.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We have cases where there is incredible bureaucracy, inflexibility of program delivery and problems in defining or attempting to define categories of disability, which make it a nightmare to try to work your way through if you have a son or daughter with a multiple set of disabilities. Too often if you have shared Commonwealth and state funding there is a tendency for one or the other to try to move the disabled into another category where the funds will not be drawn from your particular area.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As COAG moves into the scene, there has also been an endeavour to try to deliver the services within a market model. We must always ensure that economic efficiencies are achieved within a most humane set of understandings about the needs of the disabled. But there is a real fear—certainly in the last three years—that the disabled and their carers have not been served well by the CSDA.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In bringing this matter before the House, I ask that we call on the negotiators, who will meet at the time of the mid-year review of the three&amp;hyphen;year Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state disability agreement, to give very particular attention to the level of service now provided to the disabled and to their needs and to their carers. I call upon the governments involved to very urgently implement an appropriate action plan following these negotiations. There are too many disabled individuals who are not receiving the attention our society should be giving them and their carers.

        —While I share the concern of the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for the increasing numbers of ageing parents who are carers, especially sole carers, of adult children with disabilities, I do think from a policy point of view it is wrong to focus only on the needs of one particular group in a way that could lead to artificial distortions in our response to a larger area of need.

       The proportion of the population over 65 is predicted to double over the next 60 years—a rise from 11 per cent to 22 per cent of our population. These figures come from a paper which I would also recommend to all those members of the House who are concerned about this issue of carers—an excellent paper prepared by Mary Lindsay called

       Another major statistic—and I will stop with the statistics after this one—is the rise in those over 80 years of age, which will be even more marked than the general ageing of the population. We will go from two per cent of the population over the age of 80 to eight per cent in the next 60 years. It is the case that the older a person becomes the more likely they will require an increasing amount of care and the more likely that they themselves will be disabled.

       I am very proud of Labor's record in tackling the needs of older and disabled Australians. Labor governments in recent years have shown an increased awareness of these needs in three different sorts of ways: firstly, by providing publicly funded services; secondly, by increasing the payment of allowances to carers; and, thirdly and very importantly, by working out changes that enable carers to combine their responsibilities in the paid work force with their responsibilities as carers.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As the motion before us says, one of the most important areas of assistance that is offered to anyone caring for an aged or disabled person is respite care. Many people do not want to give up their caring role even when increasing age makes this more difficult. This is where respite care can bridge the gap and enable people to care for their loved ones in their own homes.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Respite care has been identified by carers as the most important service provided to them. The 1992-93 budget increased the number of days of respite care available in nursing homes and hostels from 28 to 63 per year. The Labor government also encouraged nursing homes to provide additional respite beds through a respite care supplement introduced in 1989.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In a further attempt to ease the shortage of respite beds in nursing homes, the following year's budget announced an allocation of $9.2 million for respite care. It also changed the rules to allow nursing homes to use existing, as opposed to dedicated, beds for respite as they became available. As a consequence, respite admissions to nursing homes have increased steadily and the ratio of respite beds has also increased.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The home and community care program also provides respite care for shorter periods and in emergencies in community centres and at home. Respite care has been one of the fastest growing elements of the home and
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        community care program. In addition to the funding provided jointly by the Commonwealth and the states to carers through the home and community care program, the Labor government in the 1992-93 budget allocated an additional $40 million over four years for respite services.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There is no doubt whatsoever that this funding needs to be continued. Unfortunately, we are yet to get any guarantees from this current government that there will not be cuts to the home and community care program. I urge the member for Murray and all those opposite who do care about this issue to apply as much pressure as possible in the current budget process to make sure that this area of the home and community care program is protected so that carers have the support that they deserve.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Another important reform which Labor instituted was a review of respite care programs. This began in 1995 `to look at the cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of respite care program services delivered through aged and community care programs'—I am now reading the terms of reference—`and to improve the coherence of respite care programs in order to achieve better outcomes for carers and the people they care for'. I am sure we all look forward to receiving that report.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There is no doubt about the seriousness of Labor's commitment to the ongoing welfare of older and disabled Australians. The real question now is: what is this government going to do to continue that commitment? Of particular concern to older Australians, especially those who may be caring for an older or disabled relation at home, is the handing back of aged care services to the states. And, as the member for Murray said, we are yet to hear what will happen to disability services.

       The proposal for aged care is part of what the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) calls competitive federalism.

       It becomes a community issue and one that government must address when you hear and read of elderly parents who are caring for their children saying that they pray that their children will die before they do because they fear for their children's welfare without them to look after them. Whilst not an elderly carer, I understand their concern. I was one of the fortunate ones. When my eldest daughter was aged two, she spent almost four years in hospital with a disability disease that somehow miraculously corrected itself.

       Much has been reported locally, and no doubt nationally, about the many cases of adults with an intellectual disability being left following the death of their carer, predominantly their parents. I have been told by many parents that they are too afraid to die because there is nowhere for their child to go. It is very difficult to expect family members to assume the role of carer when a parent dies, as in most cases they have not had to deal with the day to day care that has been given over many years by the parents. So what happens to these people? Most are removed from their familiar surroundings, usually away from their local area, and placed in some type of care with people unknown to them.

How much then have parents saved governments when these parents have cared for these children over 20, 40 or even 50 years?

That land presents a whole range of development opportunities. There is very considerable private sector interest in housing development on that land. There is the opportunity for expansion of university facilities and also to resolve, by the freeing up of that land, some very longstanding traffic circulation difficulties in the St Albans district.

        The principal problem is the assessment of decontamination works required on the land. The Department of Defence has had for some time a report on that land written by independent consultants. There seems to be some confusion about how that report is to be released to someone like me as the local member. Apparently the Public Works Committee was dealing with this matter in the previous parliament, but it has not yet been reconstituted and there are some questions about whether the documentation needs to go to that committee first. The local community is, frankly, tired of waiting for a resolution of the issues relating to this land and for the opportunities to be taken up.

         —I rise today to commend and congratulate the Australian Chinese and Descendants Mutual Association Inc., particularly their President, Dr Hoc Ku Huynh, and his fine&amp;hyphen;working committee. I do this because in the short 14 years that this organisation has been going as a charitable organisation they have established for themselves a welfare service, they have brought in a Chinese language school, they have built a child&amp;hyphen;care centre and they are now in the process of building an aged persons hostel.

        In relation to the aged persons hostel, we have provided through government something like $1.3 million. They have provided nearly $800,000. This group is possibly in dire need of another $100,000 or $200,000 to complete that building. I know they have raised this matter with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). I would like to commend that application, and I report to the minister for immigration that I support the application from this wonderful group.

        They are a self&amp;hyphen;help group. They did not come to this government to ask for assistance and help when they formed their welfare centre to provide assistance to so many people. They are a group that have seen a need and have taken the initiative. They have certainly worked very hard, both in fundraising and in involving the community at large. I believe that, if other groups were able to achieve what this small group have achieved in such a short time, we would be standing up continually and praising them. Again I say to

         —I want to bring to the attention of the House a devastating fire which occurred just over two weeks ago at Castlemaine in Victoria. Victoria Carpet Mills suffered a loss of equipment and building. The result of that disastrous fire was that 80 people who had formerly been employed at that mill have lost their jobs. I want to compliment officers of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—the CES—and also the state government for their involvement with the Mount Alexander Shire at a meeting following that fire. They have now presented a program of works to try to maintain that 80&amp;hyphen;person work force in the district for the next 12 months.

I have also appealed to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for financial assistance for these workers. Castlemaine, regrettably, has a very high unemployment base anyway, even prior to the fire, with a 20 per cent unemployment rate. It urgently needs financial assistance to help those workers.

         —Two things happened very recently in relation to the Western Australian Liberal Party which shed great illumination on some of the things that have gone on in the last few years. One was a statement on Radio 6PR the other day by Senator Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne that the President of the Liberal Party effectively was his puppet and he was okay as long as Senator Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne had his hand up his back. The second was the revelation yesterday that Wayde Smith, the member for Wanneroo, is intending to recontest preselection for the Liberal Party for the seat of Joondalup.

         Both these things appear to be disconnected, but I brought to the attention of the House last year the fact that Wayde Smith had told me that he had been approached back in 1994 by Senator Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne and told to prevent me getting influence in the Liberal Party branches in the district or he would get a kick in the backside. It appears that relationship is ongoing because we see not only Senator Crichton-Browne retaining a very strong influence in the Western Australian branch but also the reappearance of Wayde Smith, a person who effectively was seen as a disgraced member and who had announced that he was not intending to recontest preselection for the state seat of Joondalup.

The abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head, and then jams scissors into the baby's skull. The scissors are then opened to enlarge the hole. The scissors are removed, a suction tube is inserted and the child's brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The dead baby is then removed.

        I understand that women who are having D&amp;X abortions are being paid the maternity allowance, despite having their babies tortured like this, because their doctor waits until the baby reaches the required gestation age—that is, 20 weeks—to perform the abortion. I have written to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) asking that the maternity allowance not be paid for D&amp;X abortions. I encourage other members to do likewise.

I think it is part and parcel of the role of a political leader not to be deskbound on issues such as this. You do have an obligation to go around the country, particularly to regional and rural areas. This approach of mine will not be limited to the issue of gun control but will apply to other issues of debate and moment and controversy that will arise during the government's time in office.

It will be my intention to do that. I hoped yesterday to transmit to the people who were present at that meeting and to the Australian public the determination of the government to maintain the principles enshrined in the police ministers' decision of some weeks ago which has received such widespread support in the Australian community.

         —Mr Speaker, let me make it entirely clear that, as a result of discussions with the states, the states have agreed to the application of wholesale sales tax in relation to motor vehicles which are used partly or wholly for private use—an exemption which your government never dealt with, an exemption which you were prepared to allow go unchecked. The benefits in relation to this are that the government sector will be on the same footing as the private sector. As a result, when an ordinary citizen buys a car and pays a wholesale sales tax, they can be sure that when a government buys a car as part of a remuneration package that government is on exactly the same footing.

No government could allow the substitution of cars as a reduction of income tax when those cars are being purchased tax free. No government worth its weight could allow it. Yours was a govern ment that allowed it; yours was a government that opened up a huge exemption which ordinary citizens could not benefit from—and this was a government that had the courage to close it, and we have.

Indeed, the Cairns group is one of the most cohesive groups of nations. Notwithstanding some tough working sessions at the conference last week, we were able to get through to an agreed communique and a compact which will help farmers and which will go forward to the WTO negotiations and help bring about, through the mandated negotiations following the Uruguay Round, some further breakthroughs—namely, to deliver a lower level of domestic support around the world, greater market access—

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. The short answer is that it is very important indeed. The $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund will be established to fund five key capital projects aimed at addressing the serious challenges facing this country in the area of environmental and agricultural natural resources. We are very keen to see it go ahead, as I believe all thinking Australians are.

        The program constitutes national capital of vital importance. We propose to spend $700 million to fund five key capital programs over five years, leaving $300 million remaining in perpetuity in the trust. It is also proposed that the trust be funded from the part proceeds arising from the one-third sale of Telstra.

        The fact is that the stakes are very high for groups such as the Australian Democrats. We ought to go back to what Don Chipp said when he set up the party in the first place. Remember those famous words about keeping people honest. Let us put that in context. He uttered those words in response to concerns of the day that the government was not carrying out its pre-election promises. That is why he set his party up. His objective was to get the balance of power to ensure that the government of the day stuck to its election commitments.

        It seems that the Democrats have forgotten all about that and have moved away from that altogether. They are being deliberately obstructionist, using every opportunity to get in the way. If they were in any way fair dinkum about this issue, they would have referred the relevant bill to a legislation committee. But they have not done that. They have referred the bill to a references committee.

        No longer do the Democrats represent the balance of power. It is quite obvious that they are rapidly becoming nothing more than a faction of the ALP. You really have to ask whether their agenda is focused on supporting

        We recognise that Australians regard our coasts as being very special places which play an intrinsic part in our way of life, and indeed are national icons both domestically and overseas. Australians also know that our coasts have increasingly come under threat from human activity. In some ways our coasts have probably been loved to death. Pressures through poor management and development decisions and pollution from our sewerage and river systems have all contributed to coastal degradation. Governments, coastal communities and all Australians understand that we must improve the way we treat our coastlines. We require positive solutions.

        The hypocrisy of Senator Kernot is remarkable. At the end of May in the Senate she called for national leadership in relation to this issue. At the same time that she called on the government to show leadership and protect Australia's coasts and rivers, she is denying the funding for us to be able to do that. The hypocrisy of the situation is thrown into stark relief by the very recent comments made by the head of the Surfrider Foundation.

         —Now he is in favour—that is a good thing. The other good thing is that, according to the report this morning, he is going to move an amendment which would propose and support, apparently, the concept that people's pay should be better. That is a very interesting idea. Members on this side might have actually heard that phrase very recently. In fact, when I flick back over my documents, I find that that was in the title of our policy. After 13 years of essentially opposing real wage increases, Labor are suddenly going to propose an amendment to our package so that people will have better pay. You do not have to move any amendments to our package to get better pay. All you have got to do is vote for our package.

        It is also true, apparently, that they want to move amendments which will encourage and facilitate the development and registration of organisations.

That will encourage more unions which are more relevant to the workers that they represent.

        Lastly, I would have to say that the most ludicrous amendment which has apparently been the subject of drafting by the shadow minister and his advisers is that provisions of the bill are to be tested against ILO conventions. I invite people to contrast their position

         on this. The opposition have been screeching with indignation at the thought that state agreements might override federal awards, but they are now proposing an amendment whereby international ILO conventions will override Australian law.

You had better work out what your lines are in this, because on the one hand you say it is a so&amp;hyphen;called deficit and on the other hand every state in the Commonwealth comes here—including Bob Carr—and accepts a reduction to fill a non&amp;hyphen;existent hole.

The one principle on which all the Premiers were agreed was that the shambles that we had been left required a contribution from the states. They preferred to make their contribution in this way. They are making their contribution; the Commonwealth government will make its contribution. The only people who did not make any contribution were you.

         —I have been in this House for 11 years and the only time I have ever heard from that man is with his points of order. It is incredible. It is the only time. The fact is that if we did not abolish this program we would otherwise have to reduce spending on humanitarian programs within the aid budget: cutting out programs to assist with HIV&amp;hyphen;AIDS in Africa; cutting out humanitarian programs in countries like Bangladesh. We were not prepared to do that. If we had to make a reduction in the aid budget, we were prepared to do that in the area of business subsidies.

         Let it be said that, in light of the DIFF program, Transfield—which is a good company but is one of the richest companies in this country—has received $153.4 million in subsidies from the Australian government. For one of the richest companies in this country to get $153.4 million in subsidies from taxpayers I do not believe is good use of the aid budget. I happen to think that is not a good idea.

         I acknowledge the comments that Mr Woolcott made as referred to in the question. Mr Woolcott is a very fine Australian, but he is a consultant to Transfield. The fact is that he does have a view to promote in the interests of this company. He does not hide that from me.

         The simple fact is that the Labor Party argued before the last election that there should be a $1 billion increase in spending on the aid budget but never explained where the money was coming from. We know what you were always planing to do—and that was to increase taxes. That is what you were planning to do. That was why the member for Gellibrand would never rule out increases in taxes.

         Do not think that is a digression because that is their real agenda. That is what they are about. You can bet your bottom dollar that the Labor Party—which reduced the aid budget throughout the life of its government over 13 years—in opposition is going to be talking about increasing the aid budget. That is what they will doing; that is the expediency of it. The subliminal message is that these people are about tax increases to fix this country's fiscal problems. It is as simple as that.

         —Honourable members may recall that just after the election the Maritime Union of Australia announced that a deal had been struck with one of Australia's largest stevedores, Conaust—or CTAL as they are more commonly known—that would deliver for the Australian waterfront what had not been delivered for years and years, and that is an efficient, competitive and reliable Australian waterfront. That deal is now known as the PEP scheme.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We were told that the PEP scheme would deliver productivity improvements and lower costs to the stevedoring company and, therefore, to its users. This sounded great. Those of us who had been following the waterfront for a long time had come to expect a lot of promise on the waterfront but not much delivery. This sounded new, it sounded different and it sounded encouraging. The joint Chief Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Mr John Coombs, promised us that this would bring home the bacon for Australia; this would deliver the goods. We would have an efficient waterfront for Australia and for those people desperately seeking a competitive economy and, therefore, a job.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What has actually happened? The scheme, rather prophetically, came into action on 1 April of this year. I say `rather prophetically' because that was April Fool's Day. What has been the result? Prior to the scheme coming into place average crane movements per hour at Conaust were 17. What is the figure today?
        <break page="1958" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Two and a half months after the scheme came into effect crane rates have fallen to 14.4 per hour in Sydney, for example. So, rather than crane rates and productivity going up, they have started to decline.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is the truth about the lower costs we were promised by the scheme? Part of the deal was that overtime rates would be written into the normal base salary for those people working at Conaust on the Australian waterfront. This would therefore lift their pay to a much higher base. Members need to know that average earnings are about $80,000 a year. What was the outcome of this? Have labour costs gone down on the Australian waterfront? The answer is no. Conaust has experienced an increase in labour costs to its business of $100,000 a week on average since the scheme came into effect. So after 2&amp;half; months of this great promise, rather than productivity going up, it has gone down and, rather than labour costs going down, they have gone up. This continues the performance that we came to expect under the previous Labor government, where we saw years of talk and very little action—action that unfortunately involved the expenditure of some $450 million to provide incentive for the waterfront workers to work more efficiently and reliably.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This example shows us that we cannot rely on the Maritime Union of Australia to deliver on its promises. The only way Australians can expect to get a waterfront that is efficient and reliable and internationally competitive is to see the industrial relations legislation that was introduced by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations in this House pass through this parliament. If that is the case, then we will end up with an efficient, competitive and reliable Australian waterfront.

         —Mr Speaker, I refer you to events at the conclusion of question time on the last sitting day, which was 30 May, from memory, and in particular to statements which I, the member for Werriwa and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had to withdraw. I seek your clarification as to the circumstances in which members are required to withdraw statements made in this place.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In particular, I draw your attention to the fact that the request to withdraw occurred some 20 to 30 minutes after the statements were made; secondly, they were made across the chamber and not in debate; and, thirdly, to the extent that they had any reflection on any person, it was not on members of this chamber.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I ask you: firstly, in what circumstances can a member be asked to withdraw a statement other than immediately after the statement has been made; secondly, is there any distinction between statements made in debate and statements made across the chamber; and, thirdly, in what circumstances can a member be asked to withdraw a statement that carries no reflection on a current member of this House?

        The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the plight of young Australian adults suffering from multiple sclerosis. At present Betaferon, the only drug available to the improve the quality of life for these citizens and potentially decrease the percentage of these people that will inevitably become a disabled burden on society and the government, is not available as a subsidised drug. Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate to make Betaferon available as a subsidised drug for all Australians that may benefit from it.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Disability's unmet needs campaign, and Unicare. There are thousands of Australians with disabilities, together with their families and carers, who are living in the community without adequate, if any, support services. People with disabilities and their families are in crisis. Service providers are unable to respond to, and governments are not addressing, this strategic issue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It must be realised that caring for a disabled young child is a very different experience from caring for a disabled adult. There is a great diversity in people's caring experiences and much variance in carers' needs. Different issues or concerns will be paramount at particular stages of both the carer's and disabled person's life.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The day-to-day care of a severely disabled person is difficult and stressful because it is unrelenting. Pressures of meeting the needs, expectations and demands of other family members as well as of the disabled person impact upon issues such as privacy, space, employment and financial stability. Furthermore, continuous care drains the carer emotionally and physically and can create social isolation, depression and ill health.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A growing problem facing Australia is the number of ageing parents. Many have been caring for their son or daughter for 40 or more years with no hope of any change to their lifestyle. Many older people with carer responsibilities are extremely anxious about what will happen to their son or daughter when they die. It is essential that governments help provide quality supported residential options for disabled people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The burden of care on older carers should be relieved. As one elderly carer put it, `My son has the intellectual capacity of a child. However, by law, he is considered an adult. What happens when I die? Will he just fall through the net, becoming a pawn in a system that does not address the issue of compassionate care?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Respite can be a means of conditioning young disabled people, particularly from the age of 30 onwards, against the trauma suffered on the death of a lifelong carer. It must be remembered that the carer may be the only constant human contact that that disabled
        <break page="1965" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         person has ever had. However, often there is a reluctance on behalf of the carers to use the respite because of the limited availability and the limited awareness of the quality of care, the difficulties in recruiting and maintaining the care providers, the financial concerns, the bureaucratic obstacles, transportation and a reluctance to leave family members with a stranger.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Carers must be educated and given the opportunity and access to respite care, including crisis care. Out of the diverse range of formal support needed by carers, this is probably the most critical. Carers want and need respite as a regular ongoing alternative so that they have an opportunity to have a decent quality of life. Respite care must be made available to meet the specific needs of people with care needs at different times in their lives. It must be a flexible system available when carers need it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In order to provide this respite care, financial resources must be made available. I am personally aware of one case where an 80-year-old carer has had to have surgery and has been given a grant from a crisis fund to provide one week's care for her disabled son. There is no provision for any possible ongoing need for either her or her son. The expectation is that even at 80 she will recover and be able to carry on as usual after a week's respite. I hope for her son's sake that she is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Carers need access to service delivery that takes into account the needs of the family unit. The ideal situation would be for consumer focused funding directed to the family to enable them to purchase the service that they need. Appropriateness is the key to helping carers. I call upon the negotiators who will meet to review the three-year Commonwealth-state disability agreement to give particular attention to these needs. I thank the House.

        It is now the appropriate time for the Howard government to give a commitment for additional funds to be made available for the care of handicapped people. I support the remarks of the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), when she speaks of the programs of the previous Labor government and outlines what needs to be done in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In speaking on this private member's motion, I would like to refer to the work of a small group of people within the electorate of Greenway who are providing limited daytime care for between eight and 12 handicapped people. This group is called the Yakatoon Post-School Options and is for handicapped adult people over 18 years of age. The program is for handicapped people who left school after 1993 and is funded by the New South Wales Department of Community Services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the many handicapped people who left school before 1993, they have to remain institutionalised or be cared for on a full-time basis at home because there is no funding for a similar program for these people. The group I am speaking about is providing daytime care for some people from the Marsden Home at Parramatta. If more funds were available this program would be able to be expanded to provide daytime care for adults who are presently being looked after at home by parents or who still remain in institutions full time.
       </para>

        Yakatoon Post-School Options ensures that handicapped people under this program get their medication on time and are trained in living skills that may eventually enable them to move to group homes. In speaking to people involved in this program you hear of horrific cases where handicapped people are not receiving proper care at home—such as a 15-year-old handicapped boy with no living skills whatsoever being locked up with dogs in a shed in a backyard.

         When people such as this come to Yakatoon they require additional assistance because of the lack of previous care, and their progress is generally slow. But you are also advised of noticeable improvement in people when they receive adequate medical attention and training in living skills. This improvement makes the program worth while. There are two full-time staff and two part-time staff employed on this post-school options program. Because of the poor living skills of clients, some need extensive assistance requiring two or more staff to assist with meals and toilet functions. The hours that each client can spend on this program are therefore restricted because of the lack of finance and staff.

         One way of relieving the burden on parents is for people with disabilities to obtain useful employment wherever possible. There are two excellent organisations operating in western Sydney that are involved in finding work opportunities for people with disabilities. I refer to Job Match, an arm of the Northcote society, and METS, the Macquarie Employment Training Service. These two organisations are very worried that Commonwealth funding for their programs will be cut. The end result of such funding cuts would be to push handicapped people back into institutions full time, back into home care and back into full pensions, reducing the employment and living skills education of handicapped people.

         I thank the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for raising this very important motion. It covers an area where there is certainly a lack of concern in the community for handicapped people in particular and certainly for people who are looking after these handicapped people. Therefore, I am very happy to support the motion. I join with other speakers in urging governments involved in negotiating the three-year Commonwealth-state disability agreement to ensure that adequate funds are available for the caring of handicapped people.

        The second thing I noticed is how fortunate we in Australia are to have a range of support services available to us. Most Australians can normally get by but, when sickness strikes the home or someone has an incapacity or a disability, those affected find they are struggling against the stream. It is a very difficult situation to be in, and we all know people in that situation.

        In my travels throughout the Riverina I often come into contact with people who I believe deserve our greatest admiration, respect and, above all, help. These people are the carers of the sick, the aged and the disabled. Throughout the Riverina and Australia what has been described as an `invisible army' is at work. Although they include some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in our society, they contribute to our communities about $8 billion which would otherwise have to be funded by governments—and we all know governments cannot do that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates there are 1.5 million carers in Australia—or one in every five households. That is a staggering figure. Of these carers, many are providing care for 35 hours a week or more. Caring, as we all know, can be hard work, considering that some carers are no longer young and mobile. They have to feed, bathe, dress, toilet, drive, medicate, supervise, comfort and nurse some of the most vulnerable people in our community.

        Recently we had National Carers Week. During that week, the role of carers was brought to our attention. I am sure that most members in this House would be aware of that role but some may not be. I personally know, as would most members know, of
        <break page="1967" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         parents who have chronically ill children. They take it in turns to sleep because their child has to be turned regularly throughout the night. Many carers have to get the people they are caring for out of bed and to the toilet or into the shower and so on. It takes a great deal of work and effort. As carers become older, it becomes even more difficult for them. I am sure most of my colleagues, as I said before, would know of similar unfortunate situations.

        To a carer, the things that most of us take for granted as everyday pleasures can be a luxury. Many carers would dearly love to have just one night of unbroken sleep or an occasional day off, even though they love the person they are caring for in an indescribable manner—if they did not they would not be caring for them in the way they do. They would be very grateful for just a few hours off to see a movie or even spend time in the garden to smell the roses. These people experience social isolation, poor emotional wellbeing, lower life satisfaction and feelings of depression and anxiety—all of which can lead to stress&amp;hyphen;related illnesses.

        We should all welcome any initiative which recognises the wonderful contribution made to society by all categories of carers but more particularly by the growing number of aged carers, who deserve special consideration in enabling them to access respite from their demanding tasks and to be supported by permanent residential or in-house care services for their dependants. Anything that can be done in this way to assist these people by either federal or state governments will, I am sure, not only support carers but support the whole community and those people who are being cared for. We can imagine the thoughts running through the minds of people being cared for and their love for those caring for them. I once again commend the member for Murray for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.

        The unique thing about this motion is that it is not so much a chance to speak about the role of carers per se, which I will always be happy to do—I will always be honoured to refer to the work that people in our community take on when they adopt the role of carer—but a chance to speak about something additional: the people in the community who have in their families and under their care and control at the moment ageing children—children who are reaching an older age than ever before have we seen. Parents fear for them in terms of their future accommodation, their future care and their future security.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is different to the general role of caring, which I am not in any sense demeaning. We really must look at this additional layer of concern. The medical advances that have been made in our society and our community mean that, joyously, we are living longer and those people afflicted by a disability of some kind are also now living longer. Not that long ago a child born with, for instance, Down syndrome had a far shorter life expectancy. It is now not at all uncommon to see adults with Down syndrome living into their 30s, 40s, 50s and even early 60s.

        A lot of these people—I am using them as an example but we are talking about many other people in our community as well—are generally in the care of their parents. When one parent dies, the remaining parent, generally a female—I say this purely because of statistics—continues to care for their child, who may be well into adulthood. The concern that these carers have and that which I think the member for Murray is reflecting in her motion relates to what governments in this country are doing and what the community at large is doing to address the concerns of these carers, who are worried about the future accommodation and security needs of their children.

         The shadow minister earlier in this debate mentioned a group of community organisations who late last week outlined their concern at that very possibility of devolution of the programs to the states and territories. I also refer to that, and refer very quickly to the types of organisations that are included in the statement outlining those concerns. They include the Australian Council of Social Service, the National Industry Association for Disability Services, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and many others. There are many community organisations who share the level of concern I have. Many in this place share that concern as well. I implore this government and all governments in this country to think very seriously and very constructively about what options can be available for those people.

        Several months ago, 680 workers in south&amp;hyphen;western Sydney, most of whom live within my electorate, suddenly found themselves out of a job. Through no fault of their own, the company for which they worked, Exicom Pty Ltd, had collapsed into receivership and subsequent liquidation, with irrecoverable debts totalling almost $50 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The workers themselves—jobless, full of apprehension and anxiety—had more than the cross of unexpected unemployment to bear. When Exicom shut its doors, it owed its employees a total of $17 million—$6 million in annual and long service leave entitlements and $11 million in redundancy payments. The redundancy payments expected by the staff were unusually high because most of Exicom's workers had been with the company, and prior to it being taken over by Exicom when it was the telecommunications business AWA, for over 10 years and many up to 20 years.

         Exicom's journey towards insolvency was characterised by shoddy management and irresponsible financial deals. As far back as October 1994, Exicom was described by its own chairman, Barry Capp, in an address to the annual shareholder's meeting, as a `nightmare'. It seems that, by March 1996, little had changed; only now Mr Capp's nightmare vision had become a reality for those 680 ordinary workers.

         The story I have just relayed is not unusual. It is noteworthy for the scale on which hundreds of Sydneysiders have suddenly found themselves out of a job, but company insolvencies in Australia are neither unusual nor surprising. Sadly, they are an everyday occurrence around the country. In the 10 months prior to April this year, there were 6,892 company insolvencies. In the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 financial year, there were 7,240 insolvencies.

         Business collapse, for whatever reason, is an unfortunate reality of commercial life the world over. While governments of all political persuasions will continue to strive to create a climate where private companies are less likely to meet such unhappy ends, company failure is accepted, albeit regrettably, as a price worth paying for the privilege of operating in our chosen economic framework.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the financial hardship shouldered by the thousands of Australian workers who lose their jobs every year as a result of insolvency need not be accepted with the same grim resignation. Once we can see, through the example of other countries, that it is unnecessary to subject workers to the unfortunate spin&amp;hyphen;offs associated with company insolvency, I believe it would be irresponsible for us, as the elected representatives of the people who endure these hardships, not to do something about it.

         Wage earner protection funds have operated in Western Europe since the late 1960s as a means of protecting workers from company insolvency. The fact that funds now operate in countries and provinces far removed from the traditionally welfare&amp;hyphen;oriented economies of Europe—for example, in Japan—I think speaks volumes for the benefits associated with such schemes.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          A wage earner protection fund can be described simply as an `insurance scheme'. Compulsory contributions are made to protect workers and to guarantee the obligations of their employees in respect of unpaid leave and redundancy payments, should the company for which they work be forced into insolvency. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its general insolvency inquiry of 1988—otherwise known as the Harmer report—described such funds as operating on a basis similar to Medicare. In most cases, the compulsory contributions are made by the employers alone—a recognition that the risk of insolvency lies entirely with the employers themselves.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, there are notable exceptions to this rule. In the Netherlands and Switzerland, for example, the financial burden is shared equally by both employers and workers. As with Medicare, the scheme is based on the underlying principle of mandatory participation. There is no differentiation made between companies which are `good risks' or `bad risks'. As a result, the coverage of the schemes is extensive, with the majority of a nation's workers receiving protection.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As is the practice in the majority of other countries, governments are exempt from participating in the funds. The most common dividing line separating those included and those excluded from making fund contributions is drawn between employers which are liable to liquidation procedures and those which are not, like the government, being excluded.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact that wager earner protection funds are based on such solid and non&amp;hyphen;negotiable underlying principles, such as mandatory participation, should not draw members into believing that there is no variation between funds. A wage earner protection scheme in Australia need not merely be introduced as a pale imitation of a European fund. There is enormous scope for a wage earner fund to be introduced into Australia which suits the economic terrain of our society and which meets the expectations of both employers and employees alike.

          <break page="1970" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           wage earner protection funds, and I would encourage members interested to look into the wide range of proposals made. The majority of funds already in operation guarantee workers' claims in respect of wages and severance pay, although other categories of claims are also covered, depending on the responsibilities of the social security system in that country, or the maturity or presence of enterprise agreements, which also differ from country to country.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In no country does a wage earner protection fund guarantee, without limitation, the entirety of the worker's claims. The returns from such schemes are specified at a set maximum, a figure which also varies between countries. The benefits associated with such funds are obvious. While no amount of social security can guarantee workers will not lose their job when insolvency strikes, at least under such a scheme we can guarantee workers their wages and termination payments should it come to the worst for their company.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Further, workers are guaranteed prompt payment. There is no time spent waiting for the sale of the company's assets or deciding on the priority of payment of creditors over workers. The amount of litigation surrounding the insolvency is also reduced. Workers and workers' representative groups no longer need to seek recourse to the law in order to obtain moneys owed to them. Emergency social security payments—government money—is no longer required to support workers and their families when a business collapses unexpectedly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But the real value of these funds is that they protect the worker's future. We have recently heard the Treasurer (Mr Costello) talking in this House about `intergenerational, financial impropriety' in relation to protecting the future finances of Australians. If he is concerned, as he says he is, and if the government is really worried about the financial future of ordinary Australian workers, it would give serious consideration to introducing a wage earner protection scheme into Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As our international partners and allies have already shown, Australian workers need never—due to the insolvency of the company

           for which they have worked—be left in arrears of wages or other entitlements. It is no longer enough that we give our sympathy to workers made redundant from companies such as Exicom in my electorate. These workers deserve more than our sympathy; they deserve our practical and sensible support. I believe that is what the wage earner protection funds offer.

          We cannot put an end to business failure, to company collapse, but we can do something more to safeguard the rights of ordinary Australian workers, the ones who are always the first to suffer from management incompetence or when an unexpected disaster strikes a company during a downturn in the economy. It is, I believe, nothing less than our duty to support this motion before the House.

With the usual dispassionate bluntness of many legal documents, the accompanying material revealed that I should forget about ever receiving any payment for the work which I had undertaken. The solicitor's debts ran to several million dollars; his assets ran to very little. After so many years of non&amp;hyphen;payment, I wondered whether I would ever be paid. However, the receipt of the bankruptcy details remains somewhat galling as the solicitor was expected to hold in trust fees for payment. I do not know whether these fees had ever been collected from the clients but, certainly, a failure to preserve them and pay them as appropriate, whether to me or to other people by whom services had been performed, would involve a fundamental breach of trust.

        The problem can be simply stated: when a company becomes insolvent, unsecured creditors and employees of that company stand to lose payments which are rightfully due to them. The honourable member's motion proposes a means of protecting employees in that situation by the creation of an employment wage protection fund. The purpose of such a fund would be to provide compensation to employees for outstanding payments owed to them, such as wages, accrued annual leave, long service leave and severance pay.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        One would hardly say that $14,550 is an exorbitant sum to expect to receive upon termination after 20 years service. Yet it is commonplace for employees of insolvent companies to walk away with absolutely nothing, or with paltry amounts like 25 cents in the dollar. Given this situation, one must seriously ask "who really does bear the financial risk in insolvency situations?"
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two approaches to the problem. One is to introduce an employee wage protection fund, as envisaged by the honourable member's motion. The other, which has been adopted in this country to date, is to provide under the bankruptcy and insolvency laws a privilege for payments to employees. These two approaches are provided for in convention 173 of the International Labour Organisation. Article three of the convention allows a member country the choice of a guarantee, such as a wage earner protection scheme, or a privilege in insolvency proceedings.

        Section 556 of the Corporations Law establishes the priority of debts and claims of unsecured creditors in the event of the winding up of a company. Although there are a number of items listed before employee wages and superannuation, injury compensation payments and retrenchment payments, these

        The situation for employees was improved with the passage of the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Act 1993. Under this legislation, the former priority of the Commissioner of Taxation for the recovery of moneys owed to the commissioner by companies which became insolvent or were liquidated was removed. The main beneficiaries of that piece of legislation were employees of such companies. The complaint made about the current arrangement is that employees are still treated like unsecured creditors and, in many cases, receive little, if anything, where a company is insolvent. Further, it is argued that a legal remedy, even against a director personally, is a problematic exercise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was considered by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1988 report of the general insolvency inquiry. The commission asked whether the rationale for continuing the priority for employees was still relevant—and I quote:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principal rationale for the employee priority has been significantly diminished by the development of a sophisticated social welfare system. Further, the effect of the priority is to deprive other unsecured creditors of their claim to a share of the available assets. Included in that class of unsecured creditors may be small traders who are substantially dependent upon the insolvent for their business and persons who were in an employee&amp;hyphen;like relationship with the insolvent but who are classified (in a strict legal sense) as independent contractors. These creditors may be as vulnerable as employees in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation but enjoy no protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        These considerations are important. With the ongoing change to the labour markets in Australia, many people who in earlier times were employees are now independent contractors, as individuals, in partnerships or incorporated small businesses. The current priority for employees does not extend to them. Nevertheless, the commission found strong support for the continuation of the priority payment system for employees.

        The report went on to propose that the government give consideration to the creation of an employee wage protection scheme. It was said by the commission that such a
        <break page="1972" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         scheme would, first, guarantee payment; secondly, ensure prompt payment; and, thirdly, reduce litigation over priorities. I note that accord mark 8, proposed for 1995&amp;hyphen;99 by the previous government, included an examination of an employee wage protection scheme. Despite this endorsement, there are a number of issues which I believe require further consideration.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        First, there would be considerable cost involved in collecting contributions and administering the fund. Secondly, such a fund imposes another cost on the overwhelming majority of well&amp;hyphen;managed companies which meet their obligations to employees. In most countries with a wage earner protection fund, compulsory contributions are made by the employer—and I note that the honourable member for Prospect gave the instance of two countries at least where employees make contributions as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Thirdly, such a fund may not reduce litigation, as an element of such a scheme would include a provision to allow the fund to pursue directors for debts subrogated to the fund. Overseas experience suggests that recovery rates are, at the very best, poor. I note that one article suggested that the best recovery rates obtained under the fund against insolvent companies was about one-third.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, suggestions have been made, for example, by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Accountants to the Law Reform Commission inquiry, that a fund be run as a social service by the government. Given the existence of unemployment and other social security benefits, many would question the imposition on the taxpayer of further costs in this manner.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are, however, some reasons for examining the scheme in more detail. First, the cost of insolvency extends throughout the community. Where companies fail to make their payments to employees, it is usually the case that they fail to pay other creditors as well. These creditors are usually other tradespersons. Secondly, such a scheme may address the blight of the so-called `phoenix company'—the phoenix being that creature in Greek mythology that rises from its own
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         ashes. These companies are notorious in the building industry. The company with the head contract becomes insolvent. Subsequently, the same directors are found conducting another company with a similar name and enjoying the same lifestyle, and in the meantime subcontractors are without payment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Two suggestions have been made recently for addressing this issue. The Victorian parliament's Law Reform Committee in its report
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Curbing the phoenix company
        </emphasis>
        made a series of recommendations in relation to the establishment of an assetless company fund which would provide a basis for the funding of legal challenges in these circumstances. I note, secondly, that the Public Works Committee of this parliament has, in fact, insisted that in contracts, particularly head contracts, provision be made so that other contractors down the line are protected in these circumstances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I welcome the discussion that has been initiated by the honourable member for Prospect. I believe that measures to preclude persons from abusing the corporate structure, in particular the phoenix company situation, are measures which need careful consideration and attention by the parliament.

        It is for that reason that in my very first speech in this parliament I suggested that one of the biggest issues now and in the future for Australians is security in life. Importantly, at the heart of this question is security at work. Unfortunately, as we all know, in recent decades the old security that most people used to have with their work and their futures has been drastically eroded.

I also refer in passing to the orgy of company takeovers in the 1980s which added to people's job uncertainties and feelings of insecurity, in the same way as the current government's attack on the Public Service is doing across Australia—just as has, more recently, the destructive fad of downsizing among senior management under which a measure of the size of one's salary package is related to how successful you are in sacking workers.

         For this reason, Australians are now demanding that politicians address their growing uncertainties in life—and we on the Labor side are determined to do so.

There are also often delays in

         I also know that, more often than not, such hardship unfortunately falls on the lowest paid and less industrially strong in the community, because they all too often work in the industries confronted by structural change which results in many companies going under. On that note, I suggest it is crystal clear from previous investigations in Australia and from the experience of other countries that wage earner protection funds are economically viable and socially necessary in a civilised modern nation. We need a parliamentary inquiry now, not later, to ensure that we properly investigate this constructive proposal. We need it in order to push the policy debate along and to give Australians a greater sense of security and hope for the future in one of the most important areas of their lives: namely, their work and their security with respect to the capacity to look after their families.

So I have a fair bit of passion about this issue. My own approach to it, frankly, is to ask that more lateral thinking be applied to this problem. For example, the Commonwealth now, to its credit, requires the head contractor to certify and to produce evidence that subcontractors have been paid before progress payments are made on construction jobs. I fought for years to get that in the state. I am very happy to see that the Commonwealth has done that. That is the sort of lateral thinking we can adopt.

        I think it would not take much ingenuity to devise a scheme whereby companies are encouraged and even rewarded under a code of ethics or accreditation systems to introduce practices where they put into trust accounts that are legally shielded from liquidation the accumulated sums that a good company under good management should put aside each month towards long service and annual leave. Then the legal problems would be solved.

That is our responsibility.

I was not going to do that, but the honourable member for Batman, in what should have been a non-party political contribution, attempted once again to put the class war.

Unless we encourage them to do that, we will not achieve our full potential and, even worse, our young people in Australia will be denied employment opportunities. We must understand that there is a change in Australia, and the honourable member for Batman should take that into account.

That sort of arrangement could readily be accommodated without incurring the costs which were the concerns of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews).

Indeed, any legal proceedings to do so are automatically stayed as a result of winding&amp;hyphen;up proceedings being commenced.

Labor's most recent reforms to corporate law in 1993 saw redundant employees placed ahead of the Tax Office in order of priority when a company went into liquidation. This issue was raised then, if the member for Prospect had been listening.

        The coalition certainly agreed with the prime objective of the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In his second reading speech on that bill, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) described it as `laudable', but warned:

        In some countries, these schemes are administered as a state welfare fund—definitely a big ticket item for the government of the day—whilst in others they are merely insurance schemes. In many participating countries these are funded solely by employers, or, in a few cases, both employers and employees share the burden. Either way, it was obviously a system placed decisively in Labor's too&amp;hyphen;hard basket during its term in office, despite being canvassed by the Law Reform Commission in 1988 in its general insolvency inquiry.

        In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the inquiry, the commission sought views on the establishment of a wage earner protection fund to which all employers and employees would contribute, which would have its contributions collected with the payment of tax—such as the Medicare levy—and which would allocate the administration of payouts to the liquidator. Needless to add, the commission received many submissions supporting a wage earner protection fund, although most supporters did not accept that employees should have to make any contribution.

        Despite Professor Harmer's recommendation for a protection fund to be considered, Labor took the soft option of simply beefing up the employee priority in the hierarchy of claims—a sort of safety net with holes—to allow the claims of employees as creditors to jump the queue ahead of the Taxation Office but still behind those associated with the winding up of the company.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In his report, Professor Harmer questioned the relevance of the rationale of the priority system. He noted that the priority was first introduced into insolvency legislation for social welfare reasons but that the `effect of the priority is to deprive other unsecured creditors of their claim to a share of the available assets'. He went on to note—and rightly so—that the unsecured creditors may include `small traders who were substantially dependent upon the insolvent for their business'.

         In 1994, Labor had an opportunity to ratify the International Labour Organisation convention concerning the security of employee entitlements upon insolvency in one of two ways: either by a privilege in the ranking of claims or protection by a guarantee institution or fund. When the Keating government ratified the convention, it only accepted the former. Of course, that was not surprising, given the economic circumstances at the time. The perceived cost impact would have been political suicide in that period of skyrocketing cost burdens on the business sector.

         The Australian business sector was buckling under an avalanche of government imposed impediments, such as the increasing employer contributions to employee superannuation.

To the best of my judgment, 90 per cent were in excess of 50 years old and 95 per cent were in excess of 40 years old. The concern in this area seems to be primarily an elderly male one—and make of that what you will. If I may deal with some of the objections, they say that these proposals `brand innocent people as criminals'. I think this was best answered by Associate Professor Simon Chapman, who, in the

        That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.

        Leaving out the offensive fact that this rules out Catholics, Jews, Muslims and everybody else having the right to own arms, it seems to me that, even if we conceded the fact that the Bill of Rights can be amended from time to time according to the conditions of the country, it perfectly fits the Bill of Rights. It says that you may hold arms `suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law'. That is all we are doing. We are certainly not banning all firearms.

That is absolute, ridiculous nonsense. Indeed, if they cared to read what is being put out, some of it is quite reasonable indeed. I am pleased to say that I am now receiving letters from the farming community around my electorate in particular saying, `Hang in there. We support what is being proposed.

        One of the points being made by the gun control opponents is that the broad mass of Australia has been overwhelmed by emotion and there has been no logical thinking on this matter. The reality is that what Australians say now is what they have consistently said over the past few decades. In September 1995, 93 per cent of Australians supported a gun register. In  1978, 78 per cent of Tasmanians supported gun licensing. A New South Wales Department of Health survey earlier this year indicated that 92 per cent of the urban population and 80 per cent of rural residents supported compulsory annual registration of weapons.

        In August 1991, the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald

        published a poll that indicated that 90 per cent of those surveyed would support the banning of semiautomatics and 67 per cent believed that only those people who absolutely need them for their employment should have guns. So there is a long, sustained support in the Australian electorate for restrictive gun laws.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am afraid to say that, if we fail this time, the situation will only deteriorate further. There are some very important statistics from the United States in regard to a distinction between gun owners and the mass of the population in what they think about this issue. A United States report of 15 August 1994 polled people according to various categories—males, females. The poll indicated that only 42 per cent of the people who owned guns supported gun licensing whereas those who did not own guns had a 58 per cent support for licensing.

         very strong, sustained vested interest in the proliferation of guns. The average person is essentially against gun ownership, wants licensing and wants restrictions. As I say, as more and more people have this vested interest, the situation deteriorates.

        One of the great furphies exposed over a decade ago by people like Frank Zimring is the concept that if you have a gun in your home you will be able to use it against an assailant or against burglars.

         New England Journal of Medicine

        of Seattle homicides over a six&amp;hyphen;year period concluded that, for every case of self&amp;hyphen;protection homicide involving a firearm kept in the home, there were 1.3 accidental deaths, 4.6 criminal homicides and 37 suicides involving firearms—an overall ratio of 43 to one. In other words, for every time that a burglar might have been shot by a person half asleep in bed, if they actually managed to get hold of a gun, 43 people were suicide victims or accidentally shot—10&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old kids shot by their seven&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old brother, for instance.

        It is also worth indicating from Kellerman's work, which has been verified by a number of private corporation surveys of Canadian gun laws, that one of the great comparisons in this respect is that between Canada and the United States. As an island continent, Australia does not have a lot of similarities with the United States, but Canada shares a mainland border with the United States and has a lot of similar patterns. Yet there is a very clear differentiation between gun homicides in Canada and in the United States.

        Kellerman indicated in 1988 after a seven&amp;hyphen;year study of Vancouver and Seattle that there were similar crime levels in all offences, bar those involving guns. In that situation there was a 4.8 to one—nearly five to one—difference in regard to the risk of being murdered with a hand gun. It is clear from the evidence from Canada, which has opted for restrictive gun laws and has strengthened them on a number of occasions—mostly recently in the last year or so and, earlier, in

        It is important to bear in mind that the vast majority of people in Australia who possess firearms are perfectly reasonable, sensible, law-abiding citizens. They own firearms because they have been trained in their use, probably by their fathers or mothers before them, and they have used them on their farms or to hunt in ways which they regard as part of their entitlement as citizens of this country. Certainly none of them would regard themselves in any way as responsible in whole or in part for incidents of the kind that sponsored our resolve as a nation to take action after the Port Arthur matter.

         —I want to make a few comments today because it is important that, while we have been addressing the question of gun control for some time and its significance in reducing the level of violence in our community, certainly the capacity for the mass killings that we have seen not only in Tasmania, very sadly, but also on other occasions in Victoria and in New South Wales, to give recent examples, we do not ignore the wider question of community violence and we do not restrict our objections and investigations to matters that are perhaps popular in the public imagination, including the treatment of violence on television. I would certainly urge the government that in looking at the question of community violence it look very closely at its own programs—programs that have been developed partly in response to the last committee that was established to examine violence, the National Committee on Violence. Its recommendations, some 138 of them made in 1990, provide the basis for a very substantial set of solutions to community violence.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A number of programs are in jeopardy right now. That is the warning I want to issue. The Office of the Status of Women has had carriage of substantial education programs that deal with the question not just of domestic violence—although principally that—but also violence in the community directed towards women, which is endemic in our community, sadly. The Office of the Status of Women have already been told that they will have some 46 per cent of their staff, of their programs, cut. They have been told, as I
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         understand it, that there is to be no program delivery. That would include the whole of that substantial program directed at changing attitudes towards violence against women.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have seen considerable success in that agenda already, beginning in 1987, when we found some attitudes towards violence against women that certainly deserved to be condemned and repudiated. We have made substantial progress in conjunction with the states through national leadership and a national campaign to at least get members of the community to recognise that violence against women, whether in the domestic circumstance or elsewhere, is simply not acceptable. To have that program put under threat, as it appears to be, and certainly without leadership, is of growing concern to me and to many other groups in the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I notice that the coalition through its minister responsible committed itself to a national summit on domestic violence to be held later this year. That was something that it promised in the election campaign. How it relates to these broader questions of ongoing programs is not clear. Senator Newman, who is responsible, suggested to a meeting of women's organisations last week that the Office of the Status of Women would organise it, that it would be a summit of 100 experts and that it would be small and focused rather than a talkfest. That is all very well, but having a steering committee of public servants is hardly representative of the wider community.

        At this stage I would have to say that I think the focus is wrong and the process is wrong. Why, for instance, limit it to domestic violence? It should be broader, so that issues concerning sexual assault and violence against women generally that occur outside the home can also be discussed. The focus of this summit is no doubt wrong because the process of setting it up is wrong, not least because the minister has already excluded a number of non-government organisations from the steering committee. For instance, the Women's Emergency Services Network is not included on the steering committee. I would like to know whether the minister believes
        <break page="1981" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that an organisation that supports on a daily basis some 12,000 women and children would have nothing to contribute to the organisation of such a summit. I would have thought they were critical. She says she wants a summit of experts. I would have to say again that the view that these people who deliver services on a daily basis are not expert is insulting.

       <para first-indent="16">
        A whole range of programs is at risk at the moment, including women's health programs, family planning funding, and accommodation. These are all critical areas that support women and their families, who are the subject already of violence in the home and who are at risk. We have already initiated a substantial legal reform process and yet there are threatened cuts to Family Court mediation and counselling. Everyone knows that matters surrounding divorce, property settlement and custody often provoke violence. To cut those programs is short-sighted indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to that, there are a number of threats to family incomes, threats to the Medicare rebate, extra state taxes and charges, extra costs to families in Austudy and HECS, and there will be a particular impact for regional communities in things like cutting the diesel fuel rebate. These will all have an impact on families' incomes. Again, financial problems are almost always likely to produce difficulties in the domestic environment and the wider family. So if the government is really serious about the control of violence in our community, and although we certainly welcome the controls on guns and firearms legislation—we have always been behind it—it must be much broader than that.

At the time there was a lot of talk about those events but, ultimately, nothing was done when the political imperative required that something be done. The community cannot tolerate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular, the weapon that was used at Port Arthur.

The proposed legislation might prevent a Port Arthur from occurring.

         But what the House won't know, because it has never been put on the public record before, is what happened to two of my constituents, David and Josie Powers, after the Kennetts decided to get out of the Ultrafine business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In October 1991, Jeff Kennett told Mr and Mrs Powers, the founders of Ultrafine, that he wanted out of the business. They were able to buy him out with a Commonwealth Development Bank loan. The books provided by Felicity and Jeff Kennett claimed that Ultrafine had recorded a $5,000 profit over the previous seven months. But Kennett would not allow Mr and Mrs Powers to examine the books until 9 January 1992, the day before settlement was due.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When David and Josie Powers did examine the books, the books did not seem right. They quickly discovered a $10,000 error. They faxed this information to the Kennett solicitors insisting on a $10,000 adjustment and a clause in the agreement which would force Mr Kennett to make good any further errors uncovered on a more detailed examination of the books.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After the settlement, Mr O'Sullivan's brother, a chartered accountant, went through the books thoroughly. Instead of a $5,000 profit, the company had made a $166,000 loss. No wonder the Kennetts wanted out. Mr O'Sullivan, the accountant, made the observation that a child of three could have kept a better set of books. An account of $6,500 had been presented twice. But the biggest payment
         <break page="1983" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          was of over $50,000 to KNF, the Kennetts' own company. The invoices to KNF had been written out one after the other immediately prior to the sale, clearly after the Kennetts had realised that they were going to be bought out.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The state election was approaching in 1992. The Powers wanted to recover the $160,000 from the Kennetts. They were prepared to go public on the matter. However, Mr O'Sullivan, a staunch Western District Liberal, was having none of this. He insisted that the matter be dealt with behind the scenes and offered to use his Liberal Party connections to set things right.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, publicity before the state election would have taken the gloss off Kennett's knitting mill venture and the strong inference that Kennett had attempted to defraud his business partners would have been very damaging to his reputation in small business and the general community. It probably would not have looked too good either if KNF's figures had come out prior to the 1992 election. Over the previous three years, it had made a loss. Mr Kennett could not run a small business successfully.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr and Mrs Powers had concluded that, during the years of opposition, KNF was simply a front and that there was no advertising work being conducted at the Warrigal Road premises. But the matter was hushed up.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After the election, Mr O'Sullivan did write to the new Premier pointing out the errors in the accounts and seeking redress. The Premier's solicitors wrote back telling him to get lost. So the Powers and the O'Sullivans sought legal advice. That advice suggested that they take legal action against the Kennetts and seek to recover $120,000. But that advice was never acted on because a set of events was about to unfold which would destroy the Powers' business interests completely and cause them to regret the day they met Jeff Kennett on the steps of Parliament House.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Enter Philip Gardiner, financier and founding director of the Macquarie Bank, the very bank which is financing Crown Casino and Transurban City Link—Mr Kennett's two favourite projects. Mr Gardiner's assets are
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          believed to exceed $20 million and his company involvements are many. Why would he be interested in being a shareholder in this small struggling company?

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Gardiner and two wool growers offered to invest in Merino Gold, a subsidiary company of Ultrafine. They offered to buy 38 per cent of Merino Gold on the basis of 300,000 shares at $1 each. Strangely enough, when the Powers went back to them and said that the cost of the shares would be $1.42 each, they did not bat an eyelid. Mr Gardiner was obviously very keen to get in on this company.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the new shareholders got in, what did they do? Mr Gardiner immediately proposed that Ultrafine be dissolved and that the company be run through the Merino Gold subsidiary. This was an illogical proposal except for one thing. Ultrafine was the company which had the right to sue the Kennetts. With Ultrafine dissolved, the Premier could go on his merry way free of the fear of litigation and free of being unmasked as someone who had attempted to defraud his small business partners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr and Mrs Powers resisted this move, so Mr Gardiner and the other new shareholders also moved on the other part of their plan—to get rid of Mr and Mrs Powers. Given that the Powers had all the technical expertise of the company and that it was their baby, this move was very strange. Nevertheless, Mr Gardiner proceeded. In January 1995, Mr and Mrs Powers were dismissed as managing directors and the locks on the Ultrafine building were changed. Employment contracts which had been drawn up for them were terminated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr and Mrs Powers' subsequent action for wrongful dismissal was an uphill battle. The new directors of Ultrafine and Merino Gold were holding a loaded financial gun at their heads. They could at any time liquidate the companies and the Powers would lose everything. The case was resolved with the Powers' properties being released from mortgage and them receiving three months pay of a two-year contract.

         So David and Josie Powers, two hard-working and decent private sector people who each had highly paid jobs and technical expertise which had them set for a comfortable retirement, are now both unemployed.

All their income from the Merino Gold venture has been consumed by legal fees.

         So their lives have been all but ruined. How did this happen?

         —Today I am very pleased to rise in the chamber to talk about the wonderful progress that has been achieved over the last couple of years towards the establishment of the Sunshine Coast University College, which was recently opened by the Governor of Queensland, Her Excellency Mrs Leneen Forde AC. I was honoured to be present at the opening of stage 1 of the university campus as the representative for the federal Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. My parliamentary colleague, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), was also present and we both have the honour of being the parliamentary representatives for the Sunshine Coast community.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The honourable member for Fairfax, like me, has been a strong supporter of the Sunshine Coast University College. We know that this is a very important institution and a very important base for the continued development of the region. It really ought to be highlighted that the opening of the Sunshine Coast University College is probably the last opening of a freestanding greenfield university that we can expect to see for a generation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is of course currently referred to as the Sunshine Coast University College. I hope that it is possible to allow the university to reflect its status as an independent institution. It ought to be able to drop the term `college', which tends to work against its continued growth and development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Other university colleges in this country are colleges of established universities whereas the Sunshine Coast University College is a freestanding institution with its own act of the
        <break page="1985" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Queensland Parliament. The sooner the Sunshine Coast University College is able to drop the `college' tag the better so that it will be able to grow, prosper and continue to perform a very important role of providing tertiary education in the Sunshine Coast area. The university will be a focal point for the region as a whole. It will serve as a tremendous asset for the Sunshine Coast community and indeed for employment growth.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opening of stage 1 by Her Excellency the Governor represented a very great moment for the Sunshine Coast. I remember over 10 years ago that a committee was formed on the Sunshine Coast to push for a tertiary institution in our area. Many people at the time said that Mrs Alison Kerr-Jones, one of the visionaries behind the university, would not be able to achieve what ultimately now exists in bricks and mortar. The critics were proved wrong. The Sunshine Coast community worked together as a region and we now have a freestanding greenfield university which has been able to attract staff of very great calibre and quality from right around the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was impressed to see a very large cross&amp;hyphen;section of the Sunshine Coast community at the official opening. Professor Paul Thomas, the founding vice-chancellor of the university, has done a wonderful job of building up this institution from scratch. As I go around the various chambers of commerce and other community groups in my electorate, I find Paul Thomas there. He never misses an opportunity to promote the Sunshine Coast University College and to encourage its continued expansion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a competitive society universities must go out and market themselves. No longer can they expect that automatically they will receive funding and that as a matter of course everything will fall into their laps. Paul Thomas has been innovative and is a person to whom the Sunshine Coast owes a very great debt. If it had not been for Paul Thomas, the university would not have got off to the excellent start that it has this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will have its own degrees and full-time staff who have taught and researched at other universities. Of course, the university will have a policy and financial commitment to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         support both teaching and research—and that is vital if a university is going to be successful. The university will also have a clear intention to be both regionally and internationally significant.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was just one of those events where I, as a Sunshine Coast representative, was able to take great pride in what we have been able to achieve as an area. The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing parts of Australia and projected continued growth indicates that this will go on into the future. A strong university presence is important, vital and necessary—and now we have it. It is essential that government continues to support the growth of the Sunshine Coast University College.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand that demand for places at the university college has been very strong, that most of the students are local and that many of them put down the Sunshine Coast University College as their first choice of a tertiary institution to attend. The fact that this has happened is testimony to the very strong backing the Sunshine Coast University College enjoys right throughout the region.

        It must also be recognised that all universities had modest beginnings.

My view is that, without a doubt, the Sunshine Coast University College will take its place among the best of Australia's universities in the next century as an independent institution. It has obviously had the opportunity to draw on the experiences of others. I believe it will build on those experiences, and it will certainly have a focus on the future.

         I must say that I am genuinely impressed with the quality of the academic staff the university has been able to attract. I am indebted to the Chancellor, Mr Justice Fitzgerald, for the information he provided in his address at the opening of the university. He said that there were 1,700 applicants from around the world for the first 20 or so posi tions advertised.

        It is obvious that this institution has an important role to play in the future of the Sunshine Coast. I know that the government has inherited an $8 billion black hole as a result of mismanagement by the former Labor government. I can see the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) is nodding in agreement at the fact that we have to plug the $8 billion black hole that his colleagues left for us. We intend to do so. I hope that in doing so it will be possible to make sure that we have in place policies which will guarantee the continued growth of the Sunshine Coast University College. The college's opening this year was much overdue, but the college offers great opportunities to people on the Sunshine Coast and throughout the state.

        The government must recognise—and I believe it has—that Queensland, historically, has been disadvantaged regarding university places. As people move from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to places like the Sunshine Coast, it is important that university places go with them. It is quite unfair that thousands of students in Queensland are simply unable to obtain a place in a tertiary institution whereas, in southern states, many of the universities are struggling to fill their existing quotas.

But I would have been more pleased had he referred in passing to the potential loss of a university in Queensland, namely, the campus at Ipswich which I had an opportunity to visit last week. I would have thought that he, with his very close friend the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), ought to be raising this important issue in the House so as to ensure that the commitment given by the previous government to establish a university at Ipswich is delivered.

        The issue I seek to raise this afternoon is rather timely in the light of last week's meeting of COAG and the serious impact Treasurer Costello's agreement with the premiers will have on ordinary PAYE taxpayers. My grievance relates to the government's failure to act against wealthy tax cheats in Australia. In the recent election campaign, the coalition paraded around the country claiming that they would not introduce any new taxes. Mr Costello, in particular, smugly claimed this.

       <para first-indent="16">
        During the election the ALP announced a plan to raise $800 million from 100 of the wealthiest tax avoiders in Australia, many of whom are friends of the government. The unfortunate situation is that the lot on the other side of the chamber did not like that, but they were shamed at that time into saying that they would also match the commitment given by the Labor government of the day. But not now—oh, no, it's too difficult. The government wants to let them get away with it, just like they did in the bottom of the harbour days when the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer.

         The government in which John Howard was Treasurer pursued so-called dole bludgers but was more than happy to let its tax avoiding friends rake in their ill&amp;hyphen;gotten gains. In the same way today, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say that it is too hard to collect the huge sums in unpaid tax from wealthy partici pants and family trusts. I think it is high time that this nation required the government to deliver on its commitment to the Australian electorate in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the last federal election to act, and to act decisively, on the question of tax avoidance and the existence of family trust schemes.

        It is interesting to note in passing that it is not too hard to knock off the tax concessions for research and development which, as the Metal Trades Industry Association has rightly said publicly on a number of occasions, have brought great benefits to the Australian economy and are vital for the nation's future. Nor is it too hard to take a paltry tax concession off struggling building workers with respect to their travelling allowances. It is not too hard to blunder into last week's COAG conference and to try to make tax changes which would have cost 30,000 car sales and 4,000 jobs in the car industry and, at the same time, suggest that there ought to be new taxes on pencils and chalk in state schools and on babies' bottles in public hospitals. One law for the rich—the mates of those on the other side of the chamber—and one law for the poor. That is the tories' way—always has been and always will be.

        I know why some on the other side of the chamber are concerned about this issue: because of some of their mates.

         Dr Kemp keeps complaining about the fact that we were prepared to spend a couple of billion dollars to assist the long-term unemployed back to work, but he does not care about the much greater cost to the country, including the budget deficit, of not getting unemployment down—estimated, I might say, at $40 billion. Forty billion dollars is not chicken feed. Nor does the government care at all about getting those 100 rich tax avoiders to pay up the $800 million that they are depriving the nation of and which would go towards helping the unemployed, supporting labour market programs and creating new jobs.

        Some people like to compare Australia's tax levels with those of our Asian neighbours rather than with other member countries of the OECD. I suggest this gives a misleading picture of us as a high tax country.

        It is much more accurate to compare us with the other members of the OECD. What this comparison shows is that in the early 1990s Australia became the lowest taxed country in the Western world. One of the main policy challenges of the 1990s and beyond will be to ensure that national governments do gain sufficient revenue to look after the many people dislocated by economic restructuring. More revenue will need to be raised. What better opportunity is there than taxing family trusts?

        The question I pose is: how should this revenue be raised? In recent times we have again seen new calls for a goods and services tax. All I can say from the opposition's point of view is that we will never support such a regressive tax because it will inevitably hit the poor hardest. But, unlike the government, we certainly will insist and do everything to ensure that the wealthy do pay their fair share of tax.

In that context are they prepared to act on their election promise and hit family trusts, instead of the milk bottles supplied for new-born babies in public hospitals? That is the real question that the government of the day ought to front up to. It is no longer acceptable to say that taking on family trusts is too difficult when, at the recent COAG conference, the Treasurer suggested that we ought to attack the automobile industry, reduce the job opportunities in places such as Geelong and South Australia, impose new taxes on public hospitals and schools and, by doing so, impose yet another tax burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers.

         —It is with a little bit of a heavy heart that I participate in the grievance debate this evening. I want to highlight to the House the absolute dilemma the beef industry is in at the moment. It is one of the primary industries at the centre of primary production in my electorate.

        This dilemma has been brought to my attention obviously by a number of my constituents. Importantly, I recently read in a paper a letter to the editor from Mr Jim Henderson of Gloucester. I wish to read some extracts of that because it highlights the seriousness of the problem. He says:

        Two years ago a 370kg grass-fed Jap Ox carcass was worth $980. Today it is worth $460. A large proportion of the $1.30 per kg drop to producers can be attributed to the increased value of the Australian dollar.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        While returns to producers have dropped by half, production costs from items such as rates, fuel, seed, fertiliser, drench etc. have all increased in price. During the same period, producers have battled one of the worst droughts on record, and farm debt has gone up.

        If we look at some of the statistics on beef prices and market share we will see that current beef prices have fallen 40 per cent on average since December 1995. Prices are the lowest in actual dollar terms since 1982&amp;hyphen;83. Prices in real terms—minus inflation—are equal to the lowest prices ever received for beef; that is, going back to 1975 at the height of the beef crash.

        There has been significant loss in Australia's market share in a number of key export markets. The following figures are quite compelling. In 1994 we had 53 per cent of the market in Japan; in 1996 we have 45 per cent. In 1994 we had 43 per cent of the market in Korea; in 1996 we have 27 per cent. In 1994 we had 70 per cent of the market in Taiwan; today we have 50 per cent. Much of that market share has been lost to the USA and New Zealand. The US share of the Japanese market has gone from 43 per cent to 50 per cent. New Zealand is about to overtake Australia in terms of market share in Korea. Some of the causes of the dilemma in the beef industry at the moment are the US beef oversupply, the increase in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost disadvantages facing the Australian beef industry; that is, processing costs and industrial relations—waterfront reform, transport and so on.

        One of the areas that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the government have taken steps to address is AMLC promotions. Over the past three or four years there has been a steady decline in funding for the whole range of AMLC programs, including the Japanese market promotional program. This has been due to a cut in processor levies since March 1993. This has been using up a lot of the AMLC cash reserves.

         Let us compare that with the budget that is being expended in the growing marketplaces. In 1994&amp;hyphen;95 in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia—that excludes Korea, Japan and China—the budget was only $1 million. Only $1 million was spent on promotion in that area, when developing nations like Indonesia and the Philippines are looking for live cattle exports—and sheep exports as well. At the same time, $23 million is being spent on promotion in the domestic market.

        The minister has established the meat industry review task force which is reviewing the activities of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Council. The task force is looking at three key areas and is going to report back to the minister on all options for reform of the meat industry. It will be reviewing the performance of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Council. It is going to recommend to the minister a number of specific areas in which the government can take immediate action so that we can try to address some of the problems that have beset the beef industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        From a personal perspective, I would hope that that review is also going to look at the structure of the AMLC. In other areas of primary production, for instance wool and wheat, we have individual entities promoting individual products. Within the gamut of the AMLC there are probably four product areas: beef, sheep meat, live sheep and live cattle. I do not believe they should all be lumped together. There are conflicting interests in those four areas and they should be separated. I am hopeful that the review that is being undertaken into the AMLC and the Meat Research Council, on behalf of the government, will address that very issue of what I perceive as a conflict of interest between those competing sectors of the meat production and processing industries in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I certainly hope this review will result in the AMLC being more flexible and accountable. The beef industry expects and deserves better value for its dollar as far as promotion is concerned. I do not believe it is getting value for dollar. Hopefully this review will ensure that the levies the producers pay in the

        We have grappled for a lot of years with a marketing and grading system for the beef industry in this country but within this industry, as in a lot of other rural industries, it is difficult to get consensus on grading. It seems that, before we can get consensus, we have to get to the stage where the demise of the industry is imminent. That is a sad situation and a sad indictment of a lot of the players within the production and processing parts of the industry. It is high time we got a universal grading system across the spectrum in the beef industry, one that is recognised domestically and internationally, so we get faith in the industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Madam Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that the grading system should be an objective measurement using criteria such as age, muscle or marbling, fat cover and meat colour. Feeding regime—that is, grass fed or grain fed—should not be a grading criterion. It is a description in the marketplace, not a grading criterion. Terms like `export quality' and `A&amp;hyphen;grade beef' should be eliminated from the beef industry vocabulary because they draw attention to one thing or another. We export all sorts of differing grades of beef, not just `export quality' beef. We have to get back to an objective grading system.

        There has been a substantial decline in the quality of the Snowy River both in southern New South Wales below Jindabyne and in the more southerly areas in the lower part of Victoria. The weir at Dalgety silted up in

        The Snowy Mountains scheme sends roughly half of the flow from the Snowy River to the Murray and roughly half to the Murrumbidgee via Lake Jindabyne, Lake Eucumbene and the Tumut River. Recently, as a result of agitation and effort by people in the Orbost region, an expert panel was put together consisting of people with expertise in areas such as freshwater ecology, hydrology, and the like, to examine what needs to be done to revive the Snowy River to bring it back, if not to its original glory, at least to some sort of shadow of its original state and not let it remain in the dilapidated state in which it is now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This expert panel found that there is major siltation in many areas of the river; that the intrusion of saltwater has come so far up the river that it is now past Orbost, so that is somewhere in the vicinity of seven to 10 miles upstream from the mouth of the river; that there has been a drastic reduction in the diversity of fish and macro&amp;hyphen;invertebrates; and that the biology of the lower parts of the river now resembles a lake—and, indeed, there are substantial sections of the river near Marlo which, to the eye, look much more like a lake than a river. The expert panel also found that there is severe weed invasion and alteration of vegetation on the banks of the river. It recommended that the annual flows to the river in the Victorian areas be increased by 500 per cent; that obstacles to fish migration upstream be reduced and removed; that there be a substantial research program initiated by state and federal governments; and that there be a proper vegetation management plan implemented.

        Apart from the environmental damage that has been sustained, other effects have occurred as a result of the reduced flow of the Snowy River. There is less water for farmers in the Orbost district. There has been a reduction in the possibility of a pulp mill being established—and this has been a great goal of many in the district for many years; it is one which I have some reservations about but, if it could be an environmentally friendly
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         pulp mill, I would happily support it—because of the need for water for any such pulp mill. Also, of course, the prospects for tourism are reduced—not only whitewater rafting and other things that might be associated with further upstream but also tourism in the vicinity of Orbost and Marlo where there are many potential tourist attractions which are not being helped by having a river with large sand islands in its middle rather than a river with a substantial flow.

        Unfortunately, there are some barriers to achieving change. One is that the Snowy Mountains Hydro&amp;hyphen;electricity Authority is due to be corporatised in September this year. Reduced flows for the Snowy Mountains scheme would mean reduced business and reduced profits for the authority. So it is vital that these environmental issues are resolved and a proper plan put in place, first, before corporatisation is proceeded with. Secondly, water that is currently diverted to the Murray and Murrumbidgee is used for irrigation and the users are now trying to claim that they have some sort of ownership or right of resource security over that water. I doubt whether people in the Orbost district are too pleased with that sort of claim.

        In 1994 a COAG statement was made with respect to water resources policy in which it was determined that governments would make `appropriate allocations to the environment in order to enhance and restore the health of river systems'. There would be substantial benefits to the Snowy River, its natural environment and the people of East Gippsland if the flow of the Snowy were increased to 25 per cent of the original flow, which would amount to about 800 megalitres per day. There would be some costs—a slight increase in salinity in the lower Murray, less production of electricity and, of course, less irrigation water for people relying on the Murray and the Murrumbidgee, although there would be some positive environmental benefits for the Tumut River.

This issue is certainly one that people in the East Gippsland area have been well aware of for many years, but now it is starting to attract some national media attention. It has also attracted the attention of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which I am pleased to see. Policy makers are also starting to consider the consequences—both the indirect and the perhaps unforeseen consequences—of the Snowy Mountains scheme for people in areas like East Gippsland.

        It is great to see that at last the voices of the people in the East Gippsland area are being heard. It is a fairly lightly populated region. As I indicated, the decisions which were made with respect to the flow of the Snowy many years ago were based purely on the notional water needs of what was then a very small population, without considering some of the important, broader implications for the natural environment and the other potential water resource uses.

        In conclusion, I would call on the Victorian state government, the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government—potentially in a coordinating role, but with greater emphasis on the Victorian government—to start treating this issue seriously and to start developing a management strategy to ensure that the Snowy River can flow properly again, that the terrible depredation of the river that has occurred as a result of the Snowy Mountains scheme can at least partly be reversed and that a longstanding injustice can be reversed.

        I should also state that it would not normally be my practice to have us regulate and legislate against those who are law-abiding citizens; rather, we should seek to punish those who do the wrong thing. They are words similar to the expression of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he first spoke to the House about this matter some months ago. I also think my viewpoint is somewhat consistent with what I told gun lobbyists in my electorate before the election. I told them very simply that legitimate, law-abiding gun owners had nothing to fear under a coalition government.

        It is certainly time now to deal with the facts and not the folklore. I am sure—as you would realise, Madam Deputy Speaker—that there is a great deal of folklore floating around in the community. I welcome the initiative of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Prime Minister to advertise over the next couple of weeks and state clearly just what the new proposed laws are. I believe those laws which have been adopted by the states and territories will be well received by the vast majority of Australians—even some of those who are currently protesting—once they know what the facts are.

        It disturbs me right off the top to note that some people believe the new laws which have been offered, suggested and adopted by the states mean that there is going to be a total ban of guns in Australia. It certainly disturbs me to see average Australians believe their constitutional rights are suddenly being threatened because they believe they once had a constitutional right to carry a weapon. I do not see this anywhere in our constitution, but a lot of people clearly believe that it is there.

        These people also firmly believe they will no longer be able to defend themselves if someone should attack them. Again, this is arrant nonsense.

        I find it quite sad to see so many law-abiding, decent Australians who have always maintained a great belief in democracy—the rule of the majority—are now openly discussing ways to blatantly break new laws, simply because they find themselves in a minority. These people call this civil disobedience, but it will do nothing to advance their argument. As I said, they are doing absolutely no justice to themselves and they will only continue to frighten more and more Australians who do not want to see semiautomatic and automatic weapons so widely available.

         Let me state again for the record the groups of people who will have a genuine reason for possessing or using a firearm. They will include sporting shooters who use lawful firearms and have a valid membership of an approved club; recreational shooters and hunters who produce proof of permission from a public or private landowner; people with an occupational requirement—for exam ple, primary producers, other rural workers, security employees and professional shooters for nominated purposes; bona fide collectors of firearms; and people with other limited purposes which are authorised by legislation.

        In closing, I say again that the great majority of the constituents of Moreton are certainly behind the tightening of gun laws and support the leadership which the Prime Minister has shown. We certainly do not want to live in a wild west kind of world which some people, even in this place, seem to want to promote. We know the new laws will not offer the guarantees which we would all like, but if we as parliamentarians had not tried to go down this path then I think we would have failed the great majority of people in this country. I call on those who class themselves as law&amp;hyphen;abiding Australians, gun owners, who may or may not be affected by the facts which underlie the laws, not the folklore, to accept the majority rule on this—to obey the laws and not to break them.

        Many members will be aware that my father was the member for Hunter up until March this year. I have to say that 1995 was a difficult year for the former member. Notwithstanding the obvious effects of drought in many areas of the Upper Hunter, RASAC, the body charged with making recommendations to the minister regarding the designation of exceptional circumstances areas, continued to deny many areas of my electorate drought assistance. I understand that RASAC considers meteorological, agronomic, economic and environmental conditions when assessing an area.

        Finally, and thankfully, by the end of last year most areas in my electorate were granted exceptional circumstances classification.

Why? On the advice of RASAC.

         Before I say another word, I want to assure the House that the Upper Hunter is still very much in drought. I will not ask honourable members to take my word; rather, I will quote from the front page of an Upper Hunter newspaper, dated 3 June 1996:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Almost all of the Upper Hunter remains drought declared as farmers start to prepare for the added burden of winter and its usual slow growth conditions. The entire Scone and Merriwa rural lands protection districts had been included on the drought declaration list for June. Parts of the Denman and Singleton rural lands protection district are also on the drought list.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Merriwa rural lands protection board protection spokesman, Kevin O'Malley, said that the start of winter frosts already was short&amp;hyphen;circuiting any benefit last month's rain might have had on encouraging pasture growth in his area. He said:

         The situation, according to the paper, is similar to that in the Singleton&amp;hyphen;Denman area, where farmers are facing the problem of not only not having the money to buy grain to feed their cattle but also not wanting to sell them in a market which is so depressed. In the Scone rural lands protection board area, veterinarian John Entwistle tells us that the drought is still having a very strong effect. Let me share with the House what the member for Gwydir had to say on 29 March last year:

They are ruled ineligible because of a rigid set of rules, a narrow set of criteria. What is at fault? It can only be the criteria. Why is there not a willingness to do that which, as I have said, I am sure the Australian people not only expect will be done but no doubt believe is being done to meet those welfare and educational needs of those families in real crisis?

          This is absolutely extraordinary stuff. This is the ultimate in hypocrisy coming from members on the other side. Senator Sandy Macdonald, speaking again on RASAC on 29 November 1995, said:

          The decision to revoke exceptional circumstances criteria will be devastating for people in the Upper Hunter.

          Senator Tierney, in his speech of 29 March 1995, gives examples of those who will be adversely affected by the denial by RASAC, and by implication the former government, of exceptional circumstances criteria.

          Senator Tierney wants to suggest now, I assume—just 12 months later and with beef prices so depressed—that this gentleman no longer needs assistance. I suspect that the invitation to the National Party to become a partner in government was a token gesture only. I can only assume that to be the case, because it is obvious to me and it must be obvious to all members of this House that the voice of the National Party is not being heard in cabinet. The National Party members can do one of two things: they can start to stand up for rural and regional Australia and represent the people they purport naturally to represent or they can do the honourable thing and get out of government entirely.

I listened with interest to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in his contribution to this debate and I agree entirely with what he had to say—it is my experience—but I am prompted to make some brief comments because I have just had a note passed to me in the chamber which says, `Please come up to the office as soon as possible as there has been a bomb threat at Clifford Gardens shopping centre in Toowoomba and the caller has associated himself with the gun lobby people.'

         last 10 days, I take exception to this. I apologise for my emotional outburst, but I think it is something that goes to the heart of the problem. What concerns me is that here is a Prime Minister (Mr Howard), with the strong support of both sides of the House, exercising some national leadership and, in doing so, he has taken up the challenge of some of the fringe dwellers. What concerns me about this whole debate is the fact that it is not about responsible gun ownership at all; it is about the generation of what I would term a militia culture. It is about time that some of these fringe dwellers and the `looney tunes', as I refer to them, stood up and really showed themselves for what they are.

        The honourable member for Moreton made a very valid comment about the degree to which it is the silent majority that should count in this debate and not the vociferous empty vessels that make up some of the minority views. That is not to criticise the thousands of responsible gun owners and shooters—sporting shooters in particular—around the country. What it does is highlight the fact that there is a small group in our community at the moment which are attempting to hijack this debate for their own ends. There are a number of people out there who would have us indulge in something that this nation does not want.

        As an example, I had two meetings in my electorate last week involving over a thousand people, and I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to members in the chamber that the vast majority of the people who were at those meetings were against me because I was seen as a conduit to what the Prime Minister was standing up for in this very strong debate. After one of the meetings I was physically threatened and told, `We would like to shoot you, Mr Taylor.' I take exception to that sort of comment, even perhaps made as flippantly as it might have been made. I took it very seriously and I continue to take it very seriously. I take it seriously not just for me, but for my wife, who is at home and, of course, unable to defend herself. I would hope that those extremists out there will take on board what is a very difficult situation for all of us in this place.

         To give you an extreme example, last Wednesday evening there was a meeting in Toowoomba involving something like 700 or 800 people from outside my electorate; a lot of these people are being bussed and driven in to beat the whole thing up. A gentleman who was obviously at the meeting faxed a message to me on Friday, and this is the sort of extreme view with which we are faced. He wanted to know whether I was a constitutionalist, whether I was a federalist or whether I was an internationalist. He wanted to know because he wanted to make up his mind whether I was a fool, whether I was a liar or whether I was a traitor. I very quickly replied to him in a letter which I hope he has received today, and I hope he understands what I had to say. I made the point to him that I am none of those things: I would hope I am not a fool, I am certainly not a liar and I most certainly am not a traitor. What I am is an Australian who is very proud to stand up to people like this; people who, if they had their way, would inject a degree of anarchy into this country which we cannot afford.

They can go back to 1688, they can go back to Magna Carta, they can do as they want to; but there is no constitutional right in this country to own and to use firearms. I say to them that we have had enough of this militia culture, we have had enough of the international conspiracy and we have had enough of their nonsense as they tend to rabblerouse in some of these meetings.

         There is one other dimension to it. Whilst some of them out there, the fringe dwellers, continue to generate this sort of environment, there are a number in this parliament who have indicated that this has the potential for violence. Those in this parliament who suggest that and who go out and actively get involved with some of these groups do us and the nation a great disservice. They exacerbate what is already a very difficult situation physically and otherwise for everybody in this House and for people right around the country. I did not intend to speak on this subject; I was going to speak on something quite different in terms of treaty processes, but having listened to the member for Moreton and having been passed a note, I felt duty bound to say that. I hope that everybody in the House agrees with me.

         —I indicate at the outset that the opposition, without reservation, supports both the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996 as part of the Commonwealth's response to the horrific events at Port Arthur. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech said that this tragedy has concentrated attention on the fact that there are large holdings of types of rapid fire weapons in our community which is simply not justifiable in the overall national interest.

        It is true that all state governments are acting on this matter and that there is overwhelming cross&amp;hyphen;party support for the implementation of what the government is doing. That is as it should be because this transcends party politics. Sadly, there is not a unanimous point of view on this issue across the country. Some members of parliament hold strong views that do not accord with the view of the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians. Everyone is entitled to their point of view. We should not be frightened to debate matters. But we should not have threats made to either side that hold different points of view. That is not the Australian way; that is not the way we do these things. I understand that some people who have a different view from me hold that view legitimately and honestly. But for the life of me I cannot see the need for these weapons in the community.

         I do not believe in the right to bear arms. I believe that it is a limited right. It is a right which should be exercised by the armed forces, the military forces, the police and in other limited instances. The best estimate at the moment is that it will cost around $500 million to buy back these weapons. Certainly, that is a very large cost. It is through a one&amp;hyphen;off increase of 0.2 per cent in the Medicare levy that these bills will raise the necessary funds to reimburse states and territories for the direct cost of payments that they will have to make to relevant gun owners.

         The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936 on the payment of a proportion of the full Medicare levy equivalent to a rate of 0.2 per cent by defence personnel and their relatives or associates who are currently exempt from the Medicare levy. So, basically, all sections of the community are involved in this levy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is only a one&amp;hyphen;year impost. The government can be confident that we in the opposition will not in any way attempt to score political points on this levy. This is a right and just way of sharing the burden of the buyback. It is a small price for us as a community to pay to have some of these weapons taken out of our community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is disturbing that there is a lot of misinformation in the community about what the government is doing and the consequences of its legislation. All I say to people is: if you require information on the buybacks then contact your local member of parliament. Don't act on misinformation. The tragedy is that some people in the community are playing on people's fears and prejudices and are using this to stir up hatred and antagonism to what the government is doing. It is very easy to take easy political decisions. This is not an easy political decision for some members of the government and, indeed, for some members of the opposition because of the nature of their electorates. Those particular members are to be applauded for taking the courageous view and supporting what the government is doing.

        The purpose of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill is to establish a mechanism for raising funds to allow the Commonwealth to compensate state and territory governments for the buyback of prohibited firearms. This bill provides the financial underpinning for the compensation proposal in the resolutions for effective nationwide controls on firearms made by all state and territory governments at the special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May this year.

        According to figures provided by the Australian Institute of Criminology from its national homicide monitoring program, for the four-year period from July 1989 to June 1993 there were 1,267 homicides in Australia.

        Immediately following the Port Arthur tragedy, I convened a special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council to which I took a detailed proposal for removing high&amp;hyphen;powered guns from the community and controlling rigorously the licensing, ownership and use of all remaining firearms.

        There has been much public discussion of the council's resolutions in the weeks following the meeting.

        In summary, shooters throughout Australia will continue to own and use firearms, provided they can demonstrate a reason, one or more of a need or an occupational requirement, depending upon which category of firearm they seek. In many cases, gun owners will still qualify to use a firearm but will qualify only for a lower powered or less dangerous firearm than that to which they are accustomed. The Australian governments are of the view that this will not prevent shooters from hunting or practising their sport. Many experienced shooters, particularly those involved in primary production, have written to the Prime Minister and to me to say that the single shot or repeating action rifle or shotgun is their firearm of choice and that they can see no need for anything more powerful.

        The second initiative in the package agreed to on 10 May 1996 is a register of firearms in every state and territory, linking the identifying details of every gun with every licensed owner across the country. Each jurisdiction will have access to each other's register through the police reference system, so that checks can be made on individual firearms as well as individual owners from one state to another. This measure will enhance greatly the safety of the public at large as well as that of police officers attending crime scenes.

        In addition to a firearms register, a system of permits will be introduced in every jurisdiction, whereby a person applying to acquire a firearm must seek fresh approval from the licensing authority for each acquisition. A waiting period will be imposed on each application, during which time authorities will examine the firearms register to confirm that the applicant is still a fit and proper person to possess a licence, and to find out how many other firearms he or she holds. However, this new permit system will not prevent an existing owner from acquiring further firearms. What it is intended to do is to place the onus upon that individual to prove that he or she has a reason for acquiring another firearm.

        One advantage of the new licensing arrangements is that there will be more consistency from one jurisdiction to another, both in the licensing standards and in the grounds upon which licences can be refused, cancelled or seized.

        The distinguishing feature of the amnesty agreed to by the police ministers is that the Commonwealth government has undertaken to encourage gun owners to comply by offering a major financial incentive to surrender their guns. The Commonwealth will provide, through state and territory governments, a fair and proper price for all prohibited firearms which have been surrendered by their owners. Many may wish to use their compensation money to buy a firearm of a non-prohibited type.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to the compensation scheme, all governments have agreed to legislate to provide for severe penalties for breaches of the new legislation, particularly breaches involving prohibited, high&amp;hyphen;powered weapons. The number of firearms affected by these prohibitions is difficult to determine but it is certainly in the hundreds of thousands. Any scheme to draw these weapons out of the community and to compensate the owners for their reasonable value is likely to be a major undertaking. It is an undertaking that the overwhelming majority of Australians want to see both started and implemented.

        <para>
         A landslide risk assessment report on Christmas Island tabled in October 1995 highlighted the possibility that rock falls could cause fatality, injury and damage to or loss of Commonwealth property and community assets. In this context the Attorney-General's Department advised that, as injury is foreseeable, the Commonwealth owes a duty of care to the people who occupy Commonwealth land and buildings in the Kampong and that it should implement all appropriate risk reduction strategies to reduce risk of injury to people or property in the Kampong area where that is reasonable.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The areas directly affected include Commonwealth owned high&amp;hyphen;density residential units—blocks 408 and 412—which are occupied by government employees and public housing tenants. There are also other Commonwealth and community used buildings which have been identified at risk, including the boat club area, the marine building, the Malay workshop and the Malay school.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In December 1995 the former government referred to the PWC proposals to relocate the affected residents and to construct rock fall defensive measures. The evidence subsequently prepared for consideration by the PWC indicated the proposed package would cost over $20 million but included a range of alternatives. The election was called before the PWC could visit the island to investigate the proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to referring the matter to the PWC, the former government approved an allocation of $1.191 million in 1995-96 for works associated with the proposals. This commitment was recently confirmed by the

         Although estimates for constructing only rock fall defences are less than the $6 million threshold for PWC consideration, those which involve relocation of residents exceed $6 million. When the risk evaluation results are available it is likely that the decision as to which is the most appropriate course of action will involve a balanced judgment, weighing up all the economic and social factors. Because of the potential effect on the community, the PWC is the most appropriate body to carry out the necessary investigations and to make recommendations to the government on this matter. I commend this motion to the House.

         —We support the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. This bill arises from those tragic circumstances in Port Arthur with which we are all in melancholy fashion familiar. From that point we came to the successful outcome that the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams), who is at the table, conducted along with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his relevant state counterparts by which, in return for the Commonwealth undertaking to fund the buyback of soon to be illegal weapons in Australia, they would agree to legislate in accordance with a series of propositions which dramatically reduce access to high&amp;hyphen;

        In order to be credible and ensure that the agreement sticks, it is absolutely essential that this legislation passes, and that is in no small part the reason for the opposition supporting it. We as a party have in government a reasonable and proud record, I believe, of attempting to persuade those in the political processes in Australia, now coming up with the right answers, to have tighter gun control.

        In the wake of the last most horrific massacres—those at Hoddle Street and Queen Street—the Commonwealth, the states and the territories back in 1987 formed a committee on violence and sought wide&amp;hyphen;ranging responses to the problem of violence in the Australian community. The committee's report in 1990 provided the blueprint for comprehensive reform. Following the Strathfield killings, the federal Labor government banned the importation of automatic submachine gun-like and high velocity weapons. In 1991 an agreement was reached on a national uniform gun licensing system, but some of the states subsequently resiled from it. In November of last year several years work on national uniform gun licensing laws by the former Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, was stymied by opposition from the states at a meeting in Hobart. The attempt to relaunch the debate in February of this year was cut short by the federal election.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So we have, as I said before, a record of strong support for the view that access to firearms, particularly high-powered and semiautomatic firearms, ought to be severely restricted. We were unsuccessful, having had several bites of the cherry, in persuading the states as to the validity of those views. I guess there is some indication, in the vehemence of opposition to the propositions now despite the very strong and obvious community support, why the states in the past may have been reluctant to move upon this. For whatever reason, those various attempts that we made failed, except in so far as we were completely in control of the process, including in relation to the importation of weapons.

         Minister's help. It is a good agreement. There is compromise in that agreement. There is reasonable provision made for people who have a legitimate reason for access to weapons. Of course, it is not a template for legislation that involves banning weapons. People will still have access to weapons they require for various purposes on quite reasonable conditions.

        The point is that a set of weapons which has no place in the civilian community outside those very limited circumstances will, as a result of these actions, now remain outside the civilian community. But, in order to achieve that and properly enforce it, the essential cog in that process will be this legislation. A reasonable price has to be offered. Many people in this community have acquired in absolutely good faith—and with absolutely no criminal intent of course—weapons now to be made illegal. Those weapons serve purposes which they personally consider entirely legitimate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is an environment in which it is extremely difficult for law enforcement officers to operate. To give them the best chance to operate in this environment, a just terms acquisition of the weapons is absolutely essential. I have no criticism of anything that the government has done to this point in this area. I would just make a couple of points here by way of suggestion. It would be wise to err on the side of generosity in evaluation of the weapons. They are not all of a uniform cost. Some weapons cost a great deal more. They do not have an antique character to them and are not semiautomatic. Nevertheless, they may have a longstanding familial connection. There needs to be, if this law is to be effectively enforced, a bit of give in that area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We all know who has to enforce these laws. It is not anybody sitting in this chamber, nor anybody sitting in any parliament. It is the police forces who, as individuals, have their own families to consider and their own concerns about life and limb who will have to approach people to take control of these weapons.

It is not as though these matters have not had a decent airing in the Australian community; they have had a very decent airing. It is not as though all the arguments are not known; they have been out there for a very long time. The point has come for conclusions, and the conclusions that have been reached have majority support. Therefore, there is no need for any hesitation in legislation, and the states ought to get on with it and complete the job.

        There are a few little observation points in the debate so far that I think are relevant to make here. Guns in our community inflict far more pain with far greater regularity than events at Port Arthur suggest. Over the 10 years from 1984 to 1994, nearly 80 per cent of firearm related deaths were suicides—that is 5,500 people. Firearm related suicide is a particular tragedy for Australia's rural communities and Australia's youth. A recent study shows that from 1989 to 1993 the firearm suicide rate amongst males aged between 15 and 24 was up to seven times higher in rural than metropolitan areas—31 versus 4 in 100,000. Without access to a firearm many of these people almost certainly would be alive today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unfortunately, guns contribute to the number of suicides by providing an all too accessible means of self&amp;hyphen;destruction for people in crisis. I will quote from a forthcoming article by Dr Michael Dudley et al entitled `Suicide Among Young Rural Australians 1964 to 1993—A Comparison with Metropolitan Trends'. It is going to be published in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the frequency, impulsivity and low intent of many youth suicide attempts, the association with drugs and alcohol, the role of peer networks and suggestibility, especially in relation to the media and the high lethality of guns, many attempts must be converted into deaths by the presence of a firearm.

        I realise that applies to all firearms, and it is not by any means the intention of this legislation to ban all firearms. The rural districts, of course, have the most legitimate reasons for access to and use of firearms. But, given that this exercise involves a licensing regime as well as particular restrictions on certain types of weapons, it is well to contemplate and comprehend that some of these elements of the issue do bear a deal of thinking about. It is not as though there is not a bit of knowledge out there as to the potential implications of the possession of weapons in certain circumstances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We do hear another argument from those who say they need weapons to ensure their own personal safety and that of their families. I do not doubt for one minute that these are honestly held concerns, particularly for women and families in remote areas. There is always going to be, in the bush in particular, a sense of distance from places of help and support, a sense of isolation and a proper concern for the requirements of self&amp;hyphen;defence. But it is clear that the incidence of self&amp;hyphen;defence in some so&amp;hyphen;called home invasion cases is far lower than the intensity of its reportage suggests. It is particularly tragic when the penalty for low-level breaking and entering becomes death.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also particularly tragic when a person possesses a firearm but may not be able to use it effectively, in which circumstances a weapon of defence becomes a weapon of attack. Anybody who has had any association with the military—and there are many around who have—would know that the correct and effective use of firearms is a skill which takes a while to acquire. Sensible storage is also an issue which does not always readily come to mind for the average owner of a firearm. Apart from anything else, the much more intense scrutiny that will go on as a result of the legislation introduced by the states into firearms ownership will increase a sense of obligation, I believe, on owners to properly make themselves aware of all the issues involved in the proper ownership, storage and usage of weapons.

         society in the right direction. Gun laws make a demonstrable difference to violence in society. Just consider the following figures. The United States has a virulent pro-gun culture and notoriously loose gun laws. Australia and Canada have comparatively stricter gun laws but, as we know, they are not the tightest in the world. The United Kingdom is widely regarded as having some of the strongest firearm laws in the world and a clear traditional belief that guns threaten peaceful society.

        So how do the homicide statistics compare? In 1994 firearm homicides in the United States comprised 70 per cent of a total homicide rate of nine people in every 100,000. In Australia and Canada firearm homicides comprised less than 30 per cent of a total homicide rate of around two people in every 100,000. In England and Wales firearm homicides were less than 10 per cent of total homicides, with a homicide rate of closer to one person in 100,000. One must always be careful with causality, but here we have three progressively tighter sets of gun laws, three progressively lower homicide rates and a progressively smaller firearms share of total homicides—tighter gun laws, fewer deaths and fewer of them caused by guns.

        This legislation will raise some $500 million towards the buyback scheme. I do not think any of us really know what the cost of the scheme is likely to be. We have some vague idea, and the $500 million mark was around the middle range of guesstimates that were put in place, as I seem to recollect, from the time of the Port Arthur massacre when we were all sitting down and mulling over these issues.

        Personally, I think it is probably a bit on the low side, in which case this may be an issue that needs to be revisited at some time. As I said in my remarks a bit earlier on, I think it would be most unwise for us to permit the states to be put in a position where a serious argument—as opposed simply to mischievousness—could be entertained that people were not being properly compensated, that people were not receiving value for what they put forward and that, therefore, people

        If the government found itself in a position where it did not have adequate resources, then I, on behalf the opposition, would not for one minute blame them. None of us know. If they needed to come back to the well, then we would be happy to consider that position favourably. It is absolutely important that this works and that it works in the next 12 months—and this is central to us being able to do that.

        I think it is important also for the states which have to handle this legislation. There is a small amount of evidence of a degree of backsliding in one particular state. The Attorney-General has indicated that he does intend to follow that up. I think it is very important that he does do that. Every state Premier, every state Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, knows that this has the support of a massive preponderance of the Australian community.

        The Prime Minister and the National Party are being admonished to sell this idea. There is a great deal of concern attached to an alleged failure to convince people of all of this. I really do not think there is any failure there at all. The issues are well known by those who are protesting. It does not really matter what the Prime Minister says; he will not convince any of them of the rightness of his cause. At some point in time in a democracy there is a vote and a conclusion is reached, albeit with all the consultation under the sun that has to be done. We have actually reached this point. There has been a lot of sensible adjustment around the edges to the agreement that has been reached. There does not need to be any more in that regard. The position has been reached where we ought to conclude these matters.

        My advice—so far as it is worth their while taking—to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Prime Minister is to stop worrying about it.

The seeming political storm around their ears is just that—seeming. It is not something that

We will give this legislation reasonably speedy passage, but in particular I hope that the legislation from the various states gets a speedy passage. This is an essential change. It is the right course of action. Just about every member of this parliament supports it.

        The Medicare levy is the appropriate vehicle for raising the funds necessary, as in every sense I see the gun control debate as a health issue. It is about the protection of human life not only in its literal form but also in terms of our national values and the priorities we attach to the protection of one another. The 0.2 per cent increase in the levy to 1.7 per cent of taxable income for one year will raise, as the Leader of the Opposition just said, around $500 million.

        The proposed legislation to be passed in each jurisdiction will effectively establish a national gun register of firearms, thereby linking a gun with every licensed owner.

Why not also identify both the gun and the owner?

         Recent comments by some parliamentarians advocating a gun owners' register as distinct from a gun register can be described only as unhelpful. As a strategy for curbing gun violence, seeking to register and control owners without also their guns will have little effect and represents a dangerous and orchestrated diversion from efforts to comprehensively reform gun laws. Whilst I am sure that the advocates of such registers are often well motivated by seeking to disarm what they consider to be the homicidal maniac who has managed to get a gun licence but not yet a gun, contrary to popular mythology, all but one of the perpetrators of Australian mass shootings since 1988 were not known to be dangerous. The gun lobby must understand that the most likely perpetrator of gun violence is not a criminal or a crazed maniac but the apparently normal gun owner who kills either himself and/or people who are close to him.

         It is the accessibility of guns themselves, not the holding of a licence by any particular member of that household, that creates the danger. If someone wants to report to police a dangerous person, it is absolutely essential that the police be able to establish whether there is access to a gun. A mechanism must exist which links the person to the gun.

         I also urge state and territory governments, in passing legislation to complement this Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, to consider mechanisms for automatically cancelling the gun licence of a person convicted of three successive drink driving offences, as it is well known that such individuals have a 90 per cent probability of alcohol dependence. Under these circumstances, such people often face personal, marital and economic hardship and may also be prone to irrational behaviour. I believe that this is incompatible with continuing to hold a gun licence.

         Equally, if individuals holding a gun licence are convicted of a drug or drug related offence, a mechanism should exist for automatically withdrawing their licence to hold a gun and for their firearms to be surrendered.

          As political representatives across the country are placed under increasing pressure to retreat from the position on gun control developed by the Prime Minister and the Australasian Police Ministers Council, it is our duty to keep bringing the issue back to what it is all about. It is not about the perceived rights of individuals to bear arms or the invasion of Australia by foreign forces and the conspiratorial theories of some extreme elements in the gun lobby. It is about the other 99 per cent of us saying that we have had enough. We are trying to do everything that we can to change the values and thinking of Australians, including our culture of violence, of which the gun issue is but one manifestation, and the right of families to live lives that as far as practicable are free from the fear of wanton mass destruction.

          Since 1992 we have averaged 620 gun deaths a year in Australia.

The gun laws which are proposed may not prevent another mass tragedy, and I suppose we will never know if they do. However, they will most certainly have a favourable impact on suicide by use of a firearm and on domestic violence involving guns. One study published in the

He found positive correlations between the rates of household gun ownership and the national rates of homicide and suicide as well as the proportions of homicides and suicides committed with a gun. There also appeared not to be a compensation process. Residents of countries with low rates of gun ownership did not use other means to commit homicide or suicide to make up for the absence of guns.

          In terms of the political agenda, the question is whether the ever increasing trend in gun ownership can be reversed as long as the possibility can be entertained that guns are not as dangerous as the observed correlations and commonsense would suggest. Unfortunately, any further waiting for more convincing evidence may jeopardise more rigorous approaches to gun control, since beyond a certain point significantly reducing the number of the guns in the hands of private citizens becomes a hopeless task. Therefore, the crucial policy question is: how much time do we have left to wait for more research, particularly in countries where
          <break page="2011" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          Through my 13 years in medical practice I have had a loaded gun pointed at me on two occasions. I have attended three shootings. In one case a child was fatally shot by his own brother. I have also attended a home where a man took a shotgun to his head in the lounge room whilst his family, including children, were in an adjoining room.

Thirty&amp;hyphen;five people lost their lives in the Port Arthur massacre.

         —Last Tuesday I attended a rally in Bathurst of 750 pro&amp;hyphen;gun supporters largely organised by the Sporting Shooters Association. It was billed as being a rally against the government and against all those who support the sort of legislation that the states and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have suggested. The meeting was organised in such a fashion that it was not confrontational. Many of those people were perhaps among the extremists in the pro&amp;hyphen;gun lobby. The meeting was very orderly. They heard what I had to say, which essentially was a total defence of the position of the Prime Minister and the states and a hope that the legislation could go through without any alteration.

        There was anger, of course, and there were extremely disappointed people who asked me whether there was any room for compromise, to which I largely said that I believed there was very little. I must commend the organisers of the meeting for the way in which they conducted it, unlike perhaps the meeting in Victoria yesterday. I agreed to take a petition from that meeting to deliver to this House. Much as I disagree with the contents of it, I saw it as my job as a representative of those people to present their point of view to this House. That petition was delivered today.

I see a middle range of people too—young people in particular—who come from fairly deprived circumstances, people who have probably been brought up in a working home where a firearm for sporting shooting was perhaps a pastime that their grandfather enjoyed during the Depression when they went out to shoot rabbits as perhaps their only means of food. That tradition has been handed on—that culture, if you like.

        So there are many supporters of both sides of politics in the range of opposition to these laws and many of them feel bewildered that they are losing a pastime and weapons that they saw as very much part of their culture, rightly or wrongly.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Then there is a third level—that caring, considerate group of people who would never present a threat to anyone with that weaponry. They realise, though, that they must surrender those firearms and make do. I believe they can make do—they say they can—with those categories that are being provided.
       </para>

        The supporters of these laws in my electorate—mainly women—outnumber by 15 to one those who are totally opposed to them. I think that women believe the only good gun law is one that has no guns in the community. But there are those who are collectors and who see their heirlooms being surrendered; they see things being taken away from them and they feel they are being blamed for something that they had nothing to do with. I said I could appreciate their point of view but that it certainly would not persuade me to alter my stance.

        The farmers I have met in my electorate largely see the need for such laws and they see plenty of scope within the categories offered to satisfied their requirements. The national gun register is seen in some areas as a threat to secrecy and something akin to the Australia card. When the question was raised about the identity of the gun that might or might not have been handed in a decade ago that could have turned up again in Tasmania, the Victorian police commissioner said it was essential that we had a national register to determine that very factor of where guns go across borders and who owns them.

I see concern amongst people about the licence fee, that it could be some sort of ongoing taxing instrument for the government. It should be built into the legislation somewhere that the licence fee be given a consumer price index rating and not suddenly lifted to tax people, particularly those who do not have many means but who enjoy sporting shooting as a pastime.

By the end of the day they had probably blown themselves away—and one or two of their children. That worried me and that drove me out of Sydney to a region where you are much more accountable for your coverage of such things. The media must examine their role in the coverage of situations where weapons are used. I hope that beyond these laws for firearms there will be an equally determined look at video violence,

The levy is currently set at 1.5 per cent of taxable income and will increase to 1.7 per cent for one year as a one-off moneys collection scheme to fund the compensation scheme which the states and territories will be required to pay gun owners as the nationwide ban on semiautomatic firearms comes into effect.

        Since that terrible Sunday afternoon at Port Arthur on 28 April, the debate about gun ownership in Australia has gone through at least two stages.

This included technical debate on what constituted a semiautomatic firearm and how gun owners were to be compensated.

        To his credit, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) moved quickly on the issue. After dialogue with state authorities, they came to an historic agreement to ban all semiautomatics except in some exceptional circumstances and to fund the buyback of these weapons with a one-off increase in the

        Since the agreement with the states, however, the debate on gun ownership has expanded to incorporate discussions over the threat to civil liberty and the right to bear arms. To some degree, the debate has been appropriated by a vocal and extremist minority. It is this development in the debate which I would like to address tonight.

        The right to bear arms in Australia is an implied right. It is not enshrined in the constitution, as it is in the United States.

        Unlike America, the necessity of owning a firearm has not been translated into an inalienable right.

The status of the United States as an independent republic was guaranteed only after the War of Independence, which was waged against the British not

        But Australia has no such history, nor has it witnessed the physical scale of such human conflict. This country was pioneered not with the gun but with innovation and perseverance—mostly against Australia's harsh environment—of explorers, humanitarians and settlers.

         —I rise to indicate strong support for the proposal to increase the Medicare levy to provide a fund to meet the cost of compensation for firearms which are surrendered following the adoption of uniform laws by the states and territories in the terms agreed on at the special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May.

        No reliable figures of total numbers of firearms in Australia are available. Estimates for all firearms vary from 3.5 million (as suggested to the National Committee on Violence) to over 10 million. Best estimates of the numbers of military-style semi-automatics suggest around 350,000 throughout Australia. Best estimates for other semi-automatic, self-loading or pump action longarms suggest around 3,000,000.

        The pro-gun lobby rally in Melbourne on 1 June attracted 70,000 protesters and there were 35,000 in Sydney last weekend.

        At its rallies the gun lobby has been promoting eight major fallacies. One: Shooters are equated with farmers. Farmers use guns as a necessity, not for pleasure, to protect or put down stock and to eliminate feral animals, including rabbits. But they do not insist on using military style weapons. Why should sporting shooters? The burden of proof to justify gun ownership and use must always be on the proponents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Two: Shooters are equated with soldiers. If the leaders of the gun community are at war, they have declared it on Australian democracy and the great majority of Australians, who abhor killing and killing machines. Australia has never relied on armed guerillas and it is impossible to imagine a situation where we could possibly need them. It is not part of our history or tradition.

        As the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) pointed out, the gun was central to the US frontier tradition but not to ours. Four US presidents were shot to death by gunmen and three more were shot at. One British Prime Minister was killed by a gun. No Australian Prime Minister, not even a Premier, has been killed by a gun. To equate the use of automatics and semiautomatics for private pleasure with the operations of Australian forces in both world wars is a grotesque distortion of our history. Using national shrines for pro-gun demonstrations was particularly offensive.

        Five: `Guns never hurt anyone.' This is Ted Drane's curious line. But guns are machines for killing and wounding; that is their primary purpose. A madman with a gun can inflict infinitely more damage in a few moments than a madman with an axe or a baseball bat. The roles of the human agent and his instrument are inseparable. I say `his' because gun ownership and use is overwhelmingly a male characteristic. The minute's silence for Port Arthur victims at gun rallies has been nauseating in its hypocrisy.

        Six: `Shooters are victims.' This is an example of special pleading. What is needed is full disclosure, rigid control and uniform laws throughout all states and territories, ensuring that weapons of mass destruction cannot be just bought over the counter. Where weapons are surrendered, there will be full compensation.

        Seven: `We are not guilty.' This has been a recurrent theme on campaign banners, and some have gone further: `What next—concentration camps?' Nobody is being charged generally or specifically with anything. There is no guilt by association. The old common law principle asserted that the right to use dangerous instruments and to have access to guns, poisons or explosives imposed a duty of care, and the community was entitled to be aware of risk—hence the need for full disclosure and transparency. Much of the objection of the gun lobby has been directed at registration of firearms, including an inventory of where the weapons are, how many there are and their capacity. But does anyone claim that compulsory registration of motor vehicles or that a poisons or explosives register overturns the presumption of innocence?

         Eight: `They're going to take all our guns.' Fears about the effects of compulsory registration of guns and uniform laws and regulations across all states and territories are wildly exaggerated. The argument is that, if govern ment—that is, the community—knows where the guns are, one day they will all be confiscated. Again, there is no basis for this, and the Attorney-General's paper asserts the contrary. The proposed ban essentially applies to military style weapons. A common thread running through this is the obsessional view that we face Armageddon, that an armed citizenry is the only line of defence against a baffling and threatening world and that government in a sense is part of the enemy and therefore government has to be resisted.

        The role of the armaments industry, another powerful lobby, deserves sharp scrutiny. In this time of political unity about gun controls, it is disappointing to reflect on lost opportunities in the past. John Cain attempted to bring in tough gun laws in the 1980s and was then vigorously opposed by the Liberal and National parties. In 1988 Barrie Unsworth, then New South Wales Premier, proposed tighter state and national gun laws, and strong attacks by the Liberal and National parties defeated his efforts and contributed to his defeat. As he turned on his heel, he said something that was eerily prophetic: it will require the act of some lunatic in Tasmania to realise that all this has to be revisited. He was absolutely right. We should have had national agreement on firearms in 1988. It would have been a pretty good bicentennial present to the nation. Eight years have now passed with many lives lost.

         We need to understand why guns are so essential to a significant number of men. It seems to be part of defining masculinity. Why is it that some men feel weak, impotent, unhappy and threatened without guns? We really need to know—and so do they. Masculinity is not under threat, but it needs to be redefined and talked about openly. There is much concern that, with the increased recognition of the rights and opportunities for women professionally, males feel threatened. The phenomenon of the `angry white male' is becoming a political reality. This is by no means confined to Australia; it is true of North America and in much of Europe as well.

Reject the old rhetoric of division and threat.' If the gun lobby want to run candidates, let them. That is their democratic right. I certainly hope the gun control issue can be resolved peacefully.

         —The appalling massacre of 35 Australians at Port Arthur naturally created widespread community dismay, and demands for a much tougher approach to gun ownership soon followed. As a consequence, at a meeting of federal and state ministers in Canberra on 10 May agreement was reached to implement the toughest gun laws our nation has ever known. The new laws are very severe. The new licensing requirements will create inconvenience for thousands of innocent gun owners who have purchased their firearms for legitimate purposes and have always used them carefully.

        The new laws will substantially increase bureaucracy and impose rigorous new procedures at a time when the government is actively pursuing reduction in business regulation and seeking to slash paperwork.

There is, however, strong public support, particularly in the capital cities, for the government's position. The Prime Minister has appointed a government committee to work through the details of the agreed new arrangements in an endeavour to ensure that the impact of the new regulations is fair, equitable and justifiable.

        A recent American study suggested that children between the ages of two and five years watch over 27 hours of television per week. By the time children in the United States become high school seniors, they will have spent approximately 14,000 hours in school and 20,000 hours viewing television programs. Another study has reported that there are, on average, five violent acts per hour during prime time programming on television. This means that children are likely to have watched 100,000 acts of violence on television, including 8,000 murders, by the time they have finished primary school. A large study of teenage boys in London in 1978 showed that those who watched above average hours of television violence were responsible for almost 50 per cent more serious acts of violence than those who viewed below average quantities.

We all accept that the $500 million estimate of the cost of compensation is very much a stab in the dark but we also expect—reasonably I believe—that it will be the end of the need for the special raising of revenue for that purpose.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Medicare levy is to increase by 0.2 per cent from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent of gross income. Members of the defence forces who are currently exempt from the Medicare levy will pay only the increment of 0.2 per cent. All this is important because all Australians need to shoulder the cost of reducing the number of guns in our community. Most accept that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is arguable but on the whole I agree that the Medicare levy will be the most equitable and efficient means of raising the $500 million required. It is interesting to note that in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, according to the most recent budget papers, the Medicare levy will raise a total of $3.6 billion. As such it will contribute to overall Medicare outlays—which for 1995&amp;hyphen;96 are $11.34 billion—and a total health budget throughout the nation in the vicinity of $18.42 billion.

         I want to interject a view into the debate—after all, it concerns the adjustment of the Medicare levy—and ask the question: isn't it time that transparency in the overall cost of Medicare was introduced? Shouldn't taxpayers know their real contribution to the Medicare bill? The Medicare levy, in my opinion, should reflect the true cost of Medicare outlays. At present, only 31.7 per cent of Medicare outlays are actually covered by the levy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my very strong view, the Medicare levy should be increased to reflect the real cost of Medicare outlays and income taxes and the rates that govern them should be cut accordingly to offset the increase in Medicare levies so there is no overall increase in the total tax take. That might appear to be picking at the edges, but it is important, in my opinion, that taxpayers be aware of how much of their hard&amp;hyphen;earned dollars go towards paying the Medicare bill and the total health costs of this nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Much the same situation occurs in the United Kingdom where taxpayers pay their nine per cent national insurance contribution to meet the cost of welfare pensions and the medical system. If taxpayers are to make decisions about who they will vote for in elections in terms of health policy and tax policy, they should have the knowledge of where their taxes are going. Increasing the Medicare levy to reflect the real cost of Medicare would provide such important data and the necessary transparency of which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) makes such a virtue in another context.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Having said that, I want to get back to what the Prime Minister had to say. In his second reading speech he made it clear that gun control in Australia is essentially a matter for state and territory governments. Nevertheless, it is a matter of such national interest that the Commonwealth is prepared to offer this financial assistance to the states and territories to make certain gun control reform is a possibility and is realised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The determination of the Prime Minister and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to enact tighter gun control measures is therefore unequivocally highly commendable. They
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          have not only made the correct decision but they have also stood firm against the lunacy of some extremists in the gun lobby. Some members of that lobby have been spreading misinformation far and wide. The honourable member for Lalor and others touched upon that in their remarks. They, and we, should do what we can to counteract the lies being perpetrated by that extremist—or ill&amp;hyphen;informed—minority of the Australian population.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The more radical elements within the gun lobby are, in my view, quite clearly un&amp;hyphen;Australian. They believe they have the right to bear arms. They do not. The right to bear arms is largely the importation of an American ideal—or idea, I am not sure which—spread far and wide by the US National Rifle Association. We do not need the importation of American ideas and concepts any more than we need the importation of American semiautomatic or military weapons which have never had any cultural tradition here.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also do not want to see the spread of the American gun culture in this great country of ours. The end result of such a development would be, inevitably, more violence in our streets, more Port Arthurs, more Hoddle Streets, more Strathfields and more Queen Streets. So the list goes on. We must—and I am pleased to see that we are acting now—put a stop to the madness. But, as has already been said by others, what is proposed is not a guarantee that Hoddle Street or Port Arthur—or even for that matter a Dunblane—cannot happen again in this country. It is not an end in itself, but a contribution to minimising the possibility of isolated cases of mass murder. Other factors need examination in the cases of the mayhem of an unstable few in our community.

         I have no qualifications in supporting this bill and I am pretty sure I will not have any in supporting any subsequent bill to the extent that it deals with gun control in the context announced by the Prime Minister and the government. I am pleased to see that all parties in the parliament support it, including my Independent colleagues, as far as I am aware. So it is pleasing to see that all state and territory governments supporting the need

         I want to touch on something that has been dealt with comprehensively by previous speakers. It is to query—because I put it no higher than that—the role of the media and how it might contribute to the minimisation of mass murder, which gun controls will undoubtedly do. I do not pretend to know all the answers. No-one would. As someone who is conscientiously opposed to censorship in any of its forms I have a real conflict in my mind. It is the conflict we all get when we start to think about moral issues and talk about passing laws based on moral issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I repeat: I do not pretend to know the answers. But let me say this without qualification: anyone who has read a book and got an idea from that book cannot doubt the importance of the printed word. Books and the printed word were once the repository of ideas. Now to add to that single dimension is film, including television, in its various forms. In many ways, because of the impression it can create on the young, it is arguably more important. I liked a reference I read. Unfortunately I cannot remember who is responsible so I will not go to the trouble of not attributing someone else's idea.

         The comment of someone in the advertising business or media generally was that if people wanting to sell a product out there decide to spend X million dollars to promote a product on television, you can be damned sure they are not doing it to waste their money. The fact that they can do that on television would indicate to me and to any reasonable person that there is at least some case for looking at what is shown on television—and I do not mean only in prime time, as the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) qualified his remarks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So it is a terribly difficult proposition for me because you are looking at the possibility of balancing censorship of the vast, almost total, majority and acts of unpredictable behaviour by a mentally unstable few. Unfortunately there are circumstances—Port Arthur demonstrates it and so do the other infamous cases to which I and others have referred earlier in the debate—which force you to the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          conclusion that the importance of the media cannot be ignored. I found it distasteful, and in my judgment—without intrinsic or other evidence to support my view—the media, particularly the printed media, spent too much time in what I would describe as wallowing in the events of Port Arthur.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have absolutely no argument, but some reservations, about the media reporting diabolical events such as that. But to make a feature of it day after day and to give six&amp;hyphen;page spreads in practically every newspaper in this country makes me wonder what that tiny, unstable few might think about that and how it might influence their behaviour. I have absolutely no evidence for reaching a conclusion that people might be influenced by those events. But my life's experience, for what it's worth, suggests to me that they could not fail to be. If these guys think that 15 minutes is all they are allocated in their lifetime to achieve fame, that might be all they need. And there is enough anecdotal if not intrinsic evidence to suggest that there may be some basis for that belief.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, all that aside, I conclude by saying it is only due to the shock of Port Arthur and the resolve of the Prime Minister and his government, and his Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, that these reforms are now becoming a reality. I am grateful for the support that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the opposition party have been able to afford that. I should observe that it is a matter to me—and I am sure to most people—of profound regret that so many people had to die for tighter gun controls to be properly addressed.

         —I do not want to prolong the debate on this subject. I would have happily not spoken on it were it not for the fact that it was brought home with some brutality in my own backyard, so to speak, only last week. A gun lobby rally was held in my electorate, which also happens to fall into the state electorate of the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Rob Borbidge, which was addressed by a number of people including certain state and federal members of parliament.

I therefore will accept absolutely no criticism from the gun lobby along the lines of a lack of interest in the subject and I shall certainly accept no criticism from the gun lobby when the rally which the citizens of the Gold Coast are organising for 14 July does not invite certain other people to it.

        But I will invite the so&amp;hyphen;called silent majority for once in their life to give two hours of their life to something they claim they believe in very strongly. On 14 July an organisation which has been put together fairly hastily, because we never anticipated we would need to do it, will hold a rally which will involve all political parties and quite a number of community organisations. I want to pay tribute to the National Party of Australia, the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens on the Gold Coast who have very promptly responded. It is not my intention to engage in any exercise of self&amp;hyphen;promotion through this rally. I will not speak. Nowhere will my name appear. But these people have, on faith, accepted my assurance and will come along and put their shoulders to the wheel to try to do something in which they believe. That, to me, is an absolutely unique experience in politics, that people of very different political persuasions can be brought together. People who only three months ago were going at one another tooth and nail will come together in goodwill and in faith on an issue. Why?

        I am not an expert on all these types of guns that people are talking about but I have had in my life my own particular experience of guns. There was a time when I used to keep company with people who did enjoy guns and who shot at things. Just for fun one time, because I was invited to, I took a rifle and shot at something. I found I had a small amount of skill. Thereafter I used to do the target practice things that one does for fun. I did not take it very seriously and I used to

        One day, on one of these excursions, we came upon some ducks on a dam. Because I happened to have a rifle in my hand, one of my companions said, `Why don't you aim at one of them?' So I did, and I shot it. I will never forget the feeling of revulsion that swept through me as I said to myself, `Why did I do that? Why did I shoot that duck? It was not doing anything to me. It was perfectly happy with its companions on the dam, and I killed it.' The explanation is that, in an instant, that rifle became not something which gave me some entertainment; it became something that killed. That is the great divide on rifles. It is the great divide, I believe, between men and women and their attitudes on this issue.

        There was a time when people needed to hunt in this country. It was not so long ago in some cases when shooting duck or rabbit was how the family ate. We are not so many generations removed from that. If people needed to shoot a wild animal in order to eat, then I could understand it. But I think there are precious few people in Australia today who need to do that.

        I understand the need to shoot feral pigs, deer and kangaroos under certain circumstances for particular reasons, but I do not understand the need to kill for the sake of killing. That may be because I am a woman. That may be because I do not have the hunter's instinct. I know that a lot of men do, and they see nothing wrong with it. There is not anything wrong with it per se, but it is not necessary. When stacked up in the debate today in Australia, in the atmosphere and in the light of the events that have brought this particular debate on, there is no contest.

         On the other hand, like a lot of older Australians, I have seen in recent decades a shift in our culture, in the attitude of using weapons and their role in society, and in what we tolerate. We tolerate weapons in what we look at. First of all this was in films and television, and now it is in video games, which I have never seen but have had described to me—and I do not like the sound of them.

         I think the average Australian feels a certain diffidence about expressing their negative feelings on this—the feeling that maybe they are just old fashioned, like me; that maybe there is not any harm in it.

         I appreciate when many people say, `You can't label everybody who wants to have guns without having to register or be answerable and who wants to have as many as they like or whatever type they like, because they are not killers and they do not want to be blamed.' I appreciate their resentment of what they think is a labelling of them. I want to reassure them that it is not a labelling of them. The problem is that you cannot label anybody in this society today as potentially a perpetrator of the acts at Port Arthur.

         That diffidence that we felt that allowed more and more violent films in theatres or on television, which was done with a feeling of goodwill, of live and let live—an Australian characteristic—has gone too far. I have some familiarity with the American culture. My husband is a very proud American, although he is now an Australian citizen. He served his country as member of the United States Marines throughout World War II in the Pacific and again in Korea. He was in the first landing the US Marines made in the Pacific at Guadalcanal. He went through all the horrors of several very well-known marine

         He was recalled against his will by President Truman to go to Korea. He fought in some very bloody and well-known battles there, including the battle of the Hwachon Reservoir, which was a horror—he was taken as a prisoner of war—but he regretted none of that because he was a marine. Marines, by the way, do not call rifles `guns', and neither do their wives. He went through all of that but he has never put his hand on a gun, or a rifle, since the day he left Korea.

         He lived in the United States of America until 1983. He would never have guns or rifles in his home, because he knew them as killing instruments. The only comment he has made to me on this subject was when watching some of the more extremist people on television making some of their outlandish comments. With an edge of quite some bitterness in his voice that I have never heard before, he said, `They've never been ordered to blow someone away.' Keith Payne VC was reported in the newspaper a few weeks ago as saying in relation to the gun lobby, `What they need is some practice in a two-way shooting gallery.'

         Part of the horror of Port Arthur and all the other terrible massacres and mass killings that we have seen happen in this country in the past 10 years is that every one of us can put ourselves in the shoes of those people.

         I want to mention another turning point on guns for me because it links in with that. Until five years ago, I never locked the door of my house so long as my husband was on the premises; and I always lock it now. If he is out in the yard he takes his keys with him because he is locked out as soon as he walks out the door. It is the result of an incident on the  Gold Coast where a middle&amp;hyphen;aged couple was sitting down to lunch one day in their home when a young man walked through

         I think most people feel that they are safe in their own homes in broad daylight. I think most women would feel that if their husbands are around no-one is going to come around. But that was another turning point for me. Whilst it might seem light years away from the Port Arthur incident, nevertheless, it is that terrible instant of understanding that, whilst it might happen 10 kilometres or 2,000 kilometres away, the fact that it happens in Australia today suggests a terrible potential.

         Port Arthur touched a nerve in a lot of people—and not just a nerve of empathy and sympathy. There is a beginning of that undercurrent of fear in Australia. Guns are not part of our normal culture. To be confronted by someone holding a gun or a rifle is something quite foreign to nearly every Australian. The Port Arthur incident somehow brought home to people that it could happen to them. The odds might seem fairly long but it could happen, just as it happened to those poor people who were on holiday, having a pleasant Sunday afternoon, with such ghastly consequences.

         I am sure that all of us have many speeches we would like to make on this subject. There are a couple of things I will get on the record in the small amount of time available. In the course of this debate I came by a publication called

          New Citizen
         </emphasis>
         . This is printed by the Citizens Electoral Council, as I recall it. I am going to seek leave to table a photocopy of the front and back pages of this newspaper. This is put out by an organisation that quite a few of us are familiar with. It runs an extraordinary theory that drugs worldwide are somehow under the control of the British. A gentleman called LaRouche who has been the victim of some awful conspiracy is mentioned throughout this publication. It states that there is a worldwide conspiracy linked in with something funny called a new world order.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This edition mentions an organisation called Mont Pelerin. A number of people whom we know are listed as being involved in organisations which in some vague, shadowy way are linked with this worldwide conspiracy. On the back page under the heading `Mass murder in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Tasmania' there is the subheading `It has the hallmarks of the Tavistock Institute's—another one of these organisations—"blind terror" campaigns'. If you read through the previous 15 pages, you will find that the alleged perpetrator of this massacre—I will not mention him because I think some things are sub judice—is in some strange way an agent of all this, albeit against his will; he  has been brainwashed or manipulated in some way.

         I will table the front and back pages simply so that there is available to people an example of the extremity of it. I have seen this sort of thing arise in other places in Australia. These people move in wherever there is trauma in a society, be it because rural industry is depressed and people are being evicted from their farms as a result of being dead broke or a town is distressed due to an industry being shut down through government policy or whatever. You will find all those issues woven through one of these publications. They move in wherever there is trauma and agitation and simple, ordinary folk are going through some extremity.

         They are now moving in on people who are going to lose their guns or rifles, and they are saying, `Hey, you are a victim of this very simply understood conspiracy.' They give this simple, evil explanation. I have had it occur in my own electorate, as it was then, when an issue arose in relation to a multifunction polis, where government was going to compulsorily take over land and the Japanese were going to come in and build on it. I saw how they operated on good, simple, ordinary, decent Australians. They got all this poison into their minds and then away they went. These people are involved in this. I am not saying that all the people who are demonstrating are part of it, but they are being preyed on. It needs to be revealed. It needs to be something that more Australians know about. Given the interest in Australia on the subject of gun control by so many people at the moment, I hope that they will become familiar with these sorts of organisations.

         —I want to initially put on the record my commendation of those people who have waged a very lonely struggle on this issue of gun control in the past few decades. After the trauma of Port Arthur, the federal parliament of this country and the state premiers have finally moved to do something on this issue.

        But we should put on the record that there have been people who have persisted in trying to get change in this area. There have been academics like Richard Harding and Paul Wilson. There have been the Australian Medical Association and the Bank Employees Union and its membership. There has been former Parramatta city councillor Therese

         Wood, who rang me today about the possibility of organising a demonstration in Parramatta to try to indicate that the broad majority of people in this country have a different view to the more vocal and active minority who are on the front page every week.

        There have been people like Dorothy McRae-McMahon, the Director for Mission of the Uniting Church in Australia, and the Anglican parish of St Peter's at Hornsby, which sent votergrams today. And there has been Ivan, a friend and party member in my area, who is better known as Brad Gibson. He had an untimely death last Friday evening, but he joined my party through contact with me and my own persistent activity on this issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There have been people out there who did not need the events at Milperra, Strathfield Plaza, Queen Street, Hoddle Street or Port Arthur to say that change had to occur. When the congratulations are going to the leaders of the major political parties, it should be borne in mind that when there was a lack of courage in this country amongst a variety of political leaders some people said that there was an urgent need for change.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Early today I cited a few public opinion polls to drive home the reality that the mass of Australians are not affected by emotions; they are not turned around by just one traumatic event. I want to make a correction in relation to a poll held in September 1995. It was not a statewide poll; it was a plebiscite of residents of North Sydney council and there was 93 per cent support for a gun register. A 1978 Morgan poll, which I did not cite earlier today, showed that 88.8 per cent were for the registration of shotguns and .22 rifles and that 8.1 per cent were against it. Last year in New South Wales—before the Port Arthur massacre—82 per cent wanted stronger gun laws.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the point that has to be reiterated is that what is happening today is not totally an emotional outburst of a thoughtless and mindless need for restrictions. It is a long and sustained view of the Australian electorate that the possession of arms by so many people, the lack of restrictions, the lack of registration and the lack of controls are essentially a bad thing for this country.

        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the points that is important is the interrelationship of gun availability and the number of offences. It is worth noting the Australian Social Trends 1994 document
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Youth Suicide
         </emphasis>
         . From 1987 to 1991 it was noted that there was a very big difference in the number of deaths with guns in urban and rural areas. In the urban area only 18 per cent of deaths occurred through guns; in rural areas the figure was 42 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note the clear point—we all know this—that large urban areas create crime, that the social problems in those areas lead to a far greater incidence of offences per head of population. But in regard to the ratio of gun homicides in rural and urban areas in this country, the rate in rural areas is 13.5 per cent as against the urban figure of 13.6 per cent. Over the last 15 years there has been a 50 per cent increase in male deaths by suicide. The point is that, as I say, there is a correlation between the greater prevalence of guns in rural areas and the inclination to suicide by firearm. This is one of the few offences where the rate is commensurate with city areas. There is a clear message there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Seitz, in an article in the United States, made this same point. He looked at the levels of gun ownership in different regions of the United States. In the south there was a rate of 59 to 100,000. In the north-east of the United States the rate was 33. Quite clearly, it was not coincidental that the number of accidental deaths was 2.46 to 100,000 in the south and 0.59 in the north-east. In other words, the prevalence of accidental deaths from firearms is a little under five times greater in the south, which is clearly interrelated with the greater levels of gun ownership. Also, FBI figures from 1991 showed a 15 per cent greater incidence of gun homicides in the south. Despite certain people's objections that there is no interrelationship, there is a very clear connection between the availability of arms and a number of offences.

         Earlier today I referred to articles by Kellermann, a United States writer in this area. I refer to a further article titled `Suicide in the home in relation to gun ownership' from the

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         From 1968 through 1985, the rate of suicide involving firearms increased 36 percent, whereas the rate of suicide involving other methods remained constant.9 Among adolescents and youth adults, rates of suicide by firearms doubled during the same period.

         Univariate analyses revealed that the case subjects were more likely than the controls to have lived alone, taken prescribed psychotropic medication, been arrested, abused drugs or alcohol, or not graduated from high school. After we controlled for these characteristics through conditional logistic regression, the presence of one or more guns in the home was found to be associated with an increased rate of suicide . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         Furthermore, in the same article—as I say, it is an analysis of suicides in the United States—he made the telling point:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         To the question "Many people occasionally have quarrels or fights—has anyone in this household ever been hit or hurt in a fight in the home?" 13.6 percent of the case proxies answered in the affirmative, but only 3.9 percent of controls. The combination of alcohol and domestic violence was particularly striking. Almost 15 percent of case proxies reported physical fights while drinking, as compared with only 1.2 percent of matched controls.
        </para>
        <para>
         The article also states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Handguns were used in 72 percent of the suicides involving a firearm. In four of every five such suicides, the investigators specifically noted that the gun had been kept in the victim's home.

        </para>
        <para style="Other">
         In homes where firearms were not usually kept, only 6 percent of case subjects killed themselves with a gun. The last 172 case proxies to be interviewed were asked how long a gun had been kept in the victim's home. Only 5 of the 162 who answered (3 per cent) reported that the gun had been obtained within two weeks of the suicide.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, there is clearly a connection between the availability of guns and the prevalence of gun homicides, accidental deaths, et cetera. As we all know and many speakers have said earlier, most of these deaths occur not through the type of person the gun lobby says will always get guns—the professional criminal. We all know that those people will obtain them. Most people are killed by relations, by neighbours, by people with whom they have a close association. Kellermann further said:

        <break page="2029" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Since both living alone and taking psychotropic medication were strongly associated with suicide but negatively correlated with gun ownership, controlling for their effects increased the apparent strength of the association between suicide and the presence of a gun in the home.

         <para>

         <para>
          It is one of the great myths of the gun lobby that we have all these guns around the house so that we can shoot the head off the burglar when he breaks in. The reality is that we are usually half asleep, hungover or whatever, and have no chance whatsoever to get hold of the gun—because of the element of surprise. As I said in an earlier debate, Kellermann noted:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          For every case of self&amp;hyphen;protection homicide involving a firearm kept in the home, there were 1.3 accidental deaths, 4.6 criminal homicides and 37 suicides involving firearms—an overall ratio of 43:1.
         </para>
         <para>
          For each burglar you might happen to shoot, 43 people manage to shoot themselves or members of their family. They are not very good odds. Another study he undertook was a comparison in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 of similar demographic households. There were 3:1 odds that, regardless of how similar these people were—whether blacks, unemployed, Hispanics, autoworkers—when all those things were held even, where a homicide was involved a gun was on the premises. Despite the denials, the reality is that there is a correlation between the availability of guns and the possibility that people will accidentally shoot themselves, and a correlation with a higher rate of suicide.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the problems in this country has been that the lack of political leadership and a lack of willingness to tackle this problem have led to the proliferation of guns, not in any manner like the level in the United States but certainly at a far more worrying level than in the United Kingdom or Japan. That again is a problem because we have increasing numbers of people with a vested interest in the possession of guns and in opposing licensing and restrictions. As each year has dragged on and as each massacre has failed to move the politicians in this country, there have been more and more people with a determined self&amp;hyphen;interest in opposing change.

We have to really question whether we want a society like that cited in the US News and World Report of 15 August 1994, which indicated that 37 per cent of Americans had heard a gunshot in their neighbourhood. If we want any demonstration of the political reality we can look to the United States where only 42 per cent of people in 1994 supported any kind of mandatory training; only 47 per cent said that possessing a gun creates more problems than it solves; and 22 per cent of the population said that it was quite reasonable for people to carry concealed weapons.

          The valuable time that has been lost on this issue has made the task politically far more difficult. We are seeing the kinds of pressures that particularly members in country areas are coming under because there is a connection between the gun lobby's interest in the matter and their determination to stop change.

Barry Jones said, `There is no Liberal, Labor, National, Democrat or Green position on this matter; there is a human position which is represented and reflected by the concern which representatives of all those political parties—and the political parties themselves, collectively—have adopted on this question. Most people have drawn attention to the fact that, in a very real way, it is a sorry reflection on members of parliament and on parliaments in Australia generally that it took a tragedy of the dimensions of that which occurred at Port Arthur for governments to steel themselves finally into doing something positive and firm about it.

         One can only speculate about the horror and fear, the feelings, the emotions had by those people at Port Arthur and others in circumstances of a similar kind over the years. I do not think anyone will forget the circumstances at Port Arthur where, for example, a mother holding her child, in the face of an approach by the gunman, appealed to him not to shoot the child and having the child killed and having herself killed; and another child, after seeing members of the family shot, attempting to hide behind a tree and, in turn, being shot. The point has been made that, in the absence of automatic and semiautomatic weapons, a massacre of that dimension simply would not and could not have occurred.

         Like all those who have spoken, I am delighted that members of parliament who have been subjected to quite justified criticism for many years for failing to act decisively in connection with this question have now chosen to act collectively. I saw, as most others did, either directly or indirectly, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) just last weekend address a hostile group of people in Victoria and make it perfectly clear that there would be no retreat. Let me say that members of the National Party, in particular, should take credit for the fact that they have been prepared to withstand the threats and intimidation which have been visited upon them in one way or another in their determination to join with others to ensure that effective legislation be put into place.

          I know that others have referred to this, but I also think it important that we place on record an outline of those more recent occasions where firearms have been used in quite horrendous circumstances to cause multiple deaths. September 6, 1971: Clifford Bartholemew killed 10 people at Hope Forest near Adelaide. September 2, 1984: seven people were killed in the car park of the Viking Tavern at Milperra, Sydney. January 23, 1987: Richard Madrell killed four teenage girls at West Pymble. June 1987: Joseph Schwab with a Rugar .223 semiautomatic rifle killed five people in a five&amp;hyphen;day period in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. August 9, 1987: Julian Knight killed seven and wounded 19 on Hoddle Street, Mel bourne. October 11, 1987: John van Trung Tran killed five people in Canley Vale, Sydney. December 8, 1987: Frank Vitkovic killed eight and wounded 10 in Queen Street, Melbourne. April 7, 1990: Rodney Dale killed one and wounded 13 at Burleigh Heads in New South Wales. August 30, 1990: Paul Anthony Evers killed five people in Surry Hills, Sydney, with a shotgun. August 17, 1991: Wade Frankum killed seven people and wounded seven others in Strathfield, Sydney. March 28 to 30, 1993: Leonard Leabeater and two accomplices shot dead five people in northern New South Wales. And, of course, there have been those terrible circumstances at Dunblane—another event of recent occurrence. These events have caused anguish and despair on the part of so many people but, at the same time, they have caused members of parliament and governments to become even more determined that something be done about them.

         I want to mention in particular just a couple of comparative statistics which, at least prima facie, indicate the enormous additional dangers associated with the number of firearms compared with the populations of various countries. In 1994, the United States, for example, having about 250 million people, had over 39,000 deaths in one year resulting from the use of firearms. That was 40,000 deaths in one year. In Britain and Japan gun laws are much more effective and much more stringent. In Britain, with 57 million people, there were 70 gun deaths. In Japan, with 124 million people, there were 34 gun deaths. The comparison there is more than apparent. It indicates, prima facie, the additional potential for tragedies of the kind that have recently occurred.

          In Australia, there is an official figure of 1.67 million registered weapons. Estimates of the number of guns in civilian hands in Australia vary from between 3.5 million and 10 million. We have all been aware of the fact that those gun shops act as conveyor belts flooding weapons of that kind into the community. If they were not selling them, they would not continue to operate. We see them full of guns. Those guns continue to flow into the community. The more civil and civilised people within the community are those who have acknowledged the reality of that and they realise that that problem exists.

           —This debate has seen speakers range wide and far. I just want to make a few comments about this discussion. Most people in the community listening to this debate would not recognise it as the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill because people have been mainly talking about the proposal dealing with guns. One of the great things about this debate is that there has been a multipartisan approach. All the parties in this country have given a strong affirmation to the leadership given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and premiers around this country. This also illustrates the point that there has been a very strong cooperative approach between the states and the Commonwealth in regard to this debate.

          It is quite unusual that we have a multipartisan approach to a debate and also have the cooperation of the state leaders. That is very important in this debate because it gives strength and weight to the position which has been adopted since the Port Arthur tragedy, which occurred just over six or eight weeks ago.

           That tragedy has brought about a step change in consciousness in the Australian people with regard to violence. The most important thing is that we now see a strengthened will, not only at the parliamentary level but also at the community level to have a clear focus on reducing violence in this country. That is a very good thing. I think the overwhelming majority of Australians feel that the level of violence that has gradually developed in our society is very unhealthy. The step change in consciousness on this issue of violence I liken very much to the step change in consciousness that surrounded environmental issues during the 1980s. In the mid&amp;hyphen;1990s we have a step change in the consciousness within our community with regard to violence.

            —I would like to make a few more comments at this stage. The Prime Minister clearly has a multifaceted approach to dealing with this issue of violence. He is not just dealing with guns but also, with his committee, looking into violence in regard to the media, videos, CD lyrics, TV, cinema and so on. It is all part of trying to reduce the level of violence which is in our community. So it is a multifaceted approach, and people within the pro&amp;hyphen;gun lobby have to realise that they are not the only people to which we as a government are looking to try to reduce violence within our community, that there is a multifaceted approach by the government to try to deal with the level of violence.

           As I was saying a few moments ago, I believe the step change in consciousness within the Australian community does require a multifaceted approach by the government. I believe that it is very important that we as a parliament are resolved to ensure that the approaches adopted will actually be achieved and, therefore, will break this culture of violence which has developed within the Australian society. In that respect, I commend this bill to the House.

        It was a time in Australia when I was not proud to be an Australian because every politician and every journalist in this country knew there was not one thread of a threat to Australia emanating from those tests. When the question was put they said it was not a threat; it was simply that France could not do what it liked in our part of the world. Of course, Mururoa has been French longer than Australia has been ours. If you reduce France's sovereign rights you reduce your own rights by the same amount.

        The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), having done this sordid little trick to capture, as he thought, the environmental vote, when the opportunity arose again little Johnny jumped up again. This time it was to prepare the ground for the double dissolution which he intended to have this year. The gullible Labor Party followed down that track. They must have realised that they would have been decimated in even more seats if that had been allowed to occur. That will not occur now, but it is certainly not as a result of any ability on the part of the Labor Party.

        I have been sitting here tonight and listening to the trotting out of a lot of meaningless statistics. The facts are simple. Since 1915 when records were first kept, gun related violence has been trending down in Australia, unlike the United States where it is trending up at about three times the Australian rate. It is true that in some parts of the United States it is low. Where it is high it is always associated with socioethnic violence and crime. That is the main cause of it.

         In 1994, the last year that statistics were kept, 400 men committed suicide, 21 using guns. We should be addressing the cause of those suicides. That is not suggested any where. If they cannot use guns they will obviously use something else, as they do elsewhere. Sweden, Switzerland and Japan all have much higher suicide rates than Australia and they do not use guns. If people want to do away with themselves they will.

        The reasons for those suicides were simple. Economic pressure in the rural sector was a big cause. There were the failings of the Family Law Court and the inequities of the child support laws. These will not be investigated because this requires real courage on the part of a government—something that I see neither on the other side nor on this side. They are just the simple facts of the situation. In the same year, 400 men died of suicide and, I think it was, 58 men and 26 women died from armed assaults. This shows that suicide is by far the biggest factor and is not being tackled, nor will it be tackled.

So our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) received the grateful thanks of Australians when he provided the leadership which resulted in minimum conditions for safer gun laws throughout Australia.

        So, as part of this final discussion, I believe the country really does have a great need to look carefully at the compensation issues. We have made a major move today to amend the Medicare levy act. We are saying that in a one&amp;hyphen;off situation half a billion dollars will be raised to be redistributed to the lawful population of Australia who will be disadvantaged. The armed forces will also be included in this measure. So tonight I commend the Prime Minister who has taken a statesmanlike approach in identifying the minimum standards and conditions for firearms control. It is now over to the states to pass the regulations. At the federal level he has also ensured that the law&amp;hyphen;abiding community of Australians, who overwhelmingly in regional areas are also gun owners, will be fully compensated. It is essential that this compensation be paid fairly and effectively.

        The majority of members would be aware that the Marconi Club, apart from being famous for its community service, is prominent in Australian sporting circles via its excellent and continuing contribution to Australian soccer. On 13 June, the Chairman of the Marconi Fairfield soccer team, Mr Frank Baroni, received a fax from the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Soccer Federation, Mr David Woolley, outlining the terms and conditions to be met by Marconi
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Fairfield if it is to be included as a participant in the 1996-97 Ericsson Cup season. After making several reasonable requests of Club Marconi, Mr Woolley then went straight for the jugular. He wrote:

        . . . as part of a National Merchandising Plan programmed to commence with the 1996/97 season, all clubs shall be obliged to remove all symbols of European nationalism from club logos, playing strips, club flags, stadium names and letterheads.
       </para>
       <para>
        This translates to a demand that, after 36 years of serving the nation, the Marconi Club's soccer team must not only remove the inoffensive club insignia from its players' uniforms and merchandising but, worst of all, it must change its name because it supposedly pays too candid a nod to its European roots. The price Marconi will pay for failure to adhere to the federation's demands is exclusion from competition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So what we have here is a veiled threat of blackmail from the Australian Soccer Federation. They are saying, `Do it, or else.' They are telling that to the thousands of Club Marconi members and the even greater numbers of Australians who support the club's soccer teams—which, incidentally, finished as winners in the junior competition and runners up in the senior competition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us take a look at the symbol, and I have brought it into the House so all can see it. Let us take a look at how supposedly nationalistic it really is. The Marconi symbol is a boomerang striped in red, green and white on a globe of the world with a communications tower. It symbolises the people's hope and trust in travelling to their new country, Australia. It symbolises the confidence that led the club's founders to abandon their previous lives and take their chances in a foreign country, which has given so much to them and to which they have endeavoured to repay.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        And the name that they have to remove? Guglielmo Marconi's name graces the club and its soccer team because he too had strong links with Australia. On 26 March 1930, Marconi, as he sat on board his boat in the harbour at Genoa, pushed a button which lit the lights of Sydney Town Hall 11,000 miles away—an amazing feat for that time. Again, his name can be seen as symbolising the link
        <break page="2036" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         between one country and another, the connection between the old and the new. The Italians who founded the club were Club Marconi's spark, but the energy is now provided by thousands from all different walks of life.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Marconi's name and insignia are not a blind idolatry of a foreign European past. The club's beginnings were undeniably Italian, but now its membership crosses all ethnic boundaries. In one of Australia's most multicultural centres, Marconi's prosperity stands as a symbol of its continued success in appealing to all sections of our society, not just the Italian. The demands placed on Marconi by the Australian Soccer Federation in relation to its name and symbol are either a poorly thought out exercise in political correctness or a vindictive attempt by the federation, led by David Hill, to subject the club to the pettiness and the whims of its officials.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I ask Mr Hill and Mr Woolley: which is it? Will you recognise the errors of your way in making this request of Club Marconi or will you proceed with this campaign based on spite against a successful club and teams which have enriched the lives of thousands of Australians?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the Australian Soccer Federation does proceed in pressing for these ludicrous demands to be met, then you can be sure that Club Marconi and the people of western Sydney will fight Mr Hill all the way. Nor will they ever forgive him for the animosity he has shown and the rancorous fashion in which he has pursued and attempted to discredit this bastion of the west.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When Club Marconi's founders came together, led by Michelini, they had a vision, and I would like to put their vision on the record of this place. It was to have a place, equal to any other part of the land, where they and their families could come and enjoy themselves, a place where they could not only be proud of their heritage but also appreciate a nation which allowed them the opportunity to work to create a home and a future for themselves, their families and their friends. Their vision is now a reality and has been shared by countless other Australians since our club was founded in 1958.

         Mr Hill will tell you that I have a particular interest in this club. That is correct. I have been a member since 1959 and I was the first woman named a life member of this club. But I say to Mr Hill and to the Soccer Federation that if they take these steps and take the matter further in blackmailing Club Marconi by saying that they will be removed from the Soccer Federation unless they remove their name from their symbols and their letterhead, I too will go to the racial discrimination board. I believe that what they are doing is not only blackmail but racial discrimination.

         As a country which can be so proud of what it has achieved in these past 200 years with its ethnic population, how can we then turn around and say to a club, which for 36 years has made such a wonderful contribution not only to the community but, as I have said before, to soccer and to young people in our area, that it has to front up without the name `Marconi' or get out of the league?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I questioned what else they were upset about, it was the fact that the boomerang which we so cleverly designed to go on the map of the world has—dreadful, dreadful!—the colours of the Marconi flag: red, green and white. If that has got to be removed, South Sydney's football colours, which are the same, should be removed as well.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What is most enlightening to all of us is that he and maybe one other person in this entire House, on both sides of the parliament, spruik the same message that he has been spreading, which means that we have something like 146 to two in this place, which is pretty much representative of this debate in Australia. Unfortunately, those two seem to be very noisy but have very little to say.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the record, I would like to clear up why this legislation has been brought in. It is John Howard, the Prime Minister—not `Little
        <break page="2037" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Johnny', as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie likes to refer to him in his typically arrogant manner—who has demonstrated leadership and shown the rest of Australia what is necessary to make Australia a safer place.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This legislation is not designed so that the gun owner, the person who likes to go shooting at the weekend or any other member of the public is going to be disarmed. It is designed for that unfortunate set of circumstances when a person who is deranged at a moment in time and has had no prior mental illness has the motivation, the depression and quite often the alcohol or some other substance on board and then has access to the weapon with which he is able to carry out such mass destruction.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Legislating so that people can have semiautomatic rifles registered and so that the person owning them can be registered is absolutely pointless because, as the member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, the gentleman who carried out the Hoddle Street massacre—and I use the term `gentleman' rather liberally—and the man who was responsible for the Port Arthur massacre did not own the weapons but secured them from a third party. Therefore, if we had bothered to legislate to have those rifles not banned but owned legally, those men still would have had access to the semiautomatic rifle which created this carnage and we would still have ended up with as many dead people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is about time the member for Kalgoorlie and one or two other members of this place who take delight in going around this country inciting people unnecessarily, forcing upon them mis&amp;hyphen;truths and misrepresentations about the resolutions of the police meeting, did themselves a lot of good and sat back, pulled their heads in and had a good, long think about what they are doing. They are the ones that are being destructive; they are the ones that are taking away the leadership in this nation. If they, just for once, took a good look at themselves, looked at the good of the nation and then presented logical arguments, this would be a much better place in which to do business.

         I met members of the Sporting Shooters Association in my area and spent an hour with them. At the end of that meeting, they concluded that they were quite happy with the way they see things going. It is only the loony fringe, not the mainstream gun or shooters elements—that very small percentage of the population—that is disturbed by what is going on. It is using this for its own political means, not because it is concerned about the rights of Australians or their ability to defend themselves; those rights have not been undermined.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I hope that the one or two people who continue to rave on in this lunatic fashion refrain from doing so in future and look at what the Prime Minister has put up and see that it has been and will continue to be supported by the overwhelming majority of the Australian public. If we get this legislation approved by the states in the form proposed, this country will be a safer place. People will be able to go forward into the future feeling that Australia will not go down the path of the United States. That can only make our country a better place to live in.

         —I take this opportunity to place on record a few comments on the tragic incident last Wednesday evening in Townsville where two Black Hawk helicopters collided during an exercise, causing the loss of 18 service personnel lives. On Wednesday night, we lost 18 of the finest Australians in the service: 15 Special Air Service Regiment troopers and three from the 5 Aviation Regiment involved in crewing the Black Hawk helicopters. These people stretch the limits of physical and emotional endurance as part of their regular training. That they should lose their lives in exercises designed to provide security for the rest of us is a matter of grave concern for all of us. It is, though, above all else a personal tragedy for the families and the loved ones of those who died and those who remain injured. I believe that three are still in critical care.

         who in the normal course of their work place their lives in jeopardy should die on an exercise designed to ensure that those of us in the wider community are able to exercise our freedoms without threat to life and property. That grief, which has been so evident around the Australian community and which was exhibited earlier today in the memorial service here in Canberra, may provide some comfort to those closest to the victims.

        I want in the few short moments available to me tonight to also place on record my admiration for the bravery of those people who were at the site. When the two helicopters collided, miraculously the pilot of the second helicopter managed to get that helicopter to ground upright without a tail rotor or a good part of its tail. That demonstrated an enormous amount of skill under the most unimaginable sorts of pressures. At the time the helicopters were something like 50 metres above the ground. You can contemplate the time in which those events transpired. Without the skill of Captain Burke I fear that the death toll would have been worse.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bravery at the site at the time of the crash is also worthy of mention. Troops, including safety officers, were on the ground as part of the exercise. Other helicopters that were in the air as part of the exercises came to the rescue. The first helicopter burst into flames on impact, and the second burst into flames shortly thereafter. There was live ammunition on both. It was a live exercise of the sort the SAS is used to conducting. Those people involved in the rescue were not just in a burning environment but in one where live shells were going off everywhere. The dedication, skill, bravery and sheer heroism that those people on the ground displayed should make all Australians proud of our defence forces.

       (b) Regional Council elections are held each three years. They are run by the Australian Electoral Commission. Voting is by secret ballot and is not compulsory. The proportional representation system of voting is used. This assists smaller communities to obtain a representative on Regional Councils. After declaration of the polls for Regional Councillors, elections are then held for the position of Commissioner within each Zone. The Minister then formally appoints the elected person to be a Commissioner.

       (7) Voting is not compulsory for eligible voters at ATSIC elections. One reason for this is that there is no register of eligible voters for ATSIC elections. It is therefore impossible to identify non&amp;hyphen;compliance. To be eligible to vote, a person must live in the ward concerned, be on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, and be an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander. The Commonwealth Electoral Roll includes no provision to identify people by race. People wishing to vote have their eligibility verified at the polling booth.

       An independent review of ATSIC's electoral systems was conducted following the last round of Regional Council elections under the provisions of Division 9 of Part 3 of the ATSIC Act. The review involved widespread community consultation. One of the recommendations from that review was to establish a register of eligible voters for ATSIC elections. However, it was not feasible for such a register to be introduced for the 1996 elections. Nevertheless, the Review Panel recommended that voting in ATSIC elections should remain non&amp;hyphen;

        compulsory. If compulsory voting was imposed, then there would have to be a penalty for not voting and an intention to impose this. There would be considerable effort and costs involved in the follow up action necessary. It was considered that, rather than devoting additional resources to measures which force people to vote under the threat of a penalty for non&amp;hyphen;compliance, more value could be obtained by better educating the community in relation to the power of their vote.

These include specialist hardcopy Buyers Guides, dedicated telephone support, personal visits by Customer Service Representatives, training programs, and greater involvement by departments in the establishment of some arrangements. A significant enhancement has been the introduction of electronic information through CD-ROM which has improved user acceptance and awareness. The requirement for Government departments to provide reasons for not using common use arrangements to the National Procurement Board has also enhanced the awareness and

       (1)&amp;hyphen;(5) I announced the proposed transfer on 8 March 1996 and the Governor-General signed the Administrative Arrangements Order giving effect to it on 11 March 1996. The functions, staff and resources of the Office were transferred in toto for the remainder of 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Funding arrangements in respect of future years are to be considered as part of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 Budget process. This in no sense represents a retreat from previous commitments. Indeed, the transfer has opened up new opportunities for furthering the multicultural agenda. New synergies will be created, better coordination of functions will result and there will be greater opportunities to share knowledge and expertise. There will be no duplication of work between my Department and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Multicultural affairs will benefit from the increased support available through the overall resources of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Although the Minister is not a Cabinet Minister he will, of course, be co-opted to attend Cabinet meetings when matters relating to his responsibilities are being considered.

       (6) The issues raised in the charter letters are a matter between the Minister and me. I would, however, expect the Minister to have due regard for the importance of multicultural issues and ensure that they are a distinctive yet unifying force in Australia. As well, there are a range of initiatives to which the Government is committed. A Federal Access and Equity Strategy will be implemented, in cooperation with the States and Territories, and an Australian Council on Citizenship will be formed to undertake a comprehensive, independent review of citizenship.
