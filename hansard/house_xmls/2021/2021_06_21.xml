When the e-petitions platform was created it was with the intent of being no more prohibitive than creating or signing a paper petition, and now most petitioners engage with petitioning through the online platform. Despite this, paper petitions remain an important way to engage communities and gather signatures. The standing orders require paper petitions:</span>

More than half of the petitions I present today concern matters related to the COVID-19 virus and the challenges it brings to our everyday lives, while many ministerial responses also focus on addressing the public's concerns regarding the virus. Other matters of concern to petitioners which are included in today's report include taxation, child care and rural health care. These petitions included in today's report will also be referred on to ministers for their response. </span>

The committee looks forward to sharing its findings with the House when available.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">November 4th 2020 is a date of much grief and trauma to the Tigrayan people. It is on this day that the unelected Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali waged a genocidal war against the people of Tigray. Since then Ethiopian National Defence Force, Eritrean Defence Forces and the Amhara regional militia have conducted civilian massacres, extra judicial executions, indiscriminate shelling and acts of horrific sexual violence resulting in the displacement of 2.2 million Tigrayans. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 91% of Tigrayans are in need of urgent food assistance as a direct result of the weaponization of food. Whilst the $3 million Australia has pledged to provide the World Food Programme is much appreciated, there is more that needs to be done.</span>

In many migrants communities, parents stay in the same house and be a part of everyday chores. Mostly, they are the pillars for grandchildren, specially when both parents are working. </span>

Suddenly, when he grows up to be an adult, his parents are gone to just family, not an immediate one. I don't think anyone can believe this. </span>

International parents send their kids to study/live life in most advanced countries without realizing when the same kids return back home, those advanced countries doesn't label them as an immediate family.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current Child Care Subsidy Scheme the Government has placed no rules around how hours can be used by Child Care providers. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that a provider can charge parents for a full 12 hour, or more commonly 10 hour day, even if parents don't require that amount of care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Not only does this mean the Government is paying for thousands of unused hours, but families are also not able to use the hours where they actually need them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current CCS is based on a 9 hour day, but most providers don't allow that, meaning families are either having to pay for hours at full fare or not being able to have their children in the full amount of care the Government has given them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This small change would add no additional cost to the current scheme, but would make a huge difference to the families who rely on it.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider enforcing Child Care Providers to offer "core hours" of 7 and 9 hours to allow parents greater use of their CCS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Core Hours of 8:30-5:30 and 9:00-4:00 would allow parents to spread their full hours across more days of care. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This would also allow Child Care providers more control in hiring staff as they would need the majority of staff during the core hours. </span>

That our basic fundemental freedoms to speak about our faith is being repremanded and vilified not only in the media but also in institutions and workplaces. We have copious examples of people losing jobs just for stating they are Christians and their Christian beliefs. Our words of faith are being treated unfairly and unequally comparitively to other belief systems.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to view this petition in Parliament in support of the Religious Freedom / Discrimination Bills and Amendments. We believe that Christian entities should have the ability to keep our Christian morals, values and ethics and overall ethos in respect to our Christian organisations and businesses. To continually be true to the Bibles words and to state them both privately and publicly and in a respectful manner. The words of the Bible have been the core foundation to our belief system that has existed for thousands of years, which is a right of every individual to aggregate their own belief systems and follow it. We therefore request that the rights of Christians to speak words of the Bible and pray for others in both private and public spaces be permitted and not be discriminated against, seen as derogatory or hate speech. Australia represents equal rights and a democratic society; therefore we ask for our equal right to be able to live our faith without prejudice or bigoting.</span>

Over the last six and nine months respectively, domestic cruises have operated in Singapore and Taiwan with almost 500,000 passengers carried, with no cases or infections whatsoever due to the standard of the operations and the success of those countries in controlling the virus similar to that which Australia has achieved. There are many Australians who will benefit by a prompt resumption including holidaymakers, tourism sector workers, travel agents and primary producers. Ultimately, the presence of cruise ships in Australia will be a crucial part of the recovery of inbound tourism. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, Population Action International has correctly noted that overpopulation is a key factor in the spread of a number of diseases, including coronaviruses; however, according to Healthline, this factor is very often overlooked by policymakers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given the above, the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) should include provisions for dealing with Australia's overpopulation and overcrowding crisis. By managing population numbers, the Act would also address the chronic wait times, overcrowding and ramping that is occurring across the overburdened health sector within Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Every effort must be made to protect children, presently this is not happening. The current opt-out system where parents and schools are paying for adult content blocking software on devices only works if every device and every parent is involved. Where the device protection is not applied, whether due to ignorance or financial hardship, a gate is open, and it only takes one child to share graphic material within the schoolyard and this system is flawed. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Web searches with child based content actually expose explicit images such as 'Disney princess'. The average age of children exposed to adult material continues to lower and is currently nine years. We need significant action to stop unintentional discovery and underage viewing. It's time to stop free-to-view adult content. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Existing precedence is already in place. Television is under legislation to protect child appropriate content and airtime. There is legislation about what can be advertised to children. There are protective bans on cigarette image advertisement. Yet currently it is not illegal to use explicit images as hooks visible to all ages on general web search activity. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to move to an opt-in system and stop explicit images being used as 'free bait'. All adult content should require payment to access in order to protect underage, unintentional viewing.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is a state-owned and funded national public broadcaster. The ABC is independent of political interference in its decision making in accordance with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Over the recent past the government has: (i) Significantly reduced the Corporation's funding resulting in 500 job losses, significantly weakened Radio Australia and closed a number of offices and studios (ii) Revoked the contract for the ABC to provide news into Asia and the Pacific {iii) Sought to interfere in the management of the ABC by failing to appoint directors with skills and demonstrated ability and interest in promoting the charter of the ABC. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to: 1. Restore the ABC funding to at least 2013 levels 2. Restore the funding necessary for the ABC to provide news and other stories into Asia and the Pacific 3.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 February 2021 regarding the House of Representatives Petition EN2035: Review the motion to legislate a Federal Human Rights Act. The former Attorney-General has referred your correspondence to me for response, as the issues fall within my portfolio responsibilities. I appreciate this matter being brought to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is founded on the rule of law and has a strong tradition of respect for the rights and freedoms of every individual. Human rights are recognised and protected across Australia through a range of laws at the federal and state and territory levels, the Australian Constitution, and the common law. Australia is committed to upholding its international legal obligations, including those under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers that existing mechanisms to protect and promote human rights are appropriate, and the legislation necessary to implement Australia's obligations under those international treaties is already in place. On this basis, the Government does not propose to introduce a charter or bill of rights at the federal level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021, concerning a petition seeking full Centrelink payments for working grandparent carers (Petition Ministerial Referral, EN2044).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition referenced in your email raises the important issue of financial support for grandparent carers and appears to seek an exemption from income testing associated with family payments for them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government values the vital contribution of grandparent carers, who are providing a loving home for children who are unable to live with their parents. Grandparent carers may be eligible for the full range of Australian Government family assistance payments such as Family Tax Benefit, Parenting Payment, Child Care Subsidy and Double Orphan Pension (if the child meets the criteria of an orphan), to help with the costs of raising children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family Tax Benefit Part A is the main payment that assists families with the costs of raising dependent children. Family Tax Benefit Part B provides additional support per family to single parent families and couple families where the secondary earner's income is low.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Eligibility for both payments is subject to income testing requirements. This is because the need to support families, including grandparent carers, with the costs of raising children must ultimately be balanced against the need to ensure that assistance is well targeted and remains sustainable into the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, the Government offers several benefits, which specifically recognise the financial needs of grandparents caring for children. For instance, eligibility rules which limit Family Tax Benefit Part B to children aged under 13 years in couple families do not apply to grandparent carers. Family Tax Benefit Part B is payable to eligible grandparent and great grandparent carers with a youngest child aged 13 to 18 years.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning the request for National Broadband Network (NBN) cabling in Glenmorgan Street Brunswick East to be fixed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) is accountable to the Government and to the Australian community for its performance and is building and operating the network on a commercial basis in line with the Government's Statement of Expectations. Network design is an operational matter for the company.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co advises that it completed network rehabilitation works on Glenmorgan Street in December 2020, which included copper rehabilitation and the installation of new telecommunications pit and pipe throughout the street. The company conducts its network assurance activities, pursuant to Schedule 3 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Act 1997</span>. As a result, consideration to heritage overlays is recognised if applicable to the works being undertaken.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As retail broadband providers are responsible for providing the service, I encourage the petitioner to raise all quality and performance issues with them. It is the retailer's responsibility to address service problems for their customers directly and to escalate to NBN Co if the problem or fault lies with the NBN network.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning petition EN2076, calling on the Australian Government to either repeal s474 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015 </span>(Act) or enforce it, in relation to quarantine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 March 2020, the Governor-General made the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 (Declaration) under section 475 of the Act, declaring that a human biosecurity emergency exists. During the human biosecurity emergency period, the Australian Government Minister for Health may determine emergency requirements or directions that he or she is satisfied are necessary to prevent or control the entry, emergence, establishment or spread of COVID-19 in Australian territory or a part of Australian territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 51(ix) of the Australian Constitution provides that the Australian Parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government with respect to quarantine. The powers listed under s51 are not exclusive powers and the states/territories are also able to make laws with respect to the matters listed in s51, including quarantine. If a state or territory makes a law with respect to one of those matters, the state and territory law will only be invalid to the extent it is inconsistent with a law of the Australian Government in relation to the matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 200 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008</span> outlines the emergency powers that can be exercised by authorised officers in Victoria. The power to detain is listed as an emergency power in s200(1). Providing powers to state and territory authorised officers to act in certain circumstances is not inconsistent with s474 of the Act or any other provision of the Act and is not an attempt to delegate the Minister's power in relation to human biosecurity emergencies as set out in the Act. Instead, the Government considers that the exercise of those powers complements the emergency requirements and other action taken by the Government under the Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers within the Act have been primarily used at international borders, for establishing systems and processes to identify and manage public health threats at the point of entry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently four emergency determinations in effect under the Declaration:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">restriction on the movement of cruise vessels (18 March 2020, amended 27 March 2020, amended 20 May 2020, amended 2 September 2020) .</span>

            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">requirement for passengers and aircrew on incoming international flights to wear a mask for the duration of a flight to Australia, and for passengers to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test before departure (22 January 2021).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also has a role in providing necessary funding, policy leadership, and coordination assistance during a national health emergency response. As described in the National Health Security Agreement, state and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their respective jurisdictions. Specific measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory in Australia have been put in place and are enforceable under the respective laws of each state and territory. Accordingly, any COVID-19 measures in place in Victoria that are specified in Victorian legislation remain enforceable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments' actions are based on the medical advice from their respective Chief Health Officer to allow for an appropriate response adapted to each jurisdiction's local conditions and pandemic response stage. The public health and emergency legislation in each jurisdiction imposes local measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory, including quarantine and self-isolation, closing of non-essential businesses, and imposing requirements to wear Personal Protective Equipment (such as face masks).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If required, the quarantine power under the Act may be exercised concurrently with the states and territories . For example, under the Act, the Australian Government Chief Medical Officer may declare a human health response zone and may impose on individuals a human biosecurity control order for the purpose of managing risks to human health, such as requiring people to be quarantined.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian, state and territory governments are working together to coordinate an evidence-based response to COVID-19, based on the latest medical advice. Together these actions have placed Australia in a good position globally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 February 2021 regarding the House of Representatives petition EN2078, which requests the House to introduce a law to give pedestrians the right to forward video evidence of noisy vehicles to a national register.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government administers the <span style="font-style:italic;">Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989</span>, which requires that all new road vehicles comply with national standards known as the Australian Design Rules (ADRs) before they can be offered to the market for use in transport. The ADRs are generally performance-based standards for vehicle safety, theft protection and emission control. Emission control covers noxious gases and external noise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ADRs, including the requirements for external noise, are broadly harmonised with international vehicle regulations. Vehicle sales in Australia represent less than one per cent of the total world production of motor vehicles. Regulation based on internationally agreed standards like the UN regulations provides consumers with access to the safest vehicles from the global market at the lowest possible cost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once a vehicle has been supplied to the market in Australia, responsibility for regulation passes to the relevant state or territory government. Generally speaking, states and territories require vehicles to continue to comply with ADR requirements. Responsibility for enforcement of noise requirements for vehicles in service lies with either the police or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in each state or territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the challenges with regulating vehicle noise emissions in service is that the performance of vehicles changes over time with deterioration of engines and silencers, as well as modifications made by vehicle owners. If a member of the public wishes to report a concern about the noise emitted from a particular vehicle in service, it is best for them to do this through the relevant state or territory government authority (i.e. the police or EPA). This will help these authorities to best target their enforcement activities, including to identify those vehicles that have been modified in a way which causes them to exceed acceptable noise limits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 15 February 2021 to the Treasurer, the Hon Josh Frydenberg, concerning Petition EN2081 which requests legislation to require online retailers operating in Australia to include country of origin labelling (CoOL) for all products. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister responsible for CoOL.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of providing consumers with country of origin information on products offered for sale in Australia. This is why we made necessary reforms to CoOL in 2016, to ensure consumers have increased transparency and information about the origin of food products. The reforms strengthened CoOL requirements for some food products, however they did not mandate CoOL for all products sold in-store or on websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We appreciate the groundswell of support for Australian made products in the wake of COVID- 19, and the recognition that supporting local manufacturers and producers will be a vital part of our economic recovery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is mindful of the potential costs to industry in mandating CoOL for all goods, including those sold online. Costs of such a scheme need to be weighed against the potential benefits to consumers, and consideration would need to be given to the practicalities of how laws might apply if a website was hosted outside of Australia's jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Mandatory labelling requirements would need to be consistent with Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organization and our Free Trade Agreements which stipulate that imported products must be treated no less favourably than domestically produced products. Any perceptions from Australia's trading partners that such requirements are inconsistent with international commitments must be carefully considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021 regarding Petition EN2088, which relates to media independence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that the petition requests the House of Representatives "… to take necessary legislative measures to review the current code of conduct in Australian journalism and to enact effective laws to protect the freedom of information and freedom of speech for ordinary Australians."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government believes that a balanced, robust and independent media sector plays an important role in a healthy democracy. It is committed to policies that encourage an Australian media sector that offers competitive and diverse services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where media services are regulated in Australia, the framework they are subject to depends on the media platform on which they are provided. The importance of a free media is recognised under these frameworks through an emphasis on industry playing a leading role in the development and administration of content regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most media content broadcast on commercial and subscription television and radio in Australia is regulated by co-regulatory codes of practice developed by broadcasting industry sectors in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span>. These co-regulatory arrangements recognise the importance of television and radio content being in line with community expectations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The codes cover commercial free-to-air television broadcasters, subscription television broadcasters and commercial radio broadcasters and include requirements on the broadcast of news and current affairs programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice </span>provides that in broadcasting a news or current affairs program, a licensee must present factual material accurately and ensure viewpoints included in the program are not misrepresented. The Commercial TV Code also provides that in broadcasting a news program, a licensee must present news fairly and impartially and clearly distinguish the reporting of factual material from commentary and analysis. Similar requirements are included in the Subscription TV and Commercial Radio codes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The co-regulatory codes of practice include procedures for handling complaints. Complaints about news stories, including the accuracy and neutrality in news reporting , can be made by the public and should be directed to the broadcaster in the first instance. If a complainant is unsatisfied with the response, they may refer the complaint to ACMA for investigation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commercial print and online news publications in Australia, such as newspapers, predominately operate under self-regulatory arrangements. These recognise the importance of a print media sector in which media standards reflect community expectations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Press Council (APC) is the self-regulatory body with responsibility for promoting standards relating to media practice. It is the principal body with responsibility for handling complaints about most major Australian newspapers, magazines and associated digital outlets as well as some independent online-only news services. Most other magazines, newspapers and associated digital outlets, including those published by West Australian Newspapers, are subject to the self-regulatory arrangements administered by the Independent Media Council (IMC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All publications subject to the APC's remit are required to take reasonable steps to comply with the APC's Standards of Practice. The standards require, among other things, publications to ensure factual material in news reports and elsewhere is accurate and not misleading and is distinguishable from other material such as opinion. Publications must also ensure that factual material is presented with reasonable fairness and balance and that writers' expressions of opinion are not based on significantly inaccurate factual material or omission of key facts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The IMC Code of Conduct provides, among other things, that publications must take all reasonable steps to ensure reports are honest, accurate, balanced and fair and disclose all essential facts and that reports must not supress relevant available facts or give distorting emphasis. Both codes include procedures for public complaints.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the self-regulatory Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) <span style="font-style:italic;">Journalist Code of Ethics</span> applies to MEAA Media's journalist members. Although voluntary, this is an additional level of self-regulation that MEAA member journalists are accountable to.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC and SBS have content and operational independence. Parliament has guaranteed this independence so the broadcasters' decisions are free of political interference.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Acts enabling both the ABC and SBS require their boards to ensure that the news and information that they present is accurate and impartial. Although editorially independent, the ABC and SBS Boards are required to develop codes of practice relating to programming matters and to lodge these codes with ACMA. In addition, the ABC and SBS are accountable to the Parliament through annual reports, corporate plans, financial and performance audits and appearances before Parliamentary Committees.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, regarding petition EN2094 which requests that the Government make 'I Am Australian' the Australian National Anthem. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf as the Minister responsible for national symbols policy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, on 1 January 2021, the second line of Advance Australia Fair changed from 'For we are young and free' to 'For we are one and free'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The change was made for all Australians. Our Anthem is about us, who we are, and who we hope to be.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We live in a timeless land of ancient Indigenous Australians, and we draw together the stories of more than 300 national ancestries and language groups. We are the most successful and cohesive multicultural nation on earth. Our Anthem honours the foundations upon which our nation has been built, as well as the aspirations we share for the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the past year, we have shown once again the indomitable spirit of Australians and the united effort that has always enabled us to prevail as a nation. It is time to ensure this great unity is reflected more fully in our national anthem.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2096 concerning a jury of peers. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand Petition EN2096 seeks to create legislation to establish a representative jury of peers for cases referred to it by community representatives or political electives. The proposed body would be able to consider immigration cases and override Ministerial and legal decisions relating to permanent residence or protection.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I appreciate the suggestions raised in Petition EN2096, I am confident that Australia has a robust framework for reviewing decisions and considering exceptional cases. This includes an independent review tribunal and personal Ministerial Intervention powers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) provides independent merits review of administrative decisions made under Commonwealth laws. For migration decisions, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span> (the Act) governs which decisions the AAT can review, and who may seek review of a decision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions reviewable under Part 5 or Part 7 of the Act are reviewed "on the merits", meaning the tribunal makes a new and independent decision after considering the relevant facts, law and policy. Following this consideration, the AAT may affirm a decision, vary a decision, set aside a decision and substitute a new decision, or remit a decision to the decision-maker for reconsideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, where a person has not succeeded in having a decision set aside at the AAT, Ministers administering the Act also have a discretionary power under the Act to replace that decision with one that is more favourable to that person, if they consider it to be in the public interest. This power is designed for unique or exceptional circumstances - the Ministerial Intervention guidelines stipulate the types of cases that should or should not be referred for ministerial consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2096 to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition EN2098 concerning the request for the removal of the 20-hour work limitation for international students to address the impact of declining student visa applications, for reasons including the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 23 April 2020, the former acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, announced that the Australian Government was making changes to student visa work conditions to help frontline health efforts to manage COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These visa measures have been implemented to ensure registered aged care and disability providers can continue to supply critical services by allowing student visa holders already employed in their organisation to work more than the 40 hours per fortnight usually allowed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These special circumstances are time limited and the enforcement of visa conditions will return to normal once we move to a new COVID Safe normal. All temporary COVID-19 visa-related measures, such as the relaxation of working hour restrictions for some international students, are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are commensurate with the challenges posed by the pandemic, while not displacing or preventing employment opportunities for Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2098 to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, providing the petition EN2104 under Standing Order 209(a) and (b) to the former Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the Hon Stuart Robert MP. As the Minister now responsible for the NDIS, I am providing a written response to this petition to be considered by the Standing Committee on Petitions (the Committee).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to assure the Committee that the Australian Government is committed to ensuring all people with disability, including people with epilepsy, have access to a range of supports that will allow them, their families and carers to participate as valued members of society.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People with disability are able to access assistance through the NDIS if they meet the requirements set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</span> (NDIS Act), including age, residency and disability or early intervention requirements. Generally, a person will be eligible for the NDIS if their disability is, or is likely to be, permanent and significantly affects their communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Act does not base eligibility on types of disability or on the presence of an underlying condition, illness or injury. To this extent, a person's diagnosis and any secondary disabilities they may have are not relevant to their eligibility for the scheme and the supports they will receive in their plans, except to the extent they affect a person's communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management, and are, or are likely to be permanent. People with epilepsy can become NDIS participants and receive individualised funding for supports if they meet the requirements set out in the NDIS Act, including providing evidence of the functional impact of their disability on activities of daily living. However, not all people with epilepsy will meet the requirements in the NDIS Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All governments are continuing to work to resolve how the NDIS and other services (such as health services) should work together, so that people with disability receive the right services and achieve the best possible outcomes, including people with epilepsy. The NDIS is not intended or designed to replace other essential services on which people with disability and the wider population rely. This includes health services, school age education, public transport, public and social housing and community services provided by governments. Rather, all governments, including state and territory governments, have an important role in ensuring publicly funded and provided services are inclusive and accessible for all Australians, including people with epilepsy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this regard, the design of the NDIS reflects the Productivity Commission's recommendation that the NDIS should invest in the care and support needs of people with permanent and significant disability to assist them to live an ordinary life, recognising that it is one part of a broader system of supports. To this extent, people with epilepsy may also be eligible for other supports provided by all governments, such as the Disability Support Pension (DSP). The DSP is one type of a range of income supports provided by the Australian Government that is available for people of working age, providing a safety net for those who have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric condition that stops them from working, or for those who are permanently blind.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021 referring petition number EN2112 where petitioners request an audit of Australian electoral processes. I am responding as the Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There already exists a comprehensive system of oversight that supports Australia's electoral processes. This is led by the Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM), which conducts inquiries on matters relating to electoral laws and practices and their administration. For example, on 10 December 2020, JSCEM tabled its report on the 2019 Federal election making 27 recommendations on a broad range of electoral issues, after receiving 172 submissions and holding nine public hearings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce established in 2018 supports the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and other Australian electoral management bodies to respond to issues relating to the integrity of Australian elections. The Taskforce includes the AEC, the departments of Finance, Home Affairs, Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet and the Australian Federal Police and is supported by Australia's national intelligence community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) also supports accountability and transparency through undertaking independent audits of various Commonwealth entities, including the AEC. The ANAO helps to ensure the Australian public can have confidence in the actions of Commonwealth entities, and that public resources are being used economically, efficiently, effectively and ethically.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021 concerning petition number EN2117, requesting recommencement of negotiations on a Social Security Agreement between Australia and France.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the strong interest from Australians living in France in progressing a Social Security Agreement between Australia and France. Australian and French officials previously held discussions about a possible agreement several years ago. However, agreement could not be reached on terms which were satisfactory to both countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Social security agreements can only be concluded where there is mutual interest and reciprocal terms can be agreed between the two parties.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As agreements typically represent a cost to the Australian Budget, any decision to enter further negotiations must also be carefully considered in the context of other relative spending priorities, including financial impacts and the broader economic and diplomatic benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral of petition number EN2121, which was presented to the House of Representatives on 15 February 2021, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, regarding freedom of religion, blasphemy and hate speech and Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). This petition has been referred to the Attorney-General's portfolio as the matters raised fall within the Attorney-General's portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to its international human rights obligations and ensures that its laws accord with those obligations. This includes those rights that are enshrined in the ICCPR. Rights under the ICCPR are protected across Australia through a range of laws, policies and institutions at the federal and state and territory level. The Constitution and common law contain further rights protections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the particular issues the authors have drawn to the Government's attention, I make the following comments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong defender of traditional rights and liberties, and is committed to protecting freedom of religion. Australia is home to a diversity of faiths, united by tolerance, mutual respect and a commitment to democratic traditions. Australia's cultural and religious diversity is a source of social and economic strength, and is a key part of Australian life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government strongly believes that all Australians, regardless of their religious belief, should be able to fully participate in our society. The Government recognises that there is an opportunity to further enhance and better protect freedom of religion under Australian laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For this reason the Government has prepared a package of draft legislation to implement recommendations from the Expert Panel to the Religious Freedom Review (the Religious Freedom Review), which delivered its report in May 2018. This includes a proposed Religious Discrimination Bill, which would provide protection against discrimination on the basis of religious belief or activity in specified areas of public life.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Blasphemy is not an offence under Commonwealth law. The Religious Freedom Review concluded that blasphemy (an offence that addresses ridicule or insult to religious groups, customs or beliefs) is out of step with a modern, tolerant, multicultural society. Indeed, blasphemy laws are out of step with the expectations of the Australian community and Australian values.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 February 2021 to the former Attorney-General, the Hon Christian Porter MP, regarding Petition EN2127, which requests that the House of Representatives remove the Hon Alan Tudge MP from Parliament. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition on the former Attorney-General's behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The authors of this petition contend that Mr Tudge is a dual citizen and therefore incapable of sitting as a Member of the House of Representatives under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Section 44(i) makes a person who 'is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power ... incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not provide legal advice to members of the public about the application of constitutional eligibility criteria to particular parliamentarians. However, there is some general information available about the application of section 44(i). In particular, the Australian Electoral Commission's publication <span style="font-style:italic;">Constitutional Disqualifications and Intending Candidates on the Commission</span> website includes information on section 44(i). A copy of this publication is available online at </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 47 of the Constitution provides that, '[u]ntil the Parliament otherwise provides', questions about the qualifications of senators or members of the House of Representatives are to be determined by the relevant House. Parliament has otherwise provided in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span>. Any question of section 44 incapability is to be determined by the House of Representatives or Senate itself under section 47 of the Constitution, unless either House resolves to refer the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns pursuant to section 376 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span>.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following a number of High Court cases concerning parliamentarians who were dual citizens and section 44(i) of the Constitution in 2017 and 2018, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters considered reform options for section 44. The Committee's report, published in May 2018, is accessible online here:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following that report, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> was amended to require candidates for federal elections to submit a qualification checklist when nominating. Also, the House of Representatives and the Senate adopted resolutions introducing a procedure for a Committee of the relevant House to investigate issues concerning a parliamentarians' citizenship before the House refers a question about their qualifications for determination by the High Court.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Resettlement Allowance was introduced in 2006 to assist former senators and members re-establish themselves in the workforce. The introduction of the Allowance followed amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 in 2001, and subsequent changes to superannuation accumulation arrangements introduced under the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition (EN2132) - prevent airlines and other travel companies from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccinations.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) generally allows businesses to set terms and conditions relating to the purchase of their goods or services, provided these businesses do not mislead or deceive consumers, or breach other protections in the ACL. So long as a vaccination requirement is made clear to consumers at the time of purchase, it is unlikely such a requirement would breach the ACL. If a consumer has already purchased a good or service (such as an airline ticket), the business should not impose a vaccination requirement retrospectively.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">International human rights law recognises that restrictions on rights, such as the right to freedom of movement, may be limited in certain circumstances, including responding to a public health crisis. However, to strike an appropriate balance, such measures must be necessary and proportionate to the evaluated risk, must respect people's dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and be in place for the shortest time possible. The Australian Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic aims to protect the health and wellbeing of all Australians, their livelihoods and jobs, and ensure that Australia is positioned to emerge strong and resilient following the pandemic.</span>

This includes all aspects of service in the ADF and the experience of those transitioning; the availability and quality of health and support services; pre-service and post-service issues for members and veterans; members' and veterans' social and family contexts, such as family breakdown, as well as housing and employment issues for members and veterans.</span>

The Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, has portfolio responsibility for Royal Commissions and the administration of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions Act 1902</span> (Cth). I will provide feedback from the public consultation process to the Attorney-General to lead the process for the drafting of the Letters Patent for the establishment of the Royal Commission.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021, concerning petition number EN2152, requesting the House of Representatives investigate the influence of Rupert Murdoch on Australia's media industry.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of the petition have expressed concern about the influence of the Murdoch-owned News Corporation (News Corp) in Australia, citing a misleading article published about the principle petitioner. The signatories are requesting that the House of Representatives investigate the influence of News Corp in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports a diverse and sustainable media sector. It also recognises that quality news and public interest journalism play an important role in the functioning of Australian society and democracy and is essential to informing local communities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commercial print and online news publications in Australia, such as those operated by News Corp, predominately operate under self-regulatory arrangements. These are intended to recognise the importance of a print media sector in which media standards reflect community expectations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Press Council (APC) is the self-regulatory industry body with responsibility for promoting standards relating to media practice. It is the principal body with responsibility for handling complaints about most major Australian newspapers, magazines and associated digital outlets as well as some independent online-only news services. Most other magazines, newspapers and associated digital outlets, including those published by West Australian Newspapers, are subject to the self-regulatory arrangements administered by the Independent Media Council (IMC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All publications that are subject to the APC's remit are required to take reasonable steps to comply with the APC's Standards of Practice. The standards require, among other things, publications to ensure that factual material in news reports and elsewhere is accurate and not misleading and is distinguishable from other material such as opinion. Publications must also ensure that factual material is presented with reasonable fairness and balance and that writers' expressions of opinion are not based on significantly inaccurate factual material or omission of key facts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The IMC Code of Conduct provides, among other things, that publications must take all reasonable steps to ensure reports are honest, accurate, balanced and fair and disclose all essential facts and that reports must not supress relevant available facts or give distorting emphasis. Both codes include procedures for public complaints. Additionally, the self-regulatory Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) Journalist Code of Ethics applies to MEAA Media' s journalist members. Although voluntary, this is an additional level of self-regulation that MEAA member journalists are accountable to.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 regarding petition number EN2154. The petition requests a Royal Commission into the Department of Veterans' Affairs, veteran services, supports and advocates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you will be aware, on 19 April 2021 the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, announced the Australian Government's intention to establish a Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide from 1 July 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commission is expected to examine the systemic issues and any common themes in past deaths by suicide of Australian Defence Force (ADF) members and veterans and the experience of members and veterans who may continue to be at risk of suicide. This includes all aspects of service in the ADF and the experience of those transitioning; the availability and quality of health and support services; pre-service and post-service issues for members and veterans; members' and veterans' social and family contexts, such as family breakdown, as well as housing and employment issues for members and veterans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has asked me to lead a public consultation process around these themes to inform the Terms of Reference for the Royal Commission. The Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, has portfolio responsibility for Royal Commissions and the administration of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions Act 1902</span> (Cth). I will provide feedback from the public consultation process to the Attorney-General to lead the process for the drafting of the Letters Patent for the establishment of the Royal Commission. ADF members, veterans and their families, as well as other interested stakeholders, are also able to provide feedback directly to the Attorney-General's Department through its website.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 February 2021 regarding petition number EN2155 concerning a permit issued to allow eligible freight jet aircraft to operate during curfew periods at Gold Coast Airport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 8 of the Air Navigation (Gold Coast Airport Curfew) Regulations 2018 (the Regulations) prohibits an aircraft taking off from or landing at Gold Coast Airport during a curfew period unless permitted under Part 3 or 4 of the Regulations. Part 3 of the Regulations, in particular sections 12 and 13, provide that four movements of eligible freight jet aircraft are permitted during curfew periods in a single week, but these can only be used by the operator of an aircraft if they hold a permit under section 13.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Regulations allow four curfew movements, and specify the type of aircraft that can undertake, the decision-making is primarily focussed on which operator is permitted to operate the aircraft (i.e. allocating the available movements equitably among operators).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 17 September 2020, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications received an application from Qantas Freight Enterprises, requesting four jet aircraft freight movements each week during the curfew period at Gold Coast Airport. The application sought the movements to assist with freight operations in the region following the substantial reduction in passenger services, which were down by around 80 per cent due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to COVID, a significant amount of freight would be carried on the passenger services but following the reduction, there was insufficient movements to fully meet the freight task.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 September 2020, a delegate from the Department, under section 13(1) of the Regulations granted a permit to Qantas Freight Enterprises to operate four jet aircraft freight movements each week during curfew periods at Gold Coast Airport to assist in managing the freight task, in particular time sensitive overnight items.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision ensured that adequate freight connectivity was maintained, producing positive economic benefits to the region for local businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The delegate considered the noise impact on the community with the introduction of these operations and asked the aircraft operator, Gold Coast Airport and Airservices Australia to inform the Gold Coast Community Aviation Consultation Group (CACG) and Airport Noise Abatement Consultative Committee (ANACC) of the permit and the noise implications for surrounding communities before flights commenced. Information regarding this permit was provided to the ANACC meeting on 15 October 2020 and CACG meeting on 4 November 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The delegate granted weekly freight quota movements under the permit between 5 October 2020 and 25 June 2021. Conditions were included in the permit which require the aircraft to comply with Gold Coast Airport Noise Abatement Procedures to reduce the noise impact on the surrounding community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The applicant and the airport operator conducted a number of engagement activities after the permit was provided. These included:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A joint Qantas Airways and Gold Coast Airport letter dated 30 September 2020 to the CACG and ANACC highlighting the details of the permit and noting the Administrative Appeals Tribunal review of decision process, with a deadline of 23 October 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Community engagement and discussion at the ANACC on 15 October 2020 and the CACG on 5 November 2020.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A joint Gold Coast Airport and Australia Post news story about the services in November 2020, which was published in the Gold Coast Bulletin.</span>

The community engagement has been ongoing throughout the operations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The permit commenced on 5 October 2020 and expires on 25 June 2021. The Department will continue to monitor the level of services at the Gold Coast Airport leading up to expiry to determine whether any further permits are required.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 February 2021 to the former Attorney-General, the Hon Christian Porter MP, regarding a petition to remove multiple marital status female pronouns from all documentation.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to eliminating discrimination against women. The Federal <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span> makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, breastfeeding and family responsibilities in certain areas of public life.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is not the Government's role to mandate the use of any titles. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Marriage Act 1961</span> does not require, create or impose any titles on individuals upon marriage. The use of titles is a matter of individual choice, based on social, professional and linguistic practices. A married person is free to use whichever title they wish. In regards to government forms and records, the Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender do not provide specific direction on what titles should be used. However, options should be provided for individuals to select their preferred title or use no title at all.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The ASGS and Remoteness Areas are created by the ABS to enable the release of statistical information to inform research and policy analysis relating to people and businesses in communities across Australia. The ABS advises me that the ASGS itself, and the Remoteness Areas structure within it, are not designed with funding programs in mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Remoteness Areas approximate access to services and contain five categories: Major Cities of Australia; Inner Regional Australia; Outer Regional Australia; Remote Australia and Very Remote Australia. The islands within the Southern Morton Bay Island group have different classifications, with Macleay Island classified as Inner Regional, and Lamb Island, Karragarra Island and Russell Island as Outer Regional in the ASGS editions released in alignment with both the 2011 and 2016 Census.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The process for defining the Remoteness Areas has been consistently applied since 2006, following a consultation process in 2001. The Remoteness Areas were last updated in March 2018 (following the 2016 Census) and are updated every 5 years in alignment with the Census of Population and Housing. .</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian, state and territory government agencies have incorporated Remoteness Areas into their eligibility criteria for government programs and reporting. For example, the Department of Health has incorporated the ABS definition of Remoteness Areas into the Modified Monash Model (MMM), which is used to inform eligibility criteria for a number of health programs. The MMM contains seven categories, and also considers the distance offshore of populated islands. The Department of Health would be best placed to address queries related to eligibility for federal funding of health programs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021 in relation to Petition EN2177 concerning grant processes in the Australian screen industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Screen Australia is the Australian Government's primary agency for supporting Australian film, television, documentary and digital media makers. It provides direct investment in screen development and production and understands the importance of independent screen producers to the production ecosystem.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There have been a number of reviews and consultations undertaken on support for the screen sector and its appropriateness, including the recent process to consult on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Supporting Australian Stories on our Screens: Options Paper</span>. This process resulted in additional funding of $33 million to support Screen Australia for drama, documentary and children's content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Funding under Screen Australia's grant programs is highly contested. In 2019-20, Screen Australia processed 2,077 funding applications of which 518 were successful. Screen Australia's funding programs support a diversity of stories through development and production investments across a range of platforms that resonate with audiences locally and internationally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of Screen Australia funding programs require that producers demonstrate that there is an acceptable offer to exhibit the project in cinemas in Australia, and an acceptable offer to represent the project for Rest of World (ROW) sales. This requirement ensures that there is a genuine intention for the cinematic release of the productions that are funded. While it is a requirement that finance is in place and a distributor and international sales agent are attached, there is some discretion for low-budget projects. Applicants are encouraged to contact Screen Australia's Program Operations team on 1800 507 901 before submitting an application to discuss any eligibility questions and ensure all the required supporting material is in place.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to production funding, Screen Australia offers a broad range of funding programs to support the development and marketing of Australian screen content as well as for the development of Australian talent and screen production businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government provides other avenues of support for film and television production. The Australian Screen Production Incentive (ASPI) is the Government's primary mechanism for providing support to the screen industry. Comprising the Producer Offset, Location Offset and Post, Digital and Visual Effects (PDV) Offset, the ASPI provides taxation rebates for expenditure on eligible productions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments also provide support for screen development and production through a range of mechanisms. Further information relating to each of the state agencies can be found at www.arts.gov.au/what-we-do/screen/filming-australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021 regarding Petition EN2181, which relates to truth in political advertising.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that the petition requests the House of Representatives to "create laws banning dishonest political advertising in Australia."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government recognises the importance of advertisements being legal, honest, truthful and not offensive to their audience. There are a number of self-regulatory arrangements in place for advertising, which are intended to strike a balance between legitimate commercial interests and appropriate community safeguards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The content of advertisements in Australia is predominantly subject to self-regulatory arrangements. These are underpinned by codes of practice developed by the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA), the advertising industry peak body, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">AANA Code of Ethics</span>. Advertising complaints are administered by Ad Standards. Ad Standards assess the advertising complaints it receives to determine whether they are eligible for consideration by the Ad Standards Community Panel (the Panel).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although the <span style="font-style:italic;">AANA Code of Ethics</span> has provisions about the discrimination and vilification of a person or a section of the community on certain grounds, including their political beliefs, the code does not consider the truthfulness or accuracy of political advertising. More information is available at the Ad Standards website: adstandards.com.au/issues/political-and-election-advertising.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a member of the public has specific concerns about the truth or accuracy of a particular political advertisement, they should raise these concerns directly with the relevant advertiser and/or their member of parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Industry self-regulation provides a flexible approach to meeting the challenges of the ever-evolving advertising, marketing and media industry, along with changing consumer expectations. The self-regulatory framework reflects that it should be advertisers who bear the primary responsibility for the content of their advertisements. Further information about the advertising content self-regulatory arrangements is available on the Ad Standards website at adstandards.com.au/about/self-regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 February 2021 about petition EN2185 and the Cashless Debit Card (CDC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDC supports people, families and communities by ensuring income support payments are not spent on items that can cause social harm. This includes alcohol, drugs and gambling products. The CDC also assists as a useful budgeting tool to provide participants with assistance to budget better for their circumstances. In conjunction with other reforms, the CDC can also help stabilise the circumstances of the individual for whom drug, alcohol and gambling addiction are an issue, enabling them to seek and take up education and employment opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDC is a sophisticated Visa Debit Card that can be used at around one million EFTPOS terminals across Australia and supports people to spend their income support payment on essential items. The CDC can be used for online shopping and making direct debits and transfers. It also offers new technologies such as contactless payments and a mobile phone banking application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDC applies to income support payments in the Ceduna region in South Australia, the East Kimberley and Goldfields region in Western Australia, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay and Cape York regions in Queensland, and the Northern Territory. It does not apply to income support payment recipients, or other individuals, outside of these locations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021 referring petition EN2191. I am responding as the Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition, which requests that the House of Representatives reject any legislative amendments based on recommendations from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' (JSCEM) Report on the conduct of the 2019 Federal Election and matters related thereto (the Report).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years, successful reforms to Australia's electoral system have followed work conducted by the JSCEM. The JSCEM reports are informed by public hearings and submissions. For example, on 10 December 2020, JSCEM tabled its report on the 2019 Federal election making 27 recommendations on a broad range of electoral issues, after receiving 172 submissions and holding nine public hearings. The Government is considering each of these recommendations, and will provide a response to the Report in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am unaware of any recommendation from the Report that suggest legislative amendments to remove compulsory voting in Australia. The Government supports compulsory voting as it strengthens our democratic process and ensures that the vast majority of citizens actively participate in elections.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to safeguarding Australia's electoral system, and considers voter confidence in election processes imperative to the functioning of our democracy. While reforms to mandate voter identification could be one method to provide additional confidence, such a policy would require legislative amendment, and appears unlikely to attract bipartisan support at this time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Fortunately, voter identification is not the only mechanism available to increase confidence in our electoral system. As part of the 2020-21 Budget measure <span style="font-style:italic;">Electoral Commission - </span><span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">CT modernisation</span>, the Government has provided $96.7 million over three years to commence the modernisation of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ICT systems and infrastructure, providing further safeguards to protect the integrity of federal elections and improve services to Australian voters. Further funding of $26.8 million was provided in the 2020-21 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure <span style="font-style:italic;">AEC </span><span style="font-style:italic;">–</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Polling</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Place Technology</span> to support the continued rollout of what are referred to as 'Electronic Certified Lists' (ECLs), which allow polling booths across the country to communicate in real-time. This ensures voters marked off the roll in one area are prevented from voting again elsewhere, catching out instances of multiple-voting in federal elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is being achieved administratively, without the need for legislative change. Australia is fortunate as a democratic nation to experience few instances of voter fraud, and this investment in technology is designed to keep it that way. We continue to review measures on how best to ensure the integrity of voting, so Australians can continue to have unwavering trust in their federal elections.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is actively considering the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) report from its inquiry into the conduct of the 2019 Federal Election, which was tabled on 10 December 2020.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can opt out of most telemarketing calls by registering their numbers on the Register. If the petitioners have not done so already, I would recommend they list their numbers on the Register to help minimise the number of unsolicited telemarketing calls they receive.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a prosperous and socially cohesive democracy. We have one of the world's most tolerant and thriving multicultural societies. Present day Australia owes its strength and prosperity in no small part to the economic and social contributions of the successive generations of migrants coming to our shores.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 to the former Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC, concerning Petition EN2256 - Reforms to the Redress of Grievance and Defence inquiry processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The welfare of Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and their families is of paramount concern to me and Defence leadership. I recognise that complaint and inquiry processes can be challenging. The Department of Defence and other agencies provide current and former ADF personnel and their families a range of assistance including mental health, medical, legal, pastoral and social work services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am committed to ensuring that Defence has a fair, equitable and efficient military justice system that resolves issues in a manner that is timely and sensitive to the welfare of members of the ADF and other people affected by military justice processes. It must also provide the right balance between individual rights, the maintenance of military discipline and operational effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the last seven years Defence has progressed significant reforms to improve the management of incidents, administrative inquiry processes and the redress of grievance system. These reforms address the issues raised in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 8 November 2011, Defence commissioned a review of all inquiry, investigation, review and audit systems, processes and structures across Defence. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Re-Thinking Systems of Inquiry, Investigation, Review and Audit</span> report looked holistically at arrangements across all of Defence's ADF, APS and integrated workplaces, and proposed models for reform from a 'first principles' perspective.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Key reforms since 2014 have:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">simplified incident reporting arrangements for commanders and managers and provided a single system for reporting incidents</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">provided commanders and managers with flexible options for fact finding that are adaptable to the circumstances and in proportion to the scale of issues under consideration</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">removed unnecessary formality and complexity from decision-making, empowering commanders and managers to apply judgment, manage risk, and be accountable for their decisions</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">formalised training, overseen by the Military Law Centre, for staff who conduct fact finding and statutory inquiries</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">enhanced the independence of the Inspector-General of the ADF (IGADF) from the ordinary chain of command through legislative reform</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">transformed the redress of grievance process into a more streamlined process overseen by the independent IGADF</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">transferred responsibility for inquiry into Service-related deaths to the IGADF.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms outlined above have resulted in more timely decision-making, less complexity and formality in most cases, reduced timelines for resolution of redress of grievance, and provided greater oversight and accountability. For example, the total average time take to finalise grievances is now 85 days (with a median of 63 days), compared to an average time, prior to 2016, of 116 days at the unit level, 498 days at the first level of review by a Service Chief, and 818 days at second level of review by the Chief of Defence Force.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence values mediation as a mechanism to resolve workplace complaints, recognising that early intervention strategies empower individuals to proactively work toward resolution at the lowest appropriate level. A range of dispute resolution options are available to all Defence personnel, regardless of ADF rank, employee classification or contractor status.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Readily accessible support and guidance is offered through qualified and extensively trained alternative dispute practitioners and a comprehensive network of workplace behaviour advisors located across Australia to foster early resolution of disputes and effective management of complaints. Alternative dispute resolution options include:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence is currently trialling a new approach, through the Improved Complaint Handling Trial, to ensure that commanders and individuals are supported and encouraged to consider alternative resolution options early in the complaints process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence is a large and complex organisation that conducts a wide range of activities and Defence commanders and managers receive and deal with thousands of Incident Reports each year. For the vast majority of incidents, Defence commanders and managers undertake routine fact finding activities to support their decision-making and manage incidents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For a small number of more complex incidents, the commander may appoint a statutory inquiry, such as an Inquiry Officer Inquiry, under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 2018</span> (the regulations). For example, 25 Inquiry Officer Inquiries were commenced or completed in the financial year 2019-2020. The majority of these inquiries were completed within six months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of an administrative inquiry is to facilitate the making of decisions relating to the Defence Force by providing accurate, reliable and timely information. Consistent with the practice of Commonwealth administrative tribunals and inquiries, Defence statutory inquiries are not bound by the rules of evidence, legal forms or technicalities. The regulations specify that inquiries must be conducted fairly and comply with rules of procedural fairness. All inquiry reports are subject to mandatory legal review before submission to the appointing authority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The regulations contain both protections and obligations for witnesses. Witnesses who give evidence before a Defence inquiry are protected against reprisals, liability in civil proceedings and self-incrimination. These protections are important as witnesses are under an obligation to answer questions. However, the regulations also make it an offence to give false evidence to a Defence inquiry, and evidence given by a witness can be used in a prosecution for giving false testimony. Witness testimony is rarely, if ever, subject to legal professional privilege. It is in the public interest to provide witnesses with these protections, as a balance against the obligation to answer questions, and to facilitate the ability of Defence to obtain information on serious, sensitive or complex matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The military justice system is overseen by the IGADF, a statutorily appointed position established by the Defence Act 1903, empowered to inquire into matters concerning the Defence Force, including the military justice system and deaths of ADF members. The IGADF independently exposes and examines failures and flaws in the military justice system. ADF members can make submissions to the IGADF about any matter relating to military justice. Accordingly, complaints regarding Defence statutory inquiries can be raised with the IGADF. The IGADF also directly oversees the redress of grievance system, through which an ADF member can complain about matters affecting their service in the ADF.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Defence Force Ombudsman, who is not part of the Department of Defence, is also empowered to investigate complaints about actions and decisions of Defence arising from present or past service. Ordinarily, the Defence Force Ombudsman will investigate a complaint where internal review mechanisms have been exhausted. As an example of the improvements made by Defence in managing applications for redress of grievance, since 2016 complaints to the Defence Force Ombudsman relating to delays in resolving redress of grievance have markedly declined.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence is continuing to implement important programs to enhance our military justice system. Key ongoing initiatives include:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Enhancing assurance of the military justice system, setting baseline requirements against which assurance monitoring is conducted, and seeking process and efficiency improvements across the military justice system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Progressing (through the Defence Enterprise Resource Planning Program) the development of a simplified, integrated and standardised enterprise case management system for entering, tracking, resolving and reporting personnel related incidents and cases relating to integrity, legal and audit matters. This capability will enhance the collection of relevant and targeted metrics to support the continuous monitoring and improvement of the military justice system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 16 March 2021 concerning Petition EN2270 which raises concerns about Optus' customer service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government's role in the telecommunications regime is to establish the legislative and regulatory framework within which service providers operate. The Government recognises the reliance Australians place on telecommunications services and is committed to delivering a fit-for-purpose framework that suitably protects the interests of consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code (TCP Code) provides benchmarks for consumer safeguards in sales and service, contracts, billing, changing suppliers and complaints handling. The TCP Code is designed to protect consumer rights and to make clear the obligations of telephone and internet service providers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Telecommunications (Consumer Complaints Handling) Industry Standard 2018 establishes the rules and guidelines for service providers' complaints handling processes. Service providers must advise customers of their entitlements when lodging a complaint and have a process to manage, monitor, analyse, record and report on the complaints they receive .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information about these and other existing telecommunications consumer protections is available on the website of the communications regulator the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) at www.acma.gov.au/how-law-protects-telecommunications-customers. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consumers who have a concern about their phone or internet service that they are unable to resolve directly with their service provider can seek assistance from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO). The TIO provides a free independent dispute resolution service. The TIO aims to settle disputes in a fair, objective and non-bureaucratic way having regard not only to the law and to good industry practice, but also to what it considers is fair and reasonable. The TIO can be contacted by phone on 1800 062 058 or via its website at www.tio.com.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has been undertaking a comprehensive review of existing telecommunications consumer protections. The safeguards framework is being updated where necessary to reflect the extensive transformation that has occurred over the last 20 years driven by new technologies, increased competition, rapidly changing consumer preferences and the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Consumer Safeguards Review is examining the protections needed to enable consumers to connect to services and have faults repaired in a timely manner; exercise informed choice when selecting products and services; be treated fairly by their service provider; and have access to an effective complaints handling and redress scheme if things go wrong.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The first set of reforms from the review (Part A - complaints handling and redress) are largely complete which include the TIO strengthening its governance, operations and relationship with ACMA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The second tranche of reforms (Part B - service reliability) are being progressed. The Government has recently consulted on proposed new wholesale service reliability rules and ACMA has also consulted on potential future retail level requirements. There is ongoing engagement with industry and consumer groups to inform this work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The final part of the review (Part C - choice and fairness) is looking at choice and fairness in the consumer-telco relationship. This includes looking at telecommunications-specific consumer protection rules and how they are made and enforced. The Government is considering reform options following public consultations. Further information is available at www.communications.gov.au/consumer-safeguards-review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your personal representation, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning petition EN2279, which has called for the compulsory elements of the superannuation system to be brought to a referendum. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no plans to take the compulsory elements of the superannuation system to a referendum. Superannuation and retirement income policy is the responsibility of the elected Government and changes to superannuation law can be appropriately made through the Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the recently released the Retirement Income Review confirmed that "the Australian retirement income system is effective, sound and its costs are broadly sustainable" (page 17 of the Review's report).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Review was prepared by an independent panel and establishes a comprehensive fact base that will improve understanding of how the retirement income system operates, better informing public policy and the retirement outcomes delivered to Australians. The Review can be found on the Treasury website: www.treasury.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing these important issues to the Government's attention. The Government welcomes the petitioners' interest in economic policy and appreciates the consideration that they have given to these matters.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your emails of 19 and 22 March 2021 to Senator the Hon Marise Payne, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, regarding a number of petitions presented to the House of Representatives in relation to international passenger arrival caps and related issues. These include petitions EN2282, EN2328, EN2382, EN2384, EN2361, EN2330 and EN2324. As the matters raised within these petitions fall within my portfolio responsibilities, the petitions were forwarded to me for consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As I advised in my response of 30 March 2021 (Ref: MC21-000165 regarding EN1710) to the Committee, the Australian Government has a taken a number of actions to assist the return of Australians currently overseas including a range of assistance measures available through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since then I can advise that the Australian Government has agreed with the Northern Territory Government to the further expansion of the Howard Springs quarantine facility to accommodate up to 2,000 international passenger arrivals. The Australian Government has also agreed to continue supporting repatriation flights from a number of overseas destinations to Australia, through to the end of 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am also pleased to advise that two-way quarantine free travel commenced between Australia and New Zealand on 19 April 2021. The Trans-Tasman is Australia's busiest international aviation market, with over seven million passengers on the route in the year ending January 2020 before the severe effects of COVID-19 hit international aviation. Other travel corridors will be considered when the health and expert advice says that it is safe to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 March 2021 enclosing Petition EN2283 concerning approval to remove the current exemption process for partners and to remove the weekly arrival caps. Your correspondence was referred to me on 30 March 2021 as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, to protect Australians from the outbreak of COVID-19, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions that limit travel to Australia. Until further notice, there is a prohibition on all foreign nationals seeking to travel to Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories or have been granted an individual exemption by the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Mr Michael Outram APM, or authorised decision-makers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Peter Dutton MP's, response of 25 January 2021, to <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN1896 requesting overseas partners be permitted to return to Australia</span>, immediate family members of Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents, and New Zealand citizens usually resident in Australia, are exempt from Australia's travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Spouses, de facto partners, dependent children and legal guardians are all considered to be immediate family members for the purpose of exemptions to Australia's travel restrictions. Partner (subclasses 100, 309, 801 and 820) and Child (subclasses 101, 102 and 445) visa holders are able to come to Australia and do not need to request an exemption.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Immediate family members who hold a temporary visa, or do not yet hold a valid visa, must provide documentary evidence of their relationship to the Department of Home Affairs for assessment before seeking to travel to Australia. This can be done through the exemption request process via the Department's website at: https://travel-exemptions.homeaffairs.gov.au/tep.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You will also no doubt be aware that the caps on international passenger arrivals is aligned with the number of places available in the mandatory quarantine facilities administered by the state and territory governments. We are looking at how to begin recommencing travel and appreciate the benefits open borders will bring, but it will be a gradual process informed by health advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting the health of Australians and bringing Australians home, especially vulnerable Australians, remains the Government's priority.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 March 2021 enclosing Petition EN2313 concerning seeking the grant of an exemption for a PhD student and their family to travel to Australia. Your correspondence was referred to me on 30 March 2021 as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, to protect Australians from the outbreak of COVID-19, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions that limit travel to Australia. Until further notice, there is a prohibition on all foreign national's seeking to travel to Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories or have been granted an individual exemption by the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Mr Michael Outram APM, or authorised decision-makers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A range of matters are considered in determining if the individual circumstances of an applicant are compassionate and compelling. The circumstances that are generally considered to satisfy the requirements for the approval of an individual exemption are outlined in the Commissioner's Guidelines and the Inward Travel Restrictions Operation Directive available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid 19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The guidelines notes that the Commissioner will personally consider travel exemption requests for people who are enrolled in an Australian education institution as a PhD research student, regardless of the visa type held. Travel exemption requests from a PhD research student should include evidence of support from a relevant Government agency outlining why the research is considered essential and in Australia's national interest and how their role is critical to the research.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence of current enrolment in a University in Australia as a PhD student undertaking research, evidence of current sponsorship or support from the University in Australia and evidence to demonstrate how the student's role is critical to the research should also be included with the travel exemption request for consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is open to the petitioner to submit a further travel exemption request for consideration and include as much supporting information as possible. Without pre-empting a decision, any new request is unlikely to be successful unless significant additional information is provided or the petitioner's circumstances change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge the concerns raised through Petition EN2313, the travel restrictions are in place to manage the health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers. You will also no doubt be aware that bringing Australians home, especially vulnerable Australians, remains the Government's priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2313 to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 March 2021 concerning petition EN2333, requesting Morayfield/Caboolture be recognised as a Distribution Priority Area (DPA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note your concerns and would like to take this opportunity to assure you that the Australian Government is committed to improving access to health services for all Australians - providing quality, safe and affordable health care - regardless of where they live.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government uses the DPA indicator to identify maldistribution of the medical workforce in Australia. The Morayfield/Caboolture area is classified as a non-DPA for GPs and bonded program participants, as it has been assessed as receiving GP services exceeding the benchmark. The DPA system is updated annually. Should there be any substantial changes to health services in the community, this will be reflected in the next update, scheduled for 1 July 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DPA status is used by Commonwealth programs that target doctors to rural areas through location restrictions on their practice, including sl9AB of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Health Insurance Act 1973</span>. This is used to target International Medical Graduates and Foreign Graduates of Accredited Medical Schools to rural areas by providing these doctors with access to Medicare in those areas only. It supports practices by offering access to a broader recruitment pool of doctors in rural areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Modified Monash Model (MMM) MM 2 average of GP services is used as the DPA status benchmark. The national average of access to GP services is used for determining DPA status for the Bonded Medical Program where the DPA is used to identify where doctors with return of service obligations can work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Visas for GPs program supports the distribution of primary health care services in rural Australia. The program aims to manage growth in Australia's medical workforce by regulating the number of overseas trained doctors entering the country seeking to work in the primary health care sector. It redirects overseas trained doctors to areas where there is a need for additional primary health care services. This is generally regional, rural and remote areas, broadly classified as MM 2-7 regions, with DPA status.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The program applies equitably in all areas of Australia, and all employers must obtain a Health Workforce Certificate (Certificate) to sponsor an overseas trained doctor to work in a primary health care position. Certificate assessments are based on the outcome of my Department's Assessment Tool (Tool).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Tool uses an evidence-based approach to identify the need for additional primary health care services in a GP catchment, and assists in identifying areas of greatest need by comparing primary health care services delivered in areas of similar populations. This is based on the following characteristics of the GP catchment:</span>
            </p>

The Assessment Tool outcome shows the GP catchment of Caboolture as having sufficient primary health care services to meet local needs with a 'well above standard' GP Access level compared to catchments with a similar population and service needs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence, originally directed to the Treasurer, with regards to petition number EN2337. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Scheme permits transfers of retirement savings between Australian superannuation funds (excluding self-managed superannuation funds) and New Zealand KiwiSaver schemes. The scheme facilitates consolidation of personal retirement savings (where split across two countries), reduces exposure to multiple sets of fees and charges and enhances labour mobility between the two countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian superannuation fund trustees are obliged to transfer superannuation benefits to New Zealand if the member asks it to. Once the funds are transferred, they are generally subject to New Zealand superannuation rules.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, there are some exceptions to the treatment of superannuation funds transferred to New Zealand. In particular, Australian-sourced retirement savings may not be withdrawn from a KiwiSaver account to purchase a first home. This rule is legislated under New Zealand's <span style="font-style:italic;">KiwiSaver Act 2006</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The exemption to the KiwiSaver first home withdrawal rules is consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding, 'Arrangement Between The Government of Australia and The Government of New Zealand on Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability', and further noted in the Explanatory Memorandum for Superannuation Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Arrangement) Bill 2012.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring that Australian-sourced retirement savings are not used for purposes outside of retirement income preserves the integrity of the Australian superannuation system. Permitting the early withdrawal of superannuation funds once transferred to the New Zealand system would undermine the Australian system's preservation rules. These preservation requirements ensure that superannuation funds are available for the purpose of providing income in retirement. It should also be noted that as superannuation contributions receive generous tax concessions to encourage people to save for retirement, the purchase of housing in New Zealand would not align with the purpose of these concessions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on the rules for the transfer of retirement funds between Australia and New Zealand can be found on the Australian Taxation Office website: www.ato.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 122 of the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws in relation to territories which have been 'surrendered' by the states or which have otherwise been acquired by the Commonwealth. In relation to these territories (of which there are currently 10), the Commonwealth Parliament can make laws on any subject, and may also allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. The Commonwealth Parliament has conferred a large measure of self-government on the people of 2 of the territories, namely the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory, with some exceptions, such as those to which the petition refers. In these territories, a range of governmental matters are now handled by a locally-elected parliament. The Parliament has also provided for the representation of those territories in the House of Representatives and Senate.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While I note the concerns raised in the petition, the Government is not presently proposing changes to section 122 of the Constitution. Section 128 requires that a referendum be held to make any alteration to the Constitution. In order to be effective, a proposed amendment of the Constitution must be approved at a national referendum by a majority of voters overall and by majorities in a majority of States (that is, in 4 of the 6 states). This mechanism ensures that only those referendum proposals with very widespread support can succeed.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2373 on retail fuel price cycles. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to continue to monitor fuel prices in Australia. In its recent reports, the ACCC has found that the key factors affecting fuel prices remain international crude oil and exchange rates. For example, increases in international oil prices typically lead to increases in domestic petrol prices. Its most recent report can be found at: www.accc.gov.au/media-release/petrol-prices-ended-bumpy-year-slightly-lower-as-demand-rebounded.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Motorists, particularly in major cities, can also make savings by avoiding buying petrol at the peak of petrol price cycles. Petrol price cycles occur when prices oscillate between high and low points. Typically, prices steadily fall for a period followed by a sharp increase. The ACCC's website provides information on petrol prices cycles and gives buying tips: www.accc. gov.au/consumers/petrol-diesel-lpg/petrol-price-cycles#petrol-price-cycles-in-capital-cities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The level of competition between fuel retailers is also very important. To help drive competition, the ACCC recommends that consumers take advantage of fuel price websites and mobile applications that allow them to select the best time to purchase fuel, as well as the cheapest location.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021 to the former Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the Hon Stuart Robert MP, providing EN2380 under Standing Order 209(a) and (b). As the Minister now responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), I am providing a written response to this petition to be considered by the Standing Committee on Petitions (the Committee).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's consistent position is that the use of NDIS funds to pay for the services of a sex worker is not in line with community expectations or in line with the broader intent of the NDIS. The Government considers that, as for any other person, the cost of sexual services for an NDIS participant should come from their general income, which may include income support provided by the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to assure you that it is not intended to restrict the ability of the NDIS to fund other supports that could assist a person to express their sexuality and develop sexual relationships for the purposes of procreation, pleasure or intimacy. It is also not intended to prevent the NDIS from providing funding for other supports that enable people with disability to have control over, choice about, and access to services pertaining to their sexuality and ability to exercise sexual rights and freedoms to live an 'ordinary life'. Rather, the intent of the exclusion is only to cover paid sex work or a support that uses a device for a similar purpose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 March 2021 concerning petition number EN2386.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is considering mechanisms for recognising an international immunisation certificate for COVID-19, and potential alternative entry and quarantine arrangements for returning Australians who may have been vaccinated, if it is safe to do so. These considerations are based on the expert medical advice on vaccination effectiveness and on how best to manage the ongoing risk of transmission :from international arrivals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this time, the Government does not consider vaccination status to be a complete or sufficient substitute for other biosecurity measures, such as quarantine and testing requirements, which remain in place to minimise COVID-19 health risks associated with international travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This position aligns with the current advice provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and takes into account the lack of data, as to whether the COVID-19 vaccines prevent vaccinated individuals transmitting the virus to others.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This position is continually reviewed against expert advice provided by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and considering up-to-date international public health information outlined by the WHO. If favourable data on vaccination continues to be published over time, then this may trigger a decision as to whether there should be a scaling-back of other public-health interventions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is possible that, in the future, vaccination against COVID-19 might become a requirement for travel to certain destinations. Where COVID-19 vaccination is made mandatory, there will be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021 enclosing Petition EN2396 concerning approval, to exempt partners and dependent children of temporary visa holders in Australia from the travel restrictions for travel to Australia. Your correspondence was referred to me on 30 March 2021 as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Peter Dutton MP's, correspondence of 3 February 2021, to <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN1893 allow temporary visa holders be permitted to return to Australia</span>, under the current travel exemptions policy settings, consideration is given to travel exemption requests from family members of temporary visa holders in Australia who may have a critical skill, and where there is a risk the person will depart if they are unable to reunite with their family. Consideration is also given to exemption requests from families where a minor is in Australia and was lawfully present in Australia before the restrictions came into effect.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge the difficulties with respect to temporary resident families seeking to reunite in Australia, the current travel restrictions are in place to manage the health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers, and generally do not support travel for the purpose of family reunification in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this time, there are no plans to broaden the existing exemption categories to include partners and dependent children of temporary visa holders in Australia. Due to the limited quarantine capacity across all states and territories, and associated restrictions on international flight numbers, it is imperative that international travel into Australia is limited to journeys that are for exceptional circumstances only as per the current exemption categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting the health of Australians and bringing Australians home, especially vulnerable Australians, remains the Australian Government's priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You will also no doubt be aware that temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to depart Australia. It is open to the temporary visa holder separated from their family to depart Australia to reunite with them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to recent correspondence regarding Petition Number EN0493. This petition draws to the attention of the House concerns regarding alleged organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights, including freedom of religion and freedom of belief for all people. We remain deeply concerned about reports of serious human rights abuses, including the targeting of religious groups in China. We have consistently raised our concerns about this issue directly with China, including at ministerial level, and in relevant international forums, and will continue to do so .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of reports of illegal organ harvesting in China. Australia strongly opposes the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners for use in medical transplants, which we are aware have occurred in China, at least prior to 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is carefully monitoring developments on this issue, and regularly reviews available evidence as new reports are published. This includes the reports of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to the prevention of organ trafficking globally. The Government has had a comprehensive strategy since 2004 to combat such crimes and is committed to ensuring that Australia's response to organ trafficking and transplant tourism remains as effective as possible. In addition, Australia's States and Territories have robust frameworks in place to regulate lawful donation and transplants of human organs and tissue for therapeutic purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the petition's call to sanction Chinese officials believed to be involved in the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners through visa bans, the Government retains the ability to prevent individuals involved in human rights abuses from visiting Australia under the Migration Act. We regularly review our sanctions settings to ensure they remain suitable and effective.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We will continue to closely monitor all reports of mistreatment and restrictions against religious groups in China, and seek opportunities to respond strongly where we have human rights concerns.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 24 February 2021 concerning Petition PN0497 requesting Australia Post take action to keep the Sebastopol Licenced Post Office open.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post is an independent Government Business Enterprise, both legally and financially separate from the Australian Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petition relates to an operational matter, I have sought advice from Australia Post. The Licensee at the Sebastopol Licensed Post Office made the decision to relocate their business on 6 February 2021 from Albert Street, Sebastopol, to the Delacombe Town Centre, approximately 3.9 kilometres away. This relocation enables the Licensee to operate out of larger premises and to better support growth in the surrounding area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the petition Australia Post has reviewed the request, considering a number of factors such as the location and viability of other nearby post offices, changes in the population, and the volume of business expected to be transacted at nearby outlets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post advised that the Sebastopol community will continue to be well serviced by the Mt Clear and Rodan Licensed Post Offices which are located within approximately 3 kilometres of the Albert Street location. To re-tender this location to a new Licensee would more than likely render either or both of these outlets financially unviable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post exceeds its regulatory obligations for post offices under the Australian Postal Corporation (Performance Standards) Regulations 2019, with approximately 4,330 retail outlets across Australia (4,000 required). Within this total, Australia Post maintains 2,520 in rural and remote areas (2,500 required). It also exceeds proximity requirements, with 93.7 per cent of metropolitan residences being within 2.5 kilometres of an outlet (90 per cent required) and 88.8 per cent of non-metropolitan residences within 7.5 kilometres of an outlet (85 per cent required). Sebastopol is classified as a non-metropolitan area.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns of the Sebastopol community to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope the information in this letter is of some help.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 March 2021 enclosing Petition PN0500 concerning release of asylum seekers from detention into the community. Your correspondence was referred to me on 30 March 2021 as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the concerns raised in Petition PN0500 requesting the release of all the asylum seekers from detention and providing them with adequate means of support. I can assure you that Australia takes its international obligations seriously and provides protection to individuals consistent with all international human rights conventions to which it is a party. Australia is one of the world's most generous contributors to international refugee resettlement efforts, successfully settling more than 900,000 refugees and others in humanitarian need since the end of World War II. We are also one of only a small number of countries that operate well-established and successful resettlement programs and are consistently ranked within the world's top three resettlement countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</span> and its 1967 Protocol. Regional processing arrangements provide illegal maritime arrivals (IMAs) an opportunity to have their protection claims assessed and for those found to be refugees, resettlement in a third country, without compromising Australia's strong border protection policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regional processing is a key pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders and supports the Australian Government's strong border protection policies. These policies have successfully stemmed the flow of illegal maritime ventures to Australia, disrupted people smuggling activities in the region and prevented loss of life at sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The success of Australia's border protection policies has also enabled the Government to make a generous contribution to addressing the global humanitarian crisis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's strong border protection policies and associated management of transitory persons under regional processing arrangements has not changed - IMAs will not be settled in Australia. Consistent with this position, transitory persons brought to Australia from a regional processing country, whether for medical treatment or as accompanying family, are in Australia for a temporary purpose only.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons under regional processing arrangements, including those temporarily in Australia, have permanent resettlement options and are being resettled. Transitory persons can seek to resettle in the United States (US) or another third country, settle in Papua New Guinea, or voluntarily return home or to another country in which they have a right of entry. Transitory persons are encouraged to engage in third country resettlement options and take steps to start the next phase of their lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A total of 4,183 IMAs were transferred to offshore processing under the previous government. Today, there are no refugees in detention under offshore processing and as at 31 January 2021, 913 refugees have been resettled under the Government's resettlement arrangement with the US.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span>, detention is not limited by a set timeframe; rather, it ends when the person either is granted a visa or is removed from Australia. This is dependent upon a number of factors, including identity determination, developments in country information and the complexity of processing due to individual circumstances relating to health, character or security matters. Notwithstanding this, these assessments are completed as expeditiously as possible to facilitate the shortest possible timeframe for detaining. people in immigration detention facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The lengths and conditions of immigration detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation and services provided, are subject to regular review by senior officers of the Department of Home Affairs, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Human Rights Commission. These reviews consider the lawfulness and appropriateness of a person's detention, their detention arrangements and placement, health and welfare and other matters relevant to their ongoing detention and case resolution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals who are actively engaged with the Department to resolve their immigration status and need assistance to overcome barriers to that resolution, have access to a range of services offered by the Government such as Medicare and the public health system, education for school-aged children, assistance with finding employment (if they have work rights), and, if eligible, the Government's Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS) Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SRSS Program provides short-term, tailored support to individuals who have demonstrated barriers to resolving their immigration status. Please note that this is not a social welfare program and eligibility for the SRSS Program is regularly reviewed and assessed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's preference in every case is for foreign nationals who do not hold a valid visa and who have exhausted all outstanding avenues to remain in Australia, to depart voluntarily on their own accord. Those unwilling to depart voluntarily will be subject to detention and removal from Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition PN0500 to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 regarding Petition EN1942 which asks the House to not utilise a gas-led economic recovery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, my priority is to bring energy prices down and keep the lights on, while meeting Australia's emissions reduction commitments. Australia's competitive advantage has always been based on cheap energy, and gas will be central to our ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Gas plays an important role in our everyday lives, from cooking to providing hot water and heating our homes. Many businesses rely on gas as an essential input to their operations, with gas accounting for 40 per cent of final energy demand in the manufacturing sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Gas also plays an important role in ensuring the reliability of our electricity grid. Australia's energy system is now made up of record levels of renewable resources, like solar and wind. We are projected to deploy an additional 24GW of rooftop solar by 2030, tripling the nation's rooftop solar capacity over the decade. In 2019, Australia was deploying new renewable energy l0 times faster per capita than the global average and 4 times faster per capita than Europe, China, Japan or the US. These are achievements Australians can be proud of</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the key challenge to ensuring continued strong growth in new renewable capacity is to provide backup for when the sun isn't shining and when the wind isn't blowing. We need more flexible backup generation and storage - gas, pumped hydro and batteries - to balance and integrate high shares of renewable energy. According to Australia's former Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, the adoption of renewable electricity will be faster and more reliable if gas-fired generation remains available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Gas infrastructure, such as pipelines, will also be critical to the roll-out of new energy technologies, such as hydrogen. The Government has announced a $1.9 billion investment package and a Technology Investment Roadmap to enable the deployment of new low-emissions technologies that will work with gas to support economic growth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Gas also produces fewer emissions than coal and will help support our commitments under the Paris Agreement. The recently published Australia's emissions projections 2020 report shows that Australia is on track to beat its 2030 target by 403 million tonnes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Liberal National Government's priority is bringing power prices down and keeping the lights on by implementing its plan for a Fair Deal on Energy. We have seen 19 straight months of year-on-year falls in wholesale electricity prices, and eight consecutive quarters of retail price reductions. These low prices are forecast to continue on the back of policy action from the Government to lower energy costs and improve outcomes for families and small businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Coal-fired electricity generation will continue to play an important role in our electricity system for some time. The 'dispatchability' of coal is vital to maintain balance in our electricity system and ensure Australian households and businesses have affordable, reliable power.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is encouraging investment in new generation to improve reliability and put downward pressure on electricity prices. This includes work through the Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) program, the Supporting Reliable Energy Infrastructure (SREI) program, establishing the $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund and the Government's 1000 MW dispatchable capacity target in NSW.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The UNGI program is a key part of our plan to deliver affordable and reliable power. We are focused on working with a number of shortlisted projects, including new gas generators, with the potential to provide reliable, dispatchable electricity when needed. Through the SREI program, we approved a $3.31 million grant to support a feasibility study of a proposed 1000 MW high efficiency, low emissions coal plant in Collinsville, Queensland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With the upcoming closure of the Liddell Power Station in NSW, the Government has set energy companies a target to commit, by the end of April 2021, to building 1000 megawatts of dispatchable capacity that will come online by the summer of 2023-24.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding Petition No. EN2134 to 'recognise the fundamental right to self-determination of the indigenous Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns of the Armenian-Australian community regarding the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Like the signatories of the petition, Australia was very concerned by the fighting in the region last year and the significant loss of life on both sides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We call on both sides to engage with the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs and work towards a lasting peace. This should be based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of the non-use of force, territorial integrity and the equal rights and self-determination of peoples and be guided by the 'Madrid Principles' proposed by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has long held a position of supporting the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group to negotiate a permanent settlement of the conflict. We consider the three-nation ceasefire agreement that took effect on 10 November 2020 provides an opportunity to achieve such an outcome.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 regarding Petition number EN2135.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition requested the House to continue efforts in Afghanistan, specifically to 'work with the United Nations to ensure that Afghan women are integral to the peace process and achieving lasting peace. Prioritise Australian aid funding for education and training for young Afghans to be part of rebuilding Afghanistan. Negotiate with US President-elect and his administration for a commitment towards a durable peace.'</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to provide further information regarding the diplomatic efforts and development assistance Australia is providing to support Afghanistan and its journey to sustainable peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Empowering women has been a strong focus of Australia's diplomatic, military and development cooperation with Afghanistan since 2001. Through our whole-of-government engagement, we continue to promote women as key agents of change, and encourage their full, equal, and meaningful participation and leadership in peace, security and stability decision-making.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia promotes the inclusion of women in all forms of peace dialogue and formal negotiations, and amplifies the voices of Afghan women through our political advocacy and support in multilateral fora. We are building capacity to support security, law, and justice sector efforts to meet the needs and rights of women and girls. Australia is also mainstreaming gender equality and the 'women, peace and security' agenda into our development and humanitarian activities funded by the Australian aid program. Some examples of this work are outlined below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the global level:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia played an active role in the drafting and adoption of two UN Security Council resolutions on 'women, peace and security', and advocated for a priority focus on women and girls in a resolution on Afghanistan, during our term on the UN Security Council (2012-13).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Most recently (March 2020), Australia supported UN Security Council Resolution 2513 on Afghanistan, which affirms that any political settlement must protect the rights of all Afghans, including women, youth and minorities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia has also supported the adoption of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)'s General Recommendation 30 (2013) that provides instruction on the protection and promotion of the rights of women and girls in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia has also promoted the rights of women and girls by leading and co-sponsoring a number of resolutions and statements as a member of the Human Rights Council (2018-2020} with Afghanistan.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia, as co-chair of the new Friends of Afghan Women Ambassadors' Group in Kabul, continues to advocate for the active and meaningful participation of Afghan women and the protection of women's rights in the peace process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia has joined various joint declarations on the promotion of women's rights, 'women, peace and security', and security concerns over civilian causalities and the impact on women and children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's Ending Violence Against Women Program ($22.5 million, 2012-21) is raising awareness on women's rights in Islam and Afghanistan's Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Australia is supporting the training of community and faith leaders to challenge harmful gender norms in society, and encourage women's engagement in political and economic affairs. The program's impact is demonstrating that better-informed religious and community leaders can become gender-conscious mediators and advocates for women's rights, and highlighting the crucial role of men and boys in combatting violence against women and girls.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Our Empowerment through Education program ($20.7 million, 2011-20), delivered by CARE Afghanistan, fills a gap in basic education across five Afghan provinces, particularly targeting girls in remote and rural communities. The program includes peace education, and new 'women, peace and security' curriculum currently under development.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's Regional Humanitarian Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan prioritises support to women, and Australia's support to UN Population Fund is delivering important sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services to Afghan women and girls in areas with high numbers of refugee returns and conflict displacement.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australian funding to UN Development Programme is promoting equitable and just dispute resolution mechanisms for Afghan women. This includes supporting an assessment of the prevalence of gender-based violence across Afghanistan during COVID-19 lockdown, and piloting innovative approaches to target the root causes of family violence and increasing survivors' access to support services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Australian Embassy in Kabul public diplomacy platform, @AusEmbAfg on Twitter, has ramped up 'women, peace and security'-related content and messaging throughout 2020. Twitter Posts on women's rights, protection and engagement make up approximately 60 per cent of all content, and receive widespread positive responses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regards to the peace process, Australia, along with the international community, welcomes the Afghanistan Peace Negotiations, which commenced on 12 September 2020. Australia acknowledges there will be challenges on the long road to peace, but we see an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned political settlement as the only viable way to resolve the conflict.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 23 January 2021, the United States announced that it was reviewing the US-Taliban agreement, to ensure the Taliban were living up to their commitments. Progress towards the May 2021 withdrawal of foreign military forces is based on the Taliban's compliance with the US-Taliban agreement signed in February 2020. The United States and NATO have both emphasised that they have not yet decided on a final withdrawal timeframe.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue to work closely with the United States and the broader international community to support an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process. I thank you for your interest in this issue and support for our efforts.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning petition EN2192 the restrictions placed on citizens or resident who refuse a COVID-19 vaccine. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing a safe and effective vaccine to everyone living in Australia. The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation in that it is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. While the Government supports immunisation, it is not mandatory and individuals maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 vaccines will not be mandatory in Australia, but it's important that everyone who can get it, does get it, to help keep themselves and others safe. Achieving community protection through immunisation would see people connecting with family and friends, transitioning back to their workplaces, and with time, a restart of our job market - all vital components to improving the lives of many Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no mandatory vaccines in Australia, it's possible that in the future, vaccination against COVID-19 might become a requirement for travel to certain destinations or for people working in certain high-risk workplaces. If this becomes the case, there will be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in Australia is being guided by the medical experts of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). ATAGI has developed resources for patients and providers to help with providing informed consent to get a COVID-19 vaccination, including an optional consent forms. As with all other vaccines, valid consent is required before administering each dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If people choose not to have a COVID-19 vaccine, this will not affect their family's eligibility for Family Tax Benefit Part A or childcare fee assistance which only includes National Immunisation Program vaccines for those aged younger than 20.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">States and territories are able to issue public health directions requiring individuals to be vaccinated, as is the case where individuals entering aged care facilities must be vaccinated against influenza, except if vaccination is not available to the person or they have a medical contraindication. Similarly, workplace occupational health and safety is a matter for individual employers, providers and under model work health safety laws, employers are required to manage risks of viral exposure and infection, and persons at a workplace are required to comply, so far as they are reasonably able, with any reasonable instruction in that regard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are encouraged to rely on reputable sources of information to help them make informed choices and stay up to date.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Most recently, I joined New Zealand Foreign Minister, the Hon Nanaia Mahuta, on 23 March, in a joint statement expressing the concerns of both our governments about human rights abuses including reports of arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of religion, pervasive surveillance and forced labour, as well as recent disturbing reports of systematic torture and abuse of Uighur women.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has raised Australia's serious concerns about Xinjiang at the last eight sessions of the UN Human Rights Council and joined a 39-country statement delivered in the UNGA Third Committee in New York regarding Xinjiang and Hong Kong on 6 October 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We continue to call on China to give international observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang at the earliest opportunity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government regularly raises directly with China, and in the UN, our concerns about the human rights situations in Tibet and policies targeting Falun Gong practitioners. The Government is aware of reports of illegal organ harvesting in China. Australia strongly opposes the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners for use in medical transplants, which we are aware have occurred in China, at least prior to 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to the prevention of organ trafficking globally. The Government has had a comprehensive strategy since 2004 to combat such crimes and is committed to ensuring that Australia's response to organ trafficking and transplant tourism remains as effective as possible . In addition, Australia's states and territories have robust frameworks in place to regulate lawful donation and transplants of human organs and tissue for therapeutic purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government retains the ability to prevent individuals involved in human rights abuses from visiting Australia under the Migration Act. We regularly review our sanctions settings to ensure they remain suitable and effective.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also expressed its deep concerns to China about its recent moves to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, democratic principles, and rule of law. We have suspended our extradition agreement with Hong Kong, introduced new visa measures for temporary graduates and skilled workers from Hong Kong wanting to live and work in Australia, and updated our travel advice to reflect the new risks to Australians in Hong Kong .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing the petitioners concerns to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 referring petition EN2246 titled <span style="font-style:italic;">455 Too Many: Address and Investigate Indigenous Deaths in Custody</span>. I appreciate the signatories taking the time to petition the Australian Government on this important issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to finding effective solutions to address the drivers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' disproportionate contact with the justice system. As the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found, the fundamental issue is that "too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often". Reducing the number of Indigenous Australians in contact with the justice system, through addressing the underlying factors that lead to offending, will reduce the number of Indigenous deaths in custody.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An independent review by Deloitte Access Economics in 2018 found significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission. The review found that of the 339 recommendations, 78 per cent had been fully or mostly implemented and 16 per cent had been partially implemented. The review also found that of the 223 recommendations for which the Australian Government had responsibility, 91 per cent had been fully or mostly implemented.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As states and territories are responsible for their police and justice systems, mental fitness assessments for police officers and corrections staff are a matter for the states and territories. I encourage the petitioners to contact their state and territory governments with regards to this issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to continuing to work with states and territories, Indigenous Australians and communities to continue to address the findings of the Royal Commission. The National Agreement on Closing the Gap (the National Agreement) is an important framework for continuing to progress this important work. Through the National Agreement, the Australian Government is considering how the remaining recommendations from the Royal Commission can be brought into effect, as we work towards the two justice targets (Target 10 to reduce adult incarceration and Target 11 to reduce youth detention).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This National Agreement is also an important opportunity, particularly for states and territories who have responsibility for their police, judicial and correction systems, to consider issues such as those raised in the petition, including justice reinvestment programs and further training and support for police and corrections officers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All governments have worked in partnership with the Coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak organisations to develop the new National Agreement, which outlines a new way of working, with shared decision making, shared responsibility and shared accountability to close the gap. The National Agreement sets out ambitious targets and new Priority Reforms that will change the way governments work to improve life outcomes experienced by Indigenous Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Action on targets in addition to Targets 10 and 11, in the agreement will also help prevent Indigenous Australians having contact with the justice system. These include strengthening families to ensure parents and children are safe, ensuring young people are engaged meaningfully in education, adults are employed and all people have good health and wellbeing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, under Priority Reform One of the National Agreement, all parties have committed to establish a justice policy partnership to identify opportunities to work more effectively across governments, reduce gaps and duplication and improve outcomes under Closing the Gap. This policy partnership, to be developed through the Joint Council on Closing the Gap and will be critical to helping meet the adult and youth justice targets. A copy of the National Agreement is available at https://closingthegap.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may be interested to know about actions already underway that aim to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and divert Indigenous Australians from the justice system. As part of the Morrison Government's commitment to work with states and territories, we have committed $261.3 million in 2020-21 to fund a range of activities to complement efforts by states and territories to improve justice and community safety outcomes for Indigenous Australians. These activities aim to promote Indigenous women's safety and leadership; improve wellbeing; create safe and functional environments; improve community safety in remote Indigenous communities; reduce alcohol and other drug misuse; reduce re-offending; and reduce family violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government has also offered to fund the establishment of a Custody Notification Service in each state and territory as an important safeguard recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, to reduce the likelihood of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody. The services provide culturally appropriate health and welfare support and basic legal advice for Indigenous Australians detained by police. Australian Government funded Custody Notification Services are operational in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Victoria, with a service soon to be established in South Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian governments are working towards the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). A key obligation under OPCAT is to establish National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) to inspect primary places of detention (including police cells, adult correctional facilities and youth justice facilities), prevent torture and ill-treatment, and improve the treatment of people in detention. Implementing OPCAT will have benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under OPCAT, jurisdictions will be obliged to take a proactive approach in regularly monitoring and inspecting places of detention with an aim to prevent torture and ill-treatment. This obligation will result in jurisdictions taking positive steps to improve the conditions in detention while also potentially uncovering previously unidentified issues across the criminal justice system. NPMs could not only advocate for people in detention, but the practical effect of NPMs regularly monitoring conditions in detention is likely to result in overall improvements. This could include improvements to processes and procedures, greater general supports, and better access to medical and mental health care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring this petition to me. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 15 March 2021 regarding Petition Number EN2306 on Australia's engagement in the United Nations and the Paris Agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's national interests, security and prosperity are served by a stable international order based on pragmatic and principled international cooperation among sovereign states. COVID-19 has demonstrated that the international order, underpinned by the agencies and bodies of the United Nations, is vital to address and coordinate a global response to a global challenge.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's international engagement is guided by our national interests, including both our bilateral and multilateral engagement. The 2020 audit of Australia's engagement with the United Nations affirmed that multilateral institutions create rules that are vital to Australia's security, interests, values and prosperity. These institutions regulate international cooperation in key sectors including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications and agriculture , among others, and promote universal values, such as human rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change requires a global solution, with countries acting together to reduce emissions. Australia is committed to the Paris Agreement, the central international agreement on climate change which seeks to limit global warming. The Paris Agreement has near-universal support, with 191 parties having ratified or accepted the Agreement and having put forward emissions reductions commitments under the Agreement. Australia has welcomed the United States decision to re-join the Agreement in February 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is an active and constructive participant in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, where we are working alongside other countries to pursue strong transparency requirements for all countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to meeting its Paris Agreement target to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Australia beat its 2020 target by 459 million tonnes and we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris target.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is taking real and meaningful action to reduce emissions, with more than $5.6 billion committed to new emissions reduction measures through the last two federal Budgets. Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap will guide $18 billion of Government investment over the next 10 years to leverage $70 billion of new investment in Australia in low emissions technologies by 2030. Our plan will support 130,000 jobs by 2030 and avoid in the order of 250 million tonnes of emissions by 2040.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Investing in low emissions technologies will enable Australia's continued success in meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets. I assure the petitioners of Australia's continued commitment to influence and shape global institutions, while also safeguarding Australia's national interests.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 March 2021 enclosing Petition EN2311 concerning seeking inclusion of parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents as immediate family members for the purpose of exemption from Australia's travel restrictions. Your correspondence was referred to me on 30 March 2021 as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in the correspondence to you of 25 January 2021 from the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Peter Dutton MP, in response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN1860 Inclusion of Parents as "Immediate" family members for travel exemption</span>, broadening the definition of immediate family members and including any additional exempt categories will be a process informed by expert health advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I sympathise with those who haven't been able to see their loved ones for extended periods of time, these restrictions are in place to manage the health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers and generally do not support travel for the purpose of family reunification.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You will no doubt be aware that protecting the health of Australians and bringing Australians home, especially vulnerable Australians, remains the Australian Government's priority. Due to the limited quarantine capacity across all states and territories, and associated restrictions on international flight numbers, it is imperative that international travel into Australia is limited to journeys that are for exceptional circumstances only.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your emails of 22 March 2021, regarding Petition Nos. EN2347, EN2354 and EN2377, which relate to protest action by farmers in India.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">India is an important partner for Australia, as demonstrated by the elevation of the bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in June 2020. People-to-people linkages underpin the relationship, and I welcome the initiative of these petitioners in contributing their views.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has long highlighted the benefits of economic and trade liberalisation to the Indian Government. We also continue to advocate to India on the need for domestic laws, including agriculture regulations, being WTO-consistent. We are following India's economic reform agenda closely.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a strong advocate for human rights and the democratic right to peaceful protest. We expect all countries to maintain public safety while upholding citizens' rights.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring the Petition No. EN2374 of 22 March 2021on the situation in Myanmar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has been a longstanding supporter of Myanmar's democratic transition and its peace process, and we share the grave concerns of those that have signed the petition. Australia has repeatedly condemned the use of lethal force and violence against civilians peacefully protesting and strongly urged the Myanmar security forces to exercise restraint, release all those arbitrarily detained and return Myanmar to the path of democratic transition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to escalating violence, I announced on 7 March the suspension of Australia's bilateral Defence Cooperation Program with Myanmar's military. Australia's development program is also being re-directed to meet the immediate needs of the most vulnerable. We continue to keep our sanctions regime under review, noting it already prohibits supplying weapons to Myanmar and imposes targeted sanctions on a number of individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue to play a constructive role, including in consultation with international partners, particularly ASEAN, in support of the people of Myanmar.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2381 which requests that the stimulus packages for COVID-19 be revised to apply a levy to companies that collected JobKeeper payments with no chance of reduced income. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the face of COVID-19, the Australian Government's emergency support provided a crucial lifeline to households and businesses through an exceptionally difficult period. It was designed to support businesses to retain jobs and manage short-term cash flow challenges, provide support to individuals, severely affected communities and regions, and to ensure the continued flow of credit in the Australian economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Today, the economy has recovered strongly and Australia has seen employment go above its pre-pandemic levels. The Treasurer recently delivered the 2021-22 Budget which outlines the Government's plan to secure Australia's economic recovery and to build jobs. Key elements of this plan are: personal income tax cuts, business tax incentives, new apprenticeships and training places, more infrastructure, and record funding for schools, hospitals, aged care, mental health and the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I highlight some key points of relevance to the Petition EN2381 below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support business investment and the post-COVID19 economic recovery, the Government introduced temporary full expensing and temporary loss carry-back in the 2020-21 Budget. These measures were both extended by one year in the 2021-22 Budget. Temporary full expensing will now allow eligible businesses to deduct the full cost of eligible assets of any value purchased from 7:30pm (AEDT) on 6 October 2020 and first used or installed ready for use by 30 June 2023. Temporary loss carry-back will now allow companies with turnover below $5 billion to recoup tax previously paid on prior year profits, as far back as the 2018-19 income year, using 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, or 2022-23 tax losses. Around 3.6 million businesses (over 99 per cent of businesses), employing around 11.5 million people are eligible to benefit from temporary full expensing, while approximately 1 million companies employing up to 8.8 million people are eligible to benefit from temporary loss carry back. These measures, including the extensions, are estimated to create around 60,000 jobs by the end of 2022-23 and boost GDP by around $2.5 billion in 2020-21, $7.5 billion in 2021-22 and $8 billion in 2022-23.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to reducing taxes for Australians. The petition mentions that the tax free threshold for individuals should be increased to $40,000 until 2024. Increasing the tax-free threshold would benefit all taxpayers regardless of their taxable income and would not necessarily target those that have been the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2021-22 Budget, the Government delivered $7.8 billion in personal income tax cuts to support more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners by retaining the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO) for an additional year. The LMITO is worth up to $1,080 for individuals and $2,160 for dual-income households. This additional support builds on the $25.1 billion of announced tax cuts already flowing to households in 2021-22 through the Government's legislated Personal Income Tax Plan.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">JobKeeper Payment</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobKeeper kept 3.8 million people in their jobs. The petition outlined that many larger companies received the JobKeeper support, yet are not required to repay the Government, despite remaining in a profitable position. I note that the JobKeeper Payment was a wage subsidy made to eligible businesses and not-for­profits affected by COVID-19 to support them in retaining employees. It was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale, which is why it was important that the eligibility criteria were as straightforward as possible, drawing upon existing tax and revenue concepts and definitions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Eligibility for JobKeeper initially used a projected decline in turnover test to ensure that businesses received support, before they incurred large-scale losses from the impacts of COVID-19, which compromised their viability, and before they were in a position where they needed to separate from their staff. In many instances where there was a significant difference between a publicly listed company's projected GST turnover and what eventuated, the ATO made further enquiries to ascertain whether the projection was reasonable at the point in time that it was calculated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Modifying the eligibility criteria to include a measure of the profitability of a business would have introduced significant complexity and delays in the program. In addition, I note that programs that are most comparable to JobKeeper, such as in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Canada also have no formal restrictions relating to dividends or bonuses paid to executives. Such a test would have been difficult to design and implement with integrity on the scale required, given the variety in business models and structures across industries, and given the flexibility that businesses have in the management of their balance sheet. While there may have been merit in considering such design elements if JobKeeper was intended to be an ongoing program, it is less clear that this would have been feasible or desirable in the context.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there is no obligation for businesses who received a JobKeeper Payment or JobKeeper payments to repay those amounts, they may choose to voluntarily pay an amount which is equivalent to some or all of the JobKeeper Payment or payments they received. More information on voluntary repayments can be found here: www.ato.gov.au/General/JobKeeper-Payment/Employers/JobKeeper-voluntary-repayments/.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for your correspondence. Receiving ideas and insights from members of the public plays an important role in informing the Government's plans for a stronger economy.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2437 on tobacco taxation. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government discourages the use of all tobacco products as there is no form of tobacco use which has benign health effects for consumers. Despite the recent decline in the incidence of smoking, it remains a leading cause of preventable death and disability in Australia, with smoking estimated to have killed almost 21,000 Australians in 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organisation identifies price increases through taxation as one of the most effective ways governments can reduce tobacco consumption. Successive governments have made significant efforts in recent years to reduce tobacco consumption through staged increases in tobacco excise and a swap to wage indexation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Tobacco rates are indexed biannually to an index of average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) on 1 March and 1 September every year. In addition to this, in the 2016-17 Budget the Government announced four annual 12.5 per cent rate increases occurring on 1 September every year from 2017 to 2020 inclusive. This continued a series of annual 12.5 per cent increases since December 2013.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The taxation of tobacco products, apart from discouraging smoking, helps to pay for support for people who wish to quit smoking, essential services such as the delivery of health services and other areas of spending that benefit the whole Australian community.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to recent correspondence regarding Petition Number PN0499 and Petition Number PN050l . This petition draws to the attention of the House concerns regarding alleged organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China .</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights, including freedom of religion and freedom of belief for all people. We remain deeply concerned about reports of serious human rights abuses, including the targeting of religious groups in China. We have consistently raised our concerns about this issue directly with China, including at ministerial level, and in relevant international forums, and will continue to do so.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of reports of illegal organ harvesting in China. Australia strongly opposes the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners for use in medical transplants, which we are aware have occurred in China, at least prior to 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is carefully monitoring developments on this issue, and regularly reviews available evidence as new reports are published .

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to the prevention of organ trafficking globally. The Government has had a comprehensive strategy since 2004 to combat such crimes and is committed to ensuring that Australia's response to organ trafficking and transplant tourism remains as effective as possible. In addition, Australia's States and Territories have robust frameworks in place to regulate lawful donation and transplants of human organs and tissue for therapeutic purposes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the petition's call to sanction Chinese officials believed to be involved in the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners through visa bans, the Government retains the ability to prevent individuals involved in human rights abuses from visiting Australia under the Migration Act . We regularly review our sanctions settings to ensure they remain suitable and effective.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1817 - Disability support pensions eligible for mortgage. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions on to whom and when to lend are ultimately commercial decisions for banks, and the Australian Government does not have any power to intervene in these specific decisions. However, the Government considers it important that those consumers and businesses with good credit profiles are able to access the finance they need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Banks have strengthened their lending standards in recent years in response to specific measures taken by regulators to improve lending practices and limit systemic risks. This has coincided with a moderation in lending, particularly to investors and for interest-only loans. However, recent regulatory actions concerning lending policies were designed with the intent to limit risks to the financial system and broader economy, not to unfairly restrict the ability of particular groups of consumers to access credit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of recent anecdotal reports that, given the current level of public scrutiny of their past lending practices, banks have become overly cautious in how they are interpreting the application of existing legal and prudential obligations on their lending. In response, the Treasurer has stated publicly that while banks must adhere to regulatory standards, consideration should also be given to the need to provide access to finance for families and businesses, thus facilitating a critical part of the economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that some lenders will consider a disability pension to be a valid form of income, and will review home loan applications on a case-by-case basis. Brokers may be of assistance in identifying suitable lenders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 enclosing Petition EN1829 concerning the extension of the 'first entry date' of Prospective Marriage (subclass 300) visa holders who have been unable to enter Australia due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions. The Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, has asked that I respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 19, March 2020, the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, announced a travel ban on all foreign nationals entering Australia, effective 9pm 20 March 2020. Prospective Marriage (subclass 300) visa holders are not exempt from the Australian Government's current travel ban because they are not permanent residents and have not yet been assessed as immediate family members of Australian citizens or permanent residents. The Government is aware that a number of Prospective Marriage visa holders have been unable to enter Australia due to the travel restrictions, and that their visas have ceased or will cease as a result.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 October 2020 as part of the Federal Budget for 2020-21, the Government announced it will be offering refunds or waivers of visa application charges (VAC) for some temporary visa holders affected by COVID-19-related travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">VAC refunds will be available for Prospective Marriage visa holders who have been unable to enter Australia before their visa expired due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Refunds will ensure that visa holders are able to apply for another visa to travel to Australia as appropriate. For those visas that have already expired, any new application will be prioritised. Visa extensions will also be available for Prospective Marriage visa holders in certain circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information about the VAC refund for Prospective Marriage visa holders is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/refunds-and-waivers-visa-application-charges.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your emails of 30 November 2020 regarding the Petitions EN2023 and EN2025, which request that the House of Representatives impose sanctions on members of the Nigerian government and police force involved in any human rights abuses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the 20 October shooting of protestors in Lagos during the Nigerian #EndSARS protests, the Australian Government, on 22 October, expressed its alarm and called on Nigerian authorities to de-escalate the situation and to protect demonstrators exercising their right to protest peacefully.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that in his 23 October address to the Nigerian people, President Buhari committed to abolish the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The Nigerian Vice-President has also announced that the 36 Nigerian State Governors and the Federal Capital Territory Minister had established judicial panels of inquiry to investigate cases of police brutality, due to report before mid-2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to sanctions targeting human rights abuses, in December 2019 I asked the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to inquire into the use of targeted sanctions to address human rights abuses. The Committee received more than 160 public submissions, and heard from a number of witnesses in public hearings. As a longstanding supporter of protections for individual human rights and freedoms, I was pleased by the strong interest in the Committee's inquiry.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee tabled its report in Parliament on 7 December 2020, and the Government is carefully considering the recommendations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021, concerning petition EN2060 - Child Support Adjusted Taxable Income Rules Disadvantage Low Income Earners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners expresses concern about the differences in the way that fringe benefits are assessed for the purposes of child support and family assistance. I would like to assure the petitioners that the Australian Government intends for the child support scheme to be fair for both parents, so they can manage their financial responsibilities towards their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Child support assessments are generally based on a parent's adjusted taxable income, which comprises their taxable income and other supplementary amounts including, among other things, any reportable fringe benefits a parent may be receiving. The inclusion of supplementary amounts ensures child support liabilities are calculated according to a parent's capacity to provide support for their child, regardless of how their income is structured.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Adjusted taxable income, rather than net or gross income, is used in the child support formula because it better reflects parents' true capacity to support their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reportable fringe benefits have been included in adjusted taxable income for child support purposes since 1998, following a recommendation from the 1994 report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, <span style="font-style:italic;">Child support scheme: an examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In most circumstances, fringe benefits are a way of legitimately reducing a person's taxable income by allowing for the receipt of an additional benefit most salary and wage earners would need to meet from their post-tax income. While these arrangements are legitimate for taxation purposes, they should not diminish a parent's fundamental responsibility to support their child in line with their financial capacity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Fringe benefits also form part of an individual's adjusted taxable income for family assistance purposes. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Budget Savings (Omnibus) Act 2016</span> broadly aligned the way that fringe benefits are assessed for family assistance purposes with the way that they are assessed for child support purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petitioners note, fringe benefits received by employees who work for employers that are identified under section 57A of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986</span> were exempt from this change. These employers include registered public benevolent institutions, registered health promotion charities, some hospitals and public ambulance services. Employees of these employers continue to be assessed on the 'adjusted net value' of their fringe benefits for family assistance purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These differences arise primarily because the family assistance and child support schemes are administered under different legislation for different purposes. Eligibility for family assistance is based on the principle of need, and family assistance payments assist most families with some of the costs of raising children in recognition of this socially valuable role. In contrast, the child support scheme is designed to ensure that separated parents take primary responsibility for the financial care of their children and that the children share in the financial circumstances of their parents as they would have if their parents had not separated. These differences are not inconsistencies, but reflect the different nature and intent of the schemes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Separated parents who feel they do not receive any direct advantage from their fringe benefits may apply to Services Australia to have their circumstances considered through the child support change of assessment process. This process allows Services Australia to examine the broader financial circumstances of both parents to determine an appropriate amount of child support payable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to helping families manage their responsibilities for their children following separation and will continue to monitor the effect of child support legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me. </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 15 February 2021 referring to Petition No EN2116, which calls on the House to "support legislation to ensure a minimum budgetary increase for all government accountability agencies each fiscal year, and that the House also supports legislation that ensures that these agencies are free from interference of the Government they are charged with observing and investigating".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does in fact provide a minimum increase in funding for all agencies, via annual funding indexation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It also appropriately applies an efficiency dividend, reflecting the fact that technology and new ways of working continue to provide the opportunity for productivity gains over time. The efficiency dividend has applied to the ANAO since it was introduced by the Hawke Labor Government in 1987-88 and it has operated on a bipartisan basis for over three decades, to ensure that Australian taxpayers share in productivity gains through a reinvestment of these gains in other priorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition refers to an online opinion piece written by two Grattan Institute staff. That short statement only considers five public accountability agencies. Some key public accountability agencies that have received material funding increases in recent Budgets have been overlooked, such as the Courts and Australian Federal Police.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The opinion piece mainly focusses on the Australian National Audit Office, commencing with a claims that the agency Budget has reduced. Although this claim has currency among some commentators, it is incorrect. The claim is based on misunderstanding about the reduction in ANAO reserves due to a one-off property fitout.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Agency reserves can build up in some years and be drawn down at different speeds in various other years (for instance to fund irregular capital commitments). As Deputy Auditor-General Rona Mellow explained in Budget Estimates:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                <span style="font-style:italic;">"Between 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, we've consumed [some of] those prior year appropriations in a number of ways. We needed to move buildings, which meant we needed to fit out accommodation for our staff</span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">.</span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;"> We also chose to invest in IT data storage and some new t</span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">ools for forensic audit analysis</span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">. Those spends we see as one-off investments."</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly accumulated reserves began at a lower total after a year of heavy draw­downs. That merely reflects the sporadic nature of capital investments, not a downward trend in recurrent funding. During the most recent Budget Estimates the Auditor-General was asked whether his annual funding had been cut and said that:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                <span style="font-style:italic;">"There was no change in our budget and forward estimates in the budget process</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to this month's Budget ANAO funding was going up every year of the forward estimates. In the Budget the Government provided the ANAO an additional $61.5 million over four years to address rising costs due to more complex financial data and records management arrangements, new audit controls relating to COVID-19 measures and the need to enhance IT cyber security. This amounts to the largest increase to ordinary operational funding for the ANAO in recent decades.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representation of 15 February 2021 concerning petition number EN2118. The petition asks that the House request His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Ret'd) to terminate the appointment of Mr Kerry Stokes AC to the Council of the Australian War Memorial under subsection 14(1) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian War Memorial Act 1980</span> (the Act).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Council of the Australian War Memorial (the Council) is responsible for the conduct and control of the affairs of the Australian War Memorial (the Memorial). The Council also determines the policy of the Memorial with respect to any matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Members are appointed by the Governor-General having regard to their knowledge and experience with respect to matters relevant to the functions of the Memorial. By convention, members for appointment to the Council are recommended to the Governor-General by the Minister that holds portfolio responsibility for the Memorial. Appointed members hold office part-time for a term not exceeding three years, as is fixed by the Governor-General in the instrument of his or her appointment.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is not my intention to seek the removal of Mr Kerry Stokes AC from his statutory role. I have full confidence in Mr Stokes and continue to stand by his appointment to the Council. This is reflected in his reappointment on 1 August 2020 for a further 12 months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have previously recognised Mr Stokes' extraordinary contribution to the respectful commemoration of the service and sacrifices of Australian Defence Force personnel and their families. I have noted this is a testament to his passion for veterans and their wellbeing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Stokes' offer to fund the legal defence of any of the Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers implicated by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force Afghanistan Inquiry Report should be understood in the context of his long history of supporting veterans' causes and the SAS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As I have stated publically, if Mr Stokes wants to support someone in defending their legal rights, I do not think that is an issue for myself or the government. I do not consider that Mr Stokes' potential funding of legal defence for any of the SAS soldiers could constitute grounds for termination under section 14(1) of the Act as it does not constitute misbehaviour nor evidence of physical or mental incapacity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I note that at the 27 November 2020 meeting, the Council of the Australian War Memorial recorded its unanimous support for Mr Stokes in his role of Chair and also noted his longstanding support of the veteran community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 February 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, regarding a petition to propose a Ministry for Men (EN2133). The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Advancing gender equality involves both men and women, and the Australian Government is committed to improving the lives of all Australians by supporting individuals, families and communities to thrive. At this time, the Prime Minister is satisfied with the composition of the current Ministry and has no plans to include a new ministry for men.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The important issues the petition raises about men's health are currently being addressed by a number of Australian Government policies and programs, noting that both physical and mental health are key priorities for the Government in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Men's Health Strategy 2020-2023 is a gender-focused health framework which aims to drive continuing improvement in the health and wellbeing of all men and boys in Australia, and to reduce inequities in health outcomes between men and women.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, the Government has provided record investment in mental health services and suicide prevention, totalling $5.9 billion in 2020-21 in the health portfolio alone. On 18 December 2020, the Prime Minister announced the Hon David Coleman MP would be taking on the role of Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, again highlighting the Government's attention on this issue. In addition, a commitment of $1.6 billion in 2020-21 for homelessness through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement is in place with state and territory governments.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the international community and respective health systems and economies. The key principles guiding Australian Government decisions on visas while responding to COVID-19 are that our visa system must support public health measures, and settings should not displace job opportunities for Australians .</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the impact that COVID-19 has had on many temporary visa holders. While the Government is not considering a general extension at this time, the Government will continue to explore options for temporary visa holders impacted by COVID-19. When considering potential changes to visa policy settings, immigration risks, labour market impacts and protections for vulnerable workers are primary considerations .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions on reopening the border to international travel will be based on expert health advice. Travel restrictions are reviewed regularly and the latest information is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and appreciates the concerns raised in Petition EN2296. The circumstances of the pandemic remain fluid and the Government will make decisions to address circumstances as they arise.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 March 2021 enclosing Petition EN2321 concerning the processing timeframes experienced by Skilled Regional (subclass 887) visa applicants, and requests the House to request the Department of Home Affairs to allocate more resources to processing these visa applications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Global visa processing timeframes for a Skilled Regional visa is 14 months for 75 per cent of applications and 19 months for 90 per cent of applications. Global visa processing timeframes can be found on the Department's website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-processing-times/global-visa-processing-times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Circumstances that affect processing timeframes include application completeness, applicant responses to requests for additional information, and the length of time required to perform necessary checks on supporting information. Other circumstances, such as how long it takes to receive information from external agencies (for example, relating to health, character and national security requirements) are outside of the Department's control.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, due to COVID-19, some visa processing timeframes have also been affected and applications may take longer to finalise. In part, this is due to the need to prioritise applications for immediate family members of Australian citizens and permanent residents with an urgent need to travel and applicants providing critical or specialist skills in support of the Australian Government's response to COVID-19 and economic recovery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department endeavours to finalise Skilled Regional visa applications within reasonable timeframes, subject to the Government's priorities. As the Skilled Regional is a demand driven visa, finalisations are dependent on the number of applications on-hand and resources available. A concerted effort was made in the first half of 2020-21 to process applications for this subclass. More Skilled Regional visa applications have been finalised in the current program year up until 31 January 2021 than were granted in all of 2019-20.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2321 to my attention .</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">National Broadband Network</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 18 March 2021 concerning petition EN2325, which raises concerns with the Telstra Velocity broadband network that services the Austin Lakes estate in Western Australia and requests that NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) be allowed to roll out in the estate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the concerns the petitioners have raised about the broadband services on the Telstra Velocity fibre network in Austin Lakes. Access to quality, high-speed broadband is of fundamental importance to Australian households, particularly when families may need to work and study from home. The Government expects carriers such as Telstra to provide high quality services that meet the needs of Australians living in areas where they operate networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Telecommunications in New Developments (TIND) policy, which took effect in September 2020, allows NBN Co to overbuild alternative networks where it is commercial for it to do so. The previous version of the policy, which came into effect in 2015, also allowed NBN Co to overbuild alternative networks where it was commercial for it to do so, but did require NBN Co to seek Shareholder Ministers' approval before overbuilding. This requirement has now been removed. NBN Co may therefore overbuild another network, however, this is a commercial matter for the company. The residents of the Austin Lakes estate may wish to again ask NBN Co to consider a deployment in the estate, noting that whether or not it elects to do so, and any charges to recover the costs involved, are commercial matters for it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given the significant investments competing private sector carriers such as Telstra have made in servicing new developments, the Government's preference is to ensure they operate at a standard that meets community expectations. If the networks servicing estates operate appropriately, overbuilding by NBN Co should not be necessary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 December 2020, I made a legislative instrument to designate 127 Telstra Velocity network areas as statutory infrastructure provider (SIP) areas, including the Austin Lakes estate. Telstra is the SIP for those estates pending the completion of the sale of the networks to Uniti, and must meet connection and wholesale supply obligations. The Government has also consulted on proposed standards, rules and benchmarks, with which SIPs must comply. The proposed standards included timeframes for rectifying faults and other measures. The Government anticipates finalising this matter in the coming months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concerning the network outage in the Austin Lakes estate, Telstra advises that there was an outage from 24 December 2020 to 7 January 2021. The outage was caused by a fan failure in the exchange that triggered a critical temperature alarm shutdown. Telstra needed to order components to restore services, which took longer due to the holiday period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra also advises that a number of customers received compensation payments under the Customer Service Guarantee (CSG), noting the network provides voice as well as broadband services. The CSG is a consumer safeguard related to the supply of standard telephone services that requires telephone service providers to meet certain connection, repair and appointment-keeping timeframes or be subject to financial penalties.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra advises that its retail broadband prices in the Austin Lakes estate are the same as its retail prices on the National Broadband Network.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that Uniti has announced that a number of retail service providers, including Telstra, will be able to sell services on the Velocity estates network once the transition to Uniti is complete. Uniti has also announced that it intends to conduct a network 'refresh' to increase maximum broadband speeds within the Velocity networks as it takes ownership of the networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns of the residents of the Austin Lakes estate to my attention. I hope the information in this letter is of some help.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence, originally directed to the Treasurer, regarding petition number EN2332 that contained four signatures. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the time you take to ensure that superannuation matters important to the public are brought to the Government's attention. However, the Government has no intention to direct superannuation fund trustees to invest in particular assets as this could limit the capacity of trustees to pursue investment opportunities that maximise returns to members and, as a result, could reduce the retirement incomes of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Superannuation trustees have a fiduciary duty to make investments in the best interests of their members. These investment decisions do not always match individual member preferences about specific investments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Several superannuation funds already offer members the ability to direct how they want their individual contributions invested among a range of companies and investment products. Such a fund would allow members to ensure that their money is being invested in line with their preferences. If their current superannuation fund does not offer this option, they may wish to consider whether switching to a different fund is in their best interest. Alternatively, they could establish a self-managed superannuation fund that would allow them total control over where their money is invested.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If they are interested in either of these options, I would encourage them to seek professional financial advice to ensure that any arrangements meet their personal needs and objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the petition, I note the Government is considering the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in relation to litigation funding and the regulation of the class action industry. In particular, the report recommends the Government consult on a statutory minimum return to class members of gross class action proceeds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also taken action on other elements of the class action framework, including third party funding. As the Australian Law Reform Commission identified in its <span style="font-style:italic;">Integrity, Fairness and Efficiency-An Inquiry into Class Action Proceedings and Third-Party Litigation Funders Final Report</span>, third party litigation funding is an entrenched element of federal class action proceedings. From 2017 to 2018, 77 per cent of finalised class action proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia received third party funding. The Commission also found the median return to members in third party funded matters was 51 per cent of the settlement, compared to 85 per cent in unfunded proceedings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's changes removed exemptions which applied to litigation funding schemes used in class actions, and brought such schemes within the managed investment scheme regime of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001</span>. This ensures litigation funders are subject to the same regulatory scrutiny and accountability as other financial services and products under the Act.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning petition EN2408 calling on the Australian Government to handle all quarantine at a federal facility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Health Security Agreement establishes a framework for clear, quick and informed decision making to support a coordinated national response to public health emergencies. As set out in the National Health Security Agreement, state and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their respective jurisdictions. This ensures state and territory governments have an appropriate response adapted to each jurisdiction's local epidemiological and public health situation. Public health measures including quarantine requirements are enacted through each jurisdictions' respective public health and emergency legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">National quarantine requirements are informed by the expert medical advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). On 24 December 2020, the AHPPC published National Principles for Hotel Quarantine. This provides nationally agreed guiding principles to set benchmarks for managed quarantine programs across Australia. This way, Australia's efforts will be consistent nationally, while remaining flexible for jurisdictions to achieve a robust hotel quarantine program tailored to their local requirements. Per public health best practice, all states and territories receive and consider the advice of the AHPPC and its expert sub-committees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 14 April 2021, AHPPC published a statement on continuous learning in managed quarantine for international arrivals. The Continuous Improvement Framework considers the findings of previous reviews, including the National Review of Hotel Quarantine published on 23 October 2020. The Continuous Improvement Framework acknowledges there are always opportunities to improve current arrangements, and sets out a framework to ensure the findings of reviews, evaluations and audits are considered in national guidance. To date, there have been a small number of instances of COVID-19 linked to hotel quarantine in Australia. Recent positive cases of quarantine workers in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria have to date not seen seeding events into the local community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is supporting states and territories to provide safe and effective quarantine. As a result of the National Review of Hotel Quarantine, the Centre of National Resilience at Howard Springs was established and will continue to operate as an emergency national facility for quarantine. The Government and the Northern Territory agreed to work together on options to increase quarantine capacity at Howard Springs to 2000 places by the end of May. In addition, the Government acknowledges the large and vital contribution from the Australian Defence Force during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personnel have been deployed to assist with a wide variety of response functions, including quarantine control monitoring and assisting with testing and logistics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While it is not possible for the Federal Minister for Health to be responsible for state and territory response activities, I wish to assure you that the Australian, state and territory governments are committed to continuous quality improvement and work together to coordinate an evidence-based response to COVID-19, based on the latest medical advice. Together, these actions have placed us in a good position globally.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Minimum wages are set by the Fair Work Commission, which is an independent body. In setting minimum wages, the Commission is required to consider a range of economic and social factors, including the performance and competitiveness of the national economy and the needs of the low paid. The current national minimum wage for adult workers effective 1 July 2020 is $19.84 per hour. It is important to recognise that the latest available data shows that Australia has the highest minimum wage in the Organisation for Cooperation and Development (OECD).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2020 Annual Wage Review decision, the Commission increased the national minimum wage by 1.75 per cent, raising it by $0.35 from $19.49 per hour to $19.84 per hour.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2021 Annual Wage Review is currently underway.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2428 - request for a further extension to the JobKeeper Payment for the English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) sector. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was always intended to be a temporary program designed to support confidence and get businesses back up and running as soon as possible. It was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale and it has achieved its objective of keeping businesses in business and Australians in jobs. JobKeeper has supported nearly half of Australian businesses and one-third of all workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It was appropriate for the JobKeeper program to end as other support measures take effect and the economy strengthens. To do otherwise would have been counterproductive for the economy, as the continued operation of the program would have hampered labour mobility and people moving to more productive roles in the labour market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As we move to the next stage of the Australian Government's Economic Recovery Plan, private sector activity will continue to be boosted through a number of measures including tax cuts, business investment incentives, more skills and training places, new infrastructure projects and targeted support like the $1.2 billion aviation and tourism package.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that the international education sector is an important part of the Australian economy - it supports many jobs and we want to see international students return to Australia. However, this can only proceed when it is safe to do so, and without impacting Australians trying to return home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is continuing to monitor the situation in different sectors, to ensure that policy responses are timely, appropriate and proportionate to address the challenges posed by the pandemic. However, we remain confident that there will continue to be a broad-based economic recovery over 2021, given recent strong employment growth and the decreasing reliance on JobKeeper over recent months.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition Number EN2451 calling on the House to support the formation of an international tribunal to investigate crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DRC has been a State Party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) since 2002 and therefore the ICC's jurisdiction applies in the DRC. In 2004, the ICC opened an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the DRC from 1 July 2002 onwards. The ICC has since found several Congolese defendants guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Cases related to the DRC remain before the ICC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a longstanding supporter of the ICC and provides consistent financial support to the Court. Australia also provides voluntary funding to key initiatives, including the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, which implements reparation awards and reconciliation activities in the DRC. Accordingly, Australia supports the ICC's existing investigation and prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the DRC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

With respect to Nagorno-Karabakh, Australia continues to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group to negotiate a permanent settlement of the conflict.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to recent correspondence regarding Petition Number PN0505. The petition draws to the attention of the House allegations of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China, including reports of state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China. The petition requests the House take action in response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to promoting and protecting human rights, including freedom of religion and freedom of belief for all people. We remain concerned that religious groups in China, including Falun Gong practitioners, and prisoners of conscience, continue to be targeted on the basis of their beliefs. We have regularly raised our concerns about this issue with China, including at ministerial level, both directly and in international forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is carefully monitoring reports of illegal organ harvesting in China, and regularly reviews available evidence as new reports are published. We are aware organs have been harvested from executed prisoners in China for use in medical transplants, at least prior to 2015. In May 2020, officials from the Australian High Commission in London met with the Chair of the China Tribunal, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, to further discuss the findings of the Tribunal's full report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to preventing organ trafficking. Since 2004, the Government has had a comprehensive strategy to combat such crimes and is committed to ensuring Australia's response to organ trafficking and transplant tourism remains as effective as possible. Australia's states and territories have robust frameworks in place to regulate lawful donation and transplants of human organs and tissue for therapeutic purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We will continue to closely monitor reports of mistreatment and restrictions against religious groups in China and seek opportunities to respond strongly to identified abuses.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning petition EN2458 requesting a Royal Commission on the Australian Pesticides Regulation System.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safe use of agricultural and veterinary (agvet) chemicals is vital for farm productivity, protecting crops and livestock from a broad range of weeds, insects and disease. Farm productivity, in turn, provides food and fibre to all Australians and supports our vibrant regional communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the concerns raised in the petition regarding the regulation of pesticides in Australia and recognise the potential risks posed by the improper use of agvet chemicals. That is why the Australian Government's priority with respect to agvet chemical use is protecting people, animals and the environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, agvet chemicals are regulated under the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. Before agvet chemical products can be supplied or used in Australia they must be evaluated and registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APVMA employs a robust, risk-based approach to regulate agvet chemicals, rather than a hazard-based approach. A hazard assessment considers only the potential for harm due to the intrinsic properties of a chemical. A risk assessment combines hazard assessment with exposure assessment in real-world situations, including in urban areas, to calculate the likelihood of an adverse outcome. The APVMA's assessment also considers the risk of pesticide spray drift: the unintended movement of pesticides from the application site to nearby areas, such as between neighbouring farms. It is a legislative requirement that the APVMA only register agvet chemical products where it is satisfied that the risks of use can be mitigated through specific dosage, application and safety instructions on the product label.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments are then responsible for regulating and enforcing the safe use of agvet chemicals after they are sold.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure the continued safety, quality and effectiveness of agvet chemicals supplied within Australia, manufacturers and users are required to provide information on adverse experiences to the APVMA. In response to an adverse experience report, the APVMA may request changes to how the product is manufactured, packaged or used. The APVMA can cancel the registration of a product and remove it from the market where there are unmitigated risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government does not consider that there has been a failure in the regulation of pesticides that would warrant the level of enquiry, investigative powers and cost of a Royal Commission. Isolated instances of concern and differences in international regulatory practice are not signs of a systematic or systemic issue. The Australian system remains strong overall, with opportunities for targeted and ongoing improvement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government continues to look at opportunities to improve the regulatory system. You may be aware that an independent panel of experts recently completed a comprehensive review on the regulatory framework. The review examined the agvet chemicals regulatory framework's aims, structure, and operation, and made recommendations to ensure it is contemporary and fit for purpose. I am currently considering the final report of the review and working with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment to develop timelines for a government response. The review report will be published in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning Petition EN2486 - work with APRA and impose restrictions on lenders to only allow a sole borrower on all loans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not prescribe the conditions under which housing loans are provided but does set regulatory standards through its prudential regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prudential regulation is concerned with maintaining the safety and soundness of financial institutions, so that the community can have confidence that they will meet their financial commitments under all reasonable circumstances. In recent years, APRA intensified its prudential supervision to ensure the stability of the banking sector, including targeting sound lending standards, the share of interest-only loans in all new residential mortgage lending, and growth in investor housing loans. These measures reflected concerns about elevated risks in home loan lending, in an environment of historically low interest rates, high and rising household debt, intensified competition pressure and subdued income growth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">APRA's lending benchmarks on investor and interest-only lending were always intended to be temporary. Both had served their purpose of moderating higher risk lending and supporting a gradual strengthening of lending standards across the industry over a number of years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">APRA is closely monitoring current developments in the housing market and has a range of macroprudential tools that could be used should risks to financial stability emerge.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle behind the No Domestic COVID Vaccine Passports Bill 2021 is quite simple: COVID vaccines in this country should be freely available to all, with informed consent of course, but they should be mandatory to nobody. Already, there are 16 US states that have introduced similar legislation to that which I am introducing today. This bill has been modelled on Florida's bill, introduced by Governor DeSantis, which has been widely accepted by the Florida electorate. I hope that this parliament will move forward and bring this bill on for debate and a vote as soon as possible. This bill is simply about the type of country that we want. Do we want a country where government officials and petty bureaucrats demand that you show your medical papers? That is not the country that I want. Your medical records should be something between you and your doctor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The entire concept of a vaccine passport is itself inherently misleading. There is little evidence to show that these novel experimental COVID genetic vaccines actually prevent someone from contracting COVID or prevent someone from spreading COVID or prevent someone from being hospitalised with COVID. For the education of the member at the desk, I have the latest data from the US on what they call 'vaccine breakthrough cases'. These are cases where someone has been injected twice and, after a period of 14 days, still contracts COVID. The number is so many that they no longer count them, but they do count the number of hospitalisations. As at 14 June, the number of so-called breakthrough cases—that is, people who have been vaccinated twice and have ended up in hospital with COVID—stands at 2,622, and the number of deaths of people who have been vaccinated twice in the US and have passed away from COVID stands at 549. However, these numbers, the CDC says, are 'likely a substantial undercount' of all SARS infections among so-called fully vaccinated persons, and this surveillance relies upon 'passive and voluntary reporting'. So we don't actually know what the true number of breakthrough cases are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also growing concern over vaccine safety. The highly respected and highly credentialed Dr Tess Lawrie recently stated in submission she made that, 'There is more than enough evidence to declare that the COVID vaccines are unsafe for use in humans.' This is also a great concern, as we also have data from VAERS in the USA that shows that, as at 4 June, there have been 5,888 deaths that have occurred in people after the vaccine. Now it is true that this VAERS data is questionable. Dr Peter McCullough suggested that the number is more like 50,000 rather than 5,888. But the fact is that we just do not know. Again, this VAERS data is based on voluntary reporting. So we simply have no idea about what the true rate of deaths are after COVID injections and we have no idea whether they were related to them or just a mere coincidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd say that's the entire problem, because we have to admit that this is still one giant medical experiment. I'd liked to quote Dr Damian Wojcik of New Zealand. Talking about having his patients injected, he said: 'Not on my watch. Not with my patients. My patients are living persons with names and families, not laboratory rats to be sacrificed in a global experiment.' Dr Roger Hodkinson—a doctor from Canada—said recently: 'This experimental vaccine should never have been released. Mass vaccination is so transparently stupid; medical idiocy of a grotesque degree. The bottom line is that mass vaccination of everybody should stop immediately. And when it comes to injecting this stuff into the arms of children, I call this "state sanctioned child abuse".' Dr Peter McCullough has recently stated, 'I can no longer recommend the vaccines'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, as this is a medical experiment, the idea of having a vaccine passport is coercive. It is to coerce people into participating in a medical experiment, of which we simply do not know what the end result will be. We've even seen here in Australia how our medical bureaucrats have got it wrong time and time again. Firstly, when it came to the AstraZeneca vaccine, they said that there was no evidence of a relationship with blood clots. They were dangerously wrong. Then it was clear from the data out of Europe, from the European Medicines Agency, that the AstraZeneca should be suspended and most European countries elected for a cut-off date of 60 years of age. So, if you were under 60, in most European countries they did not give you the AstraZeneca vaccine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But our medical bureaucrats decided that the Europeans didn't know what they were doing and that we would have the cut-off at 50. Only last week they admitted that they were wrong again, and the result of their error has been that 800,000 Australians have been injected with a substance which our Chief Medical Officer now says has a greater risk than any benefit. This was 800,000 Australians injected, where the risk was greater to them than any benefit because of a mistake by our medical bureaucrats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing is that we should look at that risk-benefit analysis. But we've seen that the short-term risks have been grossly underestimated by health officials around the world. That's why there have been suspensions and recalls. But we have no idea of the medium-term risks, we have no idea of the long-term risks and we have no idea of the intergenerational risks. Therefore, for anyone to stand up and say that they know that the benefits outweigh the risks, well, they simply cannot say that. If you cannot quantify medium-, long-term and intergenerational risks then you simply cannot make that assessment—the data is not there. We're flying blind into this experiment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's also why we do not need a domestic vaccine passport in this country. It would also be a complete violation of human rights. The UN Economic and Social Council has said, 'The right to health contains freedoms such as "the right to control one's health and body, including sexual and reproductive freedom, and the right to be free from interference, such as the right to be free from torture, non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make special mention of our Paralympic squad. We have bureaucrats there running that Paralympic squad that have decided to discriminate against Paralympians. So we have a situation where athletes are playing the same sport, going to the same country, going to the same city, going to the same Olympic facilities and playing at the same stadiums. If they are a Paralympian they are forced into this experiment—otherwise they are not picked. If they are in the normal Olympics, that does not apply. That is discrimination. That is contrary to the principles of this bill. I would call on Paralympic Australia to end their discrimination against athletes going to the Paralympics. With that, I commend this bill to the House, and I also congratulate my good friend the member for Dawson on being the seconder for this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paying a ransom does not guarantee you'll be able to quickly bring your systems back online or prevent further disruption—in fact, quite the contrary—and it does not guarantee your data won't be leaked.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it does do is provide further resources to the criminal organisations mounting these attacks and create an incentive for them to carry out more attacks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But where organisations feel compelled to make these payments, government should be involved. When arguing that mandatory notification of ransomware payments is the minimum the government should be doing in this space, the former head of MI6 Alex Younger said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If one accepts that this is a national security problem, then it becomes hard to defend the suggestion that governments should simply leave these decisions to private citizens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandating reporting of ransomware payments is far from a silver bullet for this national security problem, but it is a crucial first step.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For two years, cybersecurity languished at the bottom of the former home affairs minister's to-do list. He never even said there word 'ransomware' in this chamber, as the threat grew by 200 per cent. So I welcomed the decision to give the new Assistant Minister for Defence responsibility for the ACSC when he was appointed towards the end of 2020. Similarly, I have welcomed the fact that Minister for Home Affairs has said that cybersecurity would be a priority for her when she assumed the portfolio in March. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While ransomware grew dramatically as a threat to Australian organisations over the past two years, cybersecurity policy was politically leaderless under the Morrison government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we see attacks on one of our biggest meat producers, it is a crisis. When we see attacks on one of our biggest media organisations, it is a crisis. When we see attacks on multiple health and hospital networks, it's a crisis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you allow access, even though it is very limited access, to your defence data, your firewalls are always undermined, particularly since it was the Chinese that put the firewalls there in the first place. In other words, they have access to all information. They know the exact number, if not the location, of our artillery, our ammunition dumps, our tanks, our naval harbour bases and the position of every warplane hangar. I use the example of Townsville. There's been a magnificent building of concrete and metal that enables those planes to survive even if they get a direct hit. To rebuild all of that in Townsville it may take $20 million or $30 million, and you can multiply that a thousand times for all over Australia, so we can't rebuild everything. In the meantime, they know where every single warplane can be parked in Australia. There might be 400 or 500 parking bays in Australia, but they know where they are, and you gave all of this to them, yet you still refuse to take China and foreign powers out of the system. What is wrong with you! Even when all of this is disclosed you still refuse to act. You say: 'Oh, yes, we've removed sensitive data. Oh, yes, we've repositioned a lot of that data. Oh, we've done this and we've done that.' But you, the bureaucracy that runs this country, will never admit that you are wrong. Never!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been a senior minister for almost a decade in the Queensland government, I can tell you that the bureaucracy think that they're right all of the time and that everything they've done is always right because they did it. If you can't stand up and be the bosses of the bureaucracy, then we are not living in a democracy. At the present moment that is the case, because of the weakness of government. We need to stand behind the new Minister for Defence and the Assistant Minister for Defence. They have a record of being very, very strong in these areas, but they will not find it easy, and we must put pressure on the system continuously to enable them to do their job. If, by chance, they change their mind and decide not to do the job, then the pressure, naturally, would go upon them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an entrenched bureaucracy that, like a cancer, must be completely cut out. That cancer is global switch, but that cancer also is the bureaucracy of the armed forces, a bureaucracy that seems to be more preoccupied with political correctness on issues such as whether we use the word 'kill' or if we have 50 per cent women on the front line or even whether a tweet on the internet or a criticism in the media calls for the punishment of our own Australian armed forces personnel. It seems that they remain guilty until they can prove themselves innocent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is that the way to run the armed forces of Australia? Why? Because people are wanting to ingratiate themselves to the proponents of the conventional wisdom of the day. They think that that is infinitely more important than defending their country. Well, in a time of war I know what would happen to people like this, and, believe me, this happens. For almost three years in World War II, certainly over 2½ years, the Army refused to have a submachine gun. One in three weapons held by the Germans and by the Russians, the major combatants in the Second World War, was a submachine gun, but here was the Australian bureaucracy—the colonel blimps on top of the bureaucracy—saying, 'We don't use submachine guns in the Australian Army.' The politicians then had the guts to stand up to them, although it took them two years to get the courage to do it, and overrule them and give our Australian troops fighting in New Guinea the most necessary weapon that they needed: the submachine gun. Even then, they bought sten guns that didn't work in the jungle. Thank the good Lord the government once again forced them to introduce another gun, the Owen gun.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All aspects of the protection of this country should be a hundred per cent under the ownership of Australians, not corporations where we don't know the ownership of the corporations—they might be registered in Australia, but we don't know who owns them—and never ever a foreign corporation itself. There has been focus upon China, but it should be upon, as my learned colleague who is seconding this motion will put very strongly, any foreign corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infinitely more important than fixing this problem—a classic case of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted—overwhelmingly more important, is the cancer of free-market policies and the most irresponsible attitude that enables anyone to get the contracts for our soldiers' combat boots, our information storage and retrieval systems, and heaven only knows what else! The honourable member for Herbert, who represents Townsville, is in the House. It bears mentioning that in the Anzac Day march some three years ago, or whenever, reportedly over 1,000 soles of the combat boots worn by the soldiers marching on Anzac Day were left in the streets of Townsville. Where did the combat boots come from? They came from China. What sort of a country has its combat boots—well, I wear Blue Steel, and if there is a better boot made in Australia than Blue Steel, I'd like to wear it. Tell me about it. Their boots are made in Australia. Why didn't they get the contracts?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I second the motion moved by the member for Kennedy. I agree very strongly with the member for Kennedy that no Australian security data should be in the custody of any foreign owned company. This isn't about any one particular country; this is about all countries other than our own. No defence or other security data should be in their possession. It should be in our possession.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke in some detail about this matter quite recently, and I made a number of points. And, ever so briefly, I will make those points again. For Australian defence data to be in the custody of a foreign owned company is an affront to our national security. It is an affront to our sovereignty. It is an affront to Australian companies and Australian jobs. Now, I do note the Assistant Minister for Defence came into this place recently and defended the government continuing with a foreign owned company keeping our defence data. I have enormous respect for the Assistant Minister for Defence, and I thought he did a pretty good job of defending the government's position. The problem is that what he said is completely and utterly out of step with community expectations. At the end of the day, we are hired to represent the community. We have a three-year contract to represent the community, and it does not represent the community to allow a foreign owned company to have our defence data in their custody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Kennedy and I have often remarked, you can't make this stuff up. It's just an absurdity. You can't make it up that we've got a foreign owned company storing our defence data. It must stop and the member for Kennedy's Repatriation of Defence Data Bill 2021 would ensure that. I call on the government and the opposition to support this bill.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small and medium businesses are the engine room of our economy. That's why the Treasurer's recent budget focuses so heavily on ensuring our small- and medium-business owners get the relief they need to keep our economy moving forward. There are more than 10,600 small and medium businesses in the electorate of Herbert, and that's why I wanted to move this motion this morning—to highlight how this budget will potentially help not only each and every one of them, but others around the country as well. We've made a massive investment in small and medium businesses through a range of tax relief measures, but in particular by extending temporary full expensing—what we used to call the instant asset write off—extending loss carryback measures and establishing a patent box for the biotechnology and medical technology sectors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that these measures work. Since the October 2020 budget, investment in new machinery and equipment has increased at its fastest rate since March 2003, increasing by 8.5 per cent in the December quarter and 10.3 per cent in the March quarter to be 7.2 per cent higher over the year. Extending temporary full expensing and temporary loss carryback for an additional year is estimated to deliver an additional $20.7 billion in tax relief to businesses over the forward estimates period and support an estimated $320 billion worth of investment. Temporary full expensing has been a policy of ours for a number of years that has been really ramped up during the response to COVID-19. It allows businesses to deduct the full cost of equipment in the first year, instead of over a number of years. Come tax time, this results in more of their profits back in their business and more money pumping through our local economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is so important. Just think about the flow-on effect. If a local business in my electorate of Herbert buys a new piece of equipment, its productivity will hopefully increase and it will be able to put on more people and create more jobs for locals in Townsville. But it doesn't stop there. Think about the supply lines, the small business where they purchase the equipment and the sale that that small business may not have otherwise had. It means they can support more jobs and grow and expand themselves. We're already seeing this at work in Townsville. Business confidence is now at its highest level in 14 years with hundreds of jobs vacant. And into the mix come other initiatives like HomeBuilder, where the construction industry is going gangbusters keeping up with building new homes, not to mention the extra places for the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme we announced over the weekend. The loss carryback measures are also a huge win for local businesses. Eligible businesses can carry back losses to earlier years, resulting in a refundable tax offset and potentially more cash in the bank to pump back into their business. So I would encourage all local owners of small and medium businesses to talk to their accountants about how they may be able to make the most of this opportunity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in this time of global pandemic we should be doing everything we can to be supporting and encouraging local medical and biotech businesses to innovate. Through this budget we're doing that by introducing a patent box. The patent box will reduce taxes on income from innovative research to encourage businesses to undertake their research and development in Australia and keep patents here.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  The Labor opposition welcomes any new investment in the biotechnology and medical tech sectors, and in the Hunter we are proudly home to the Hunter Medical Research Institute, which does fantastic work every day. I am pleased to speak on this motion, but it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that this motion acts to distract from the fact that the 2021-22 budget has failed to address critical infrastructure needs in regions like mine. In my electorate of Paterson, we're still waiting on the M1 Pacific Motorway extension to Raymond Terrace. I've been championing the need for this vital piece of infrastructure since I was elected in 2016, and as a resident of the Hunter I'd known about this problem for 10 years prior to that as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk to those opposite. I want to take them through the time line of the Liberal lip-service when it comes to this critical piece of infrastructure. Back in 2015 the New South Wales coalition promised to fund the planning for this project. It was a bloke called Duncan Gay. He was the freight and roads minister for the New South Wales government at the time, and he announced $200 million to complete the planning. Fast forward to 2018, when the federal Liberals promised the project yet again, claiming that this was a critical need for our region and an absolute priority. But did we see any more money for the planning or any actual getting on with the project? No, we did not. Did we see any environmental impact study or expression of interest for tender? Not a single thing. We waited, and the coffers sat empty. In April 2019 Anthony Albanese, then Labor's shadow minister for infrastructure, and I spoke out, and we said how vital this project was again. Albo committed $1.5 billion to get this project going under a Labor government.</span>

                  </a>  Then the shadow minister for infrastructure and roads for Labor said this project needed to happen. This government rushed to re-announce its election commitment again. But would you believe it? There's still no money. The people of the Hunter have seen absolutely no leadership from this government on the M1.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project must be a priority for this government, and it must be an urgent priority for Transport for NSW and the New South Wales government as well. I know from the department that the federal government is where the hold-up is. Those opposite have absolutely no intention of fast tracking this project, and it must be fast tracked. It should have been done 15 years ago. It should be started tomorrow—today in fact! The Hunter is dealing with the fallout from this pandemic. We need jobs and investment now. This piece of infrastructure alone will create jobs. It will create investment and it will create the ability for people to move through the region and to get to their small businesses—to get to their jobs and to get the big freight moving across our country. How can the government pat itself on the back when vital infrastructure like this, that has been promised for over 15 years, has not been followed up and built? They talk a lot about jobs and delivery, but we've not seen a jot from them about the M1. The federal government's own department of infrastructure website is now predicting that the expected start of this project will be mid-2023, with completion blown out to 2029. This is totally unacceptable. They need to get on and fast track this project, right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mind-blowing incompetence is just incredible. Those opposite will blame the bureaucracy and they will blame each other, between states and the federal government. But, at the end of the day, the buck stops with this federal government. And when you compare it to Labor, who got on and delivered things like the Hunter Expressway, that is carrying traffic right now, today, it took a federal Labor government to put funding into that project. It also took a federal Labor government to properly invest in the Pacific Highway. John Howard invested $1.3 billion over 12 years. We invested $7.6 billion in half that time. The people of Paterson and the Hunter know who will fast track this project. The M1 needs to be done. It will be done by a Labor government, unlike this Liberal government ,who make empty promises and don't fund them.</span>

                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise to speak on this motion by the member for Herbert about the range of supports that this government has provided to small and medium business right across my electorate of Forde. This motion, in particular, focuses on the extended temporary expensing measures, the extended loss carry-back measures and, importantly, on establishing a patent box for our biotechnology and medical technology sectors. All of these are predicated on boosting the investment of support for business right across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These incentives are unprecedented in their scale and scope, and are available to over 99 per cent of all businesses, which, together, employ around 11.5 million Australians. Since the budget of October 2020, investments in new machinery and equipment have increased at their fastest rate since March 2003. They increased by 8.5 per cent in the December quarter and 10.3 per cent in the March quarter, to be 7.2 per cent higher over the year. These investments will boost economic activity and employment opportunities both in the short term and the longer term. In the longer term, equally, they will boost the productive manufacturing capacity of the economy of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget will ensure this momentum continues. An estimated $320 billion worth of investment is expected to be supported off the back of these initiatives, combined with an additional $20.7 billion in tax relief to business over the forward estimates. This is investment which goes through the supply chain. We can look at a business like Holmwood Highgate and its success with defence contracts. Over 80 per cent of materials that go into new defence contracts for manufacturing water and fuel tankers is sourced from our local supply chain. It's this government, through its investment in these initiatives but also in its support for business through the R&amp;D tax incentive, that is helping to create the opportunity for businesses to innovate and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that in my electorate of Forde the many small to medium businesses across the electorate that I have met with and talked to recently are very thankful for the JobKeeper program over the past 12 months. It ensured that they were able to keep their doors open and keep people employed. And they appreciate a number of the other grant programs, such as those I've outlined. The Manufacturing Modernisation Fund has helped the business I mentioned earlier, Holmwood Highgate. They've been able to invest, through that, in a state-of-the-art laser cutter for aluminium and steel. The consequence of these investments is that they're growing their workforce, putting on more apprentices. And all of this leads to jobs in our local community. They have even entered into partnerships with our local high schools to bring in school based apprentices and trainees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This creates further opportunities and pathways for our students and helps them to understand that there are myriad job opportunities in the electorate of Forde and right across the country that don't always involve, initially, going to university. This showed in the unemployment numbers that were released last week. The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent, exceeding all expectations. Employment is now 130,000 above its level in March 2020, pre-COVID. The incentives that the government has created are about helping people grow and build their businesses, therefore growing and driving our economy and ensuring job opportunities for Australians. They are helping business, and many of the 17½ thousand businesses across the electorate of Forde have been able to take advantage of these opportunities. I know this is creating economic activity and job opportunities. It is just another example of this government continuing to deliver for Australians, each and every day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  If it really believed in helping small businesses, if it really believed in supporting the business community, this government would be doing two things: it would be fixing national quarantine and it would be fixing the vaccination rollout. These are the things that, more than anything else, businesses in my electorate are raising with me. They do not understand. The leaders of small businesses run logistics operations day in, day out. They watch the absolute incompetence of this vaccination rollout and say: 'This is the one thing you could do to support us. It's the one piece of public health infrastructure that would support our businesses right now.' Instead, in the first half of this year we've had two lockdowns in Western Australia because hotel quarantine is no longer fit for purpose and our community is not vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses say to me time and time again that they want to get quarantine out of my electorate, out of the Perth CBD, because when it leaks it leaks into our most-densely-populated suburbs, and it is those small businesses—the cafes in the city who rely on workers going in and out each day—that pay the price more than anyone else. So the piece of investment that this budget really needed was an investment in a national quarantine solution. We've seen proposals come week after week, including RAAF Base Learmonth and RAAF Base Busselton. The latest proposal is putting something at Perth Airport. Any of these would be a major investment in making sure that our small businesses, our family businesses and our microenterprises can continue to invest with confidence, because they will see the government doing what they should be doing, which is providing the sort of public health infrastructure that gives them the certainty and confidence to invest. It was August last year, almost a year ago, when the World Health Organization was warning about the dangers of hotel quarantine. For every 204 infected travellers in hotel quarantine there is a leak, which is practically one out of every 200. We know that just a few infections can lead to statewide or citywide lockdowns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got business owners who are also bringing really good solutions to these problems. I met with Nigel Oakey, who many would know as the managing director of Dome cafes in Western Australia. If you have an electorate in Western Australia you probably have two or three Dome cafes. They have fabulous food, great coffee and it's a lovely place to meet friends and family or have a work meeting. Nigel has done some fabulous work in terms of looking at the best-practice solutions around the world. How do we make sure that we can prevent any transmission into the community? Because that's clearly what the Australian public expect right now as they are waiting months and months for vaccines—a problem that seems to get more complex, not less, as time rolls on. So I would encourage the Prime Minister and the health minister to reach out to Nigel Oakey and have a chat to him. He has ideas that would not just help Western Australia but help this whole country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget locks in $1 trillion of debt with no plan and no time line to repay it. If a small business walked into a bank and said: 'I would like to take on a few million dollars of debt. I won't tell you when I will repay it. I won't tell you what the plan is. I'm not going to tell you where the revenue will come from. I'm not going to tell you where all that money is going'—given that we have all of these dark pools of funds and the government refuses to tell us what they're going to be invested in, where they're spending that taxpayer money—they would be laughed out of the bank. Indeed, businesses in Western Australia do find this government's financial management approach concerning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the member for Pearce was the Treasurer for Western Australia he locked in spending that resulted in $40 billion of state debt. We're now seeing that same reckless approach amplified on a national scale, locking in huge amounts of debt with no plan to repay it, just some sort of assurance that somehow this government are good financial managers. Well, after eight years there is absolutely no evidence that this government are good financial managers. We know that when they start trying to fix their financial mess they'll start cutting health, they'll start cutting Medicare and now even the New South Wales Liberal Treasurer wants to come after Western Australia's GST. It is not good enough. This government has no plan. It just has terrible ideas like cutting Medicare and stealing WA's GST.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  In looking back over the past 15 months, Australians have weathered a storm on multiple fronts. The first global pandemic in a century plunged our economy into recession, and the outlook was certainly grim. Some of Bennelong's 23,000 businesses even had to shut up shop, and the typical bustle of people came to a halt as we did our best to stop the spread. In looking back now, Australia's recovery has been remarkable, with countries around the world watching in awe as we bounced back from recession and returned, more or less, to normality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was just last week that unemployment had fallen to 5.1 per cent, the same figure as reported in February last year. Economic growth has rebounded, and Australia is the only OECD country to have its GDP higher now than it was before the pandemic. As we bask in this astonishing recovery, it's a good time to reflect on how we got here. The Morrison government has remained committed to securing Australia's economic recovery since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid rollout of economic stimulus packages helped Australian families get by during the trying lockdown periods. Looking to the future, the 2021-22 budget has reinforced the government's sustained commitment to recovery, unveiling several important initiatives designed to foster economic growth and keep unemployment down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a strong and generous budget, which will deliver an enormous amount to the people of Bennelong. One of the most important reforms of this year's budget is the enormous tax relief to be delivered across the board. The focus on supporting further job creation is revealed in the extension of the full temporary expensing and loss carry-back measures. These measures, initially announced in last year's October budget, have been extended for a further 12 months until June 2023. Temporary full expensing allows eligible businesses with an aggregated annual turnover of less than $5 billion to deduct the full cost of eligible depreciable assets. The temporary loss carry-back extension will allow eligible companies to carry back tax losses from the 2022-23 income year to offset previous tax profits as far back as the 2018-19 income year. It sounds dry, but this will be a huge shot in the arm—like the one I got on Friday—for local businesses. The initiatives together are expected to boost GDP by about $18 billion and create around 60,000 jobs by 2023. More than 23,000 businesses in Bennelong will now be able to write off the full value of any eligible assets they purchase. In addition around 9,800 local businesses can use the extended loss carry-back measures to keep their cash flows working smoothly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For small businesses, the past 12 months have been extremely challenging. Our government has consistently recognised the importance of small businesses to the Australian economy. These new measures acknowledge the pressure they have faced and our commitment to ensuring that Australia's small businesses and medium-sized businesses can bounce back and return to strong growth over the next few years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to promoting the bottom line of local businesses, we're also promoting our enterprising inventors and innovators from Macquarie University, Macquarie Park and across the electorate. The patent box policy, which has been successfully introduced in 20 countries worldwide, will see the concessional tax rate for Australian developed and patented medical and biotech innovations effectively halved to 17 per cent. In May I had the pleasure of hosting the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, at Macquarie based Cochlear to showcase the incredible work they have been doing. Cochlear are the world's leaders in the technology and development of medical devices for the hearing impaired. Under the new patent box policy, companies like Cochlear will be encouraged to undertake even more research and development, creating local jobs and helping to secure Australia's economic recovery. Bennelong's Macquarie University is committed to fostering research and development into new and important ideas, processes and products. We hope to see the new policy encouraging local students to develop their medical and biotech innovations and bring them to the market. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said many times that Bennelong is the capital of innovation in Australia. Policies like this patent box will ensure that companies can continue to be at the cutting edge of research and monetise their discoveries. The future is bright for Australian innovators, and I congratulate the government for its work and its support of our local businesses at all levels.</span>

                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  This motion from Mr Thompson seeks to congratulate the government for its performance around business investment levels in Australia. I don't know what planet Mr Thompson and those opposite are living on, but, in case they haven't checked lately with the ABS statistics or indeed the RBA, business investment in Australia has fallen off a cliff since this government got elected. It's quite stark that it actually happened as soon as the Abbott government was elected in 2013. The share of nominal GDP that is taken up by business investment has fallen. The share of nominal GDP taken up by business investment was 18 per cent in 2013. Have a guess what it's fallen to today? Over the course of this government, it has fallen to less than five per cent in Australia. The fall is quite dramatic. It happened as soon as the Abbott government was elected, and there's a reason for that. The reason is that, once the Abbott government were elected, in their first budget they got rid of full expensing of capital equipment and extending those loss carry-back measures. They got rid of these measures that they're actually congratulating themselves on here today. It was only after a couple of years that they worked out, 'That was a bad decision; we're going to put them back in.' They were Labor policies, by the way. They're saying, 'We're going to put them back in, and we'll try and reverse the trend.' And, like a lot of things that this government takes on, it hasn't worked, and business investment has continued to fall in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say that when it comes to economic indicators, business investment isn't the only one. They're not alone on that, because, when it comes to nearly every other key economic indicator, Australia has got worse under this government. We all know that people's incomes aren't increasing. Real wages in Australia are actually falling, and the government admits this in the budget papers that they've just released. Over the course of the forward estimates, Australians are going to go backwards when it comes to their real wages. Labour productivity is the key to economic growth. If we're going to get our economy growing again, the key is to get more labour productivity into our system. Yet what has gone on with labour productivity? For the first time since we've been collecting data about labour productivity growth in Australia, it has actually fallen. So under this government Australia is producing less per employee than it has at any other time since we've been keeping records about labour productivity here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what's gone on with household debt in this country. It has exploded. It's at the highest level it has ever been. We're now third worst in the OECD when it comes to levels of household debt—principally around the issue of ballooning house prices, which are out of control once again. There has been a 20 per cent growth in house prices over the course of the last 12 months under this government. What are they doing to arrest that? What are they doing to make sure that younger Australians can get a leg into the housing market? They're introducing all of these first-home-buyer schemes. It's like pouring fuel on the fire; it's making it worse. Talk to any real estate agent throughout the country, and they'll tell you that whenever these first-home-buyer incentives are brought in you'll see record house price growth for the next 12 months. It's pouring fuel on the fire, and it's making it worse for younger Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wealth inequality is increasing under this government in Australia at the moment. When it comes to social indicators, we're going backwards on those as well. We've all seen what has come out of the aged-care royal commission: vulnerable elderly Australians have been abused, the aged-care waiting list has ballooned and people have died waiting for aged-care packages in this country. When it comes to the NBN, Australia ranks 61st in the world for download speeds. That's something to be proud of, isn't it? We're 61st in the world when it comes to the speed of our internet, and it has fallen year after year after year under this government. In business investment, a key thing is research and development spending. Guess where that has gone under this government? In 2013, it was 2.1 per cent of GDP; it's now 1.79 per cent of GDP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, Australia has gone backwards in every single economic indicator. I don't know what world those opposite are living in. You can't come into this chamber and congratulate yourself for business investment when it has actually fallen under your government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This House has heard before about the plight of the world's Assyrian people—the plight that has had generations of violence, of oppression and, indeed, of attempted genocide. This situation worsened following the fall of Saddam Hussein. I remember celebrating with our local Assyrian people after the fall of Hussein, because it was felt that brighter days might be ahead. But, alas, that was not to be the case. There were, it is estimated, one million Christians in Iraq in the year 2000. There are now 150,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That oppression and violence, which has lasted for generations, continues beyond 2003 to 2010, with the massacre at the Our Lady of Salvation church, which was a terrible, terrible event, and there have been ongoing attempts by the Assyrian diaspora around the world to get attention for the plight of the Assyrian people and to get a homeland for the Assyrian people in Iraq. Again we celebrated in 2016, when the Iraqi government agreed in principle to a homeland for the Assyrian people, but, alas, it has not yet occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to bring the attention of the House in particular to the plight of those Assyrians in north-west Iraq, who have fled ISIS inspired violence in the past and are now being subject to bombings by Turkey in relation to the dispute between Turkey and the PKK. Those Assyrians who live in the Duhok province and in villages like Zakho and Bersivy are people who have been driven out of other towns and cities in Iraq, particularly around 2014 with the rise of ISIS. The Arabic letter 'nun' was put on the doors of the homes of Assyrian people and they were told to convert or face murder, and they had to flee. Accordingly they fled to villages where they are now being bombed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the dispute between Turkey and the PKK, it is not the fault of the Assyrian people. This motion calls on the Turkish government to cease the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, because it is the Assyrian people who are paying the price in that dispute. This motion does call for that to occur, and it is urgent that it does occur. For too long the Assyrian people have been a footnote. They have not been thought of in disputes in the Middle East, whether internal in Iraq or between countries in the Middle East. That must come to an end. The Assyrian people, the Indigenous people of Iraq, the people who have given the world so much, deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the brief time remaining I want to touch on a few other elements. I want to take this opportunity—I think it's appropriate in the House—to pay tribute to the patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Gewargis III. He has been the patriarch since 2015. He is a much-loved figure by Assyrians around the world, including in Australia. I met him on his first visit to Australia as patriarch. I met him more recently when he came to Australia to consecrate Mar Benyamin, the bishop of Melbourne, and Mar Awraham, the bishop of Western Europe. He is a good friend of Australia and a wonderful leader of Assyrians around the world. I was particularly honoured and pleased to meet him on my visit to Iraq, in Erbil, and to have lunch with him—as was my adviser, Ninos Aaron—and to talk about the plight of Assyrians in Iraq. I pay tribute to him because he has announced, rather unusually for a patriarch, his retirement from the office due to ill health. The election of a new patriarch will occur later in the year, and we look forward to welcoming that new patriarch to Australia after their election—I have no doubt fairly early in their reign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Assyrian leaders in Australia, particularly Hermiz Shahen and David David, who lead the Assyrian National Council. They join us in the chamber today, together with other leaders of the Australian Assyrian community. It does not matter what the organisation is called or what letters go into the organisation; what matters is what's in their heart, and what's in their heart is leadership of the Assyrian people. I welcome them and thank them for their generations of leadership of the Assyrian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the member for Fowler, who will second this motion, and his longstanding commitment to the Assyrian people in his time in this House, which will, as he has announced, soon come to an end. I know the Assyrian people would want me to thank him for his leadership. I thank in advance those honourable members opposite for what I expect to be their support of the Assyrian people as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I second the motion. I thank my colleague the member for McMahon for moving this motion and I welcome all our Assyrian constituents who are here today. The simple fact is that Assyrian and Chaldean families have long made their home in my electorate of Fowler and in the electorate of McMahon. Since the 1980s, they've been coming to Australia in greater numbers under various humanitarian, refugee and family reunion visas. The Australian Assyrian community has made a significant contribution to our nation. That's because they are some of the most hardworking, industrious and dedicated people to migrate to this great country of ours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite migrating to Australia, this vibrant Assyrian community have not forgotten where they came from, their homeland, and particularly not the struggles of their people. The Assyrian community of Iraq, as we've just heard, have shown great strength and resilience in the face of extraordinary tyranny and adversity. I commend the Australian Assyrian community for their campaigning and tireless efforts in support of the Assyrian people facing such a terrible plight in the Middle East. I take the opportunity of acknowledging Hermiz Shahen and David David and all the members of the Assyrian National Council of Australia. I want to refer particularly to Ms Carmen Lazar and the Assyrian Resource Centre for their ongoing advocacy and the extraordinary role that they play every day for the Assyrian community settling in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only last week that David and Hermiz, together with Carmen, met with the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs to discuss the ongoing and pressing issues facing the Assyrian people of Iraq. During the meeting, they raised the possibility of Australia playing a bigger role in the settlement of Assyrians and other religious minorities from Iraq in this country. I know this approach is particularly supported by His Beatitude Archbishop Mar Meelis Zaia, as well as His Grace Archbishop Nona of the Chaldean Catholic Church. My community in Western Sydney has played a very constructive and welcoming role in settling refugees in this country, particularly with a majority of refugees coming from the Middle East now calling our area home. I must acknowledge the great work of Carmen Lazar and the Assyrian Resource Centre and thank Carmen for her extraordinary efforts and assistance in settling migrants and refugees from the Middle East.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade, the Assyrian people have been forced to abandon the region in Iraq where their culture and traditions have flourished for over 6,000 years. Many Assyrians have been forced to flee from their homes in cities into remote villages, where unfortunately there's limited access to health, education and other essential services. These families are living in very harsh conditions with few available resources and certainly no hope of returning to their homes. The recent attacks on Assyrian villages in Iraq, which have threatened the lives of many and left places of religious and cultural significance in ruins, demonstrate that the survival of the Assyrian culture and identity is clearly under threat. There are reports that the situation is so dire that the Assyrians of Iraq have declined in number by a staggering 90 per cent over the past decade. From an estimated 1.5 million in 2003, they are now just over 150,000. We can only pray that those remaining in Iraq do get the opportunity for a new start in life, free from the threat of persecution and free to practise their religion and cultural identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ongoing political turmoil in Iraq leaves me with great fear for the plight of the Assyrians and other religious minorities living there. While the threat of ISIS may have been removed, the Assyrians, Christians and other religious minorities unfortunately continue to live in fear under increasing threat from various militias controlling local areas, particularly throughout the Nineveh Plains. We hear reports of curfews being imposed upon them as well as harassment and abuse. Like many, I welcomed the statement by the Iraqi government in 2016 to recognise the aspirations of the indigenous Assyrians, leading to an in-principle agreement to establish an autonomous region. I call on the Iraqi government to give effect to that decision of 2016 and provide a safe haven for the Assyrian people. We cannot abandon people to whom our civilisation owes so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I'd like to begin by thanking the member for McMahon for moving this motion. Respectfully, as far as I'm aware, there isn't a very large Assyrian population—in fact, I suspect there is virtually no Assyrian population—in the federal electorate of Goldstein. But I'm standing here to support this motion from a position of principle—the principle that all people have a place on this earth and have a right to the basic tenets of freedom and security in live their lives. This is a considered position, based on the principle that if you wish to have a society which is cohesive and sustainable then decentralisation of governance and control, and self-determination are critical for all people. This principle is to make sure we all understand that it doesn't matter who you are—the basis of your ethnicity or your social, religious, sexual orientation or gender identity—everybody has a place in this world and the right to be treated with decency and respect, and everybody has a right to a place to call home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the basis on which I support this motion. The spirit of it is quite clear: the Assyrian people, particularly those who are living in Iraq, have experienced discrimination and violence, and they deserve a place which they can call home and to be safe and secure in their lives. The reality is that that hasn't been their recent history. As a consequence of that, we have people who have felt persecuted and discriminated against simply on the basis of who they are—both because of their heritage and, more critically, because of their religious beliefs. There's no place for that in this world—I'm sure you also share that view, Deputy Speaker Zimmerman—and there is certainly no place for it in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you are the custodians of a lived heritage which extends for thousands of years—in Iraq for 6,000 years—it isn't just the custodianship of a heritage and culture which you want to keep alive but it's one that we as a common people and humanity should wish to keep alive. Survival of culture, traditions and history rests so much in the continued living of culture, particularly around languages. When people are isolated or separated from their country or land and don't have the capacity to coexist peacefully then that language, tradition and culture diminishes progressively. That makes humanity worse off, not just the custodians who lose their identity and their sense of cultural significance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, as you know, this comes from a position of principle, as well as my Armenian heritage and some of the tragedies which befell them as a minority group in some communities—with consequences that have befallen them throughout history because of isolation, discrimination and persecution of them because of their history and traditions. Of course, coming from the Goldstein electorate I represent the third-largest Jewish community in Australia. There is another community which knows very well the lived experience of people being treated like that—used, abused and persecuted—because of their religion, ethnic heritage and identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to the heart of a speech I gave in this parliament only last week, extending on the recent speech by the Prime Minister to the United Israel Appeal. He talked specifically about the horrors of identity politics. That's when we cease to see people through their common humanity and start to identify them through their identity. That can be used both to bolster or to persecute, and we can lose sight of what brings us together as a people. Of course it's our common humanity that builds the bridge between us when we sometimes have differences in our history and our traditions—that's to build a more perfect humanity for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It starts with acknowledging and understanding people's basic right to live out their lives. It's that sense of commonality and equality between all people, regardless of their background; their right to safety and security; their right to be free to exercise their conscience as they see fit; and, of course, to manifest that consistently with respect for the rights and freedoms of others. When those principles are violated, it isn't just those who are the victims of it individually but it's a violence that's perpetrated on all of us. That's the basis on which there's validation of harm that can be done to any person, simply because of who they are, their background and their right to exist. That's why we must always stand up on these important issues—we must stand up for a common sense of humanity—particularly for the Assyrian people and Christian minorities in Iraq. That is why we stand with them today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I too rise to speak on and support this motion. I thank the member for McMahon for raising such an important issue, an issue we should speak out on, and I acknowledge his commitment to the vibrant, diverse community that he represents, which is very similar the community in my electorate of Adelaide. I would also like to welcome the Assyrian leaders and community from around Australia who are here today. What happens around the world directly affects us and our communities here in Australia. That is why advocating for peaceful resolutions in other countries is also good for us here in Australia. This is precisely the purpose of this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Assyrians in Iraq are an ethnic and linguistic minority group. They are the indigenous peoples of Upper Mesopotamia. Most of the world's two to four million Assyrians live around their traditional homeland, which comprises parts of northern Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran. According to a report by the Centre for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Assyrian people have been repeatedly victimized by genocidal assaults over the past century… Massacres, rapes, plundering, cultural desecrations, and forced deportations were all endemic. Around 750,000 Assyrians died during the genocide, amounting to nearly three quarters of its pre-war population. The rest were dispersed elsewhere, mostly in the Middle East–</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">but all around the world. When we think of the Middle East and the conflicts that have taken place over the past few years, we have to remember that the Christian minorities in the Middle East are some of the oldest Christian religions, ongoing, since the birth of Christ—some of the oldest Christian religions in the world—and that population has been diminished, gradually, slowly and systematically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today I join members on both sides of the House in calling on the Turkish government to immediately cease its military campaign in civilian areas of northern Iraq, which has resulted in the evacuation of dozens of Assyrian villages and the displacement of thousands of Assyrians. This is something that has gone on for too long and must stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that 60,000 Assyrians, and maybe more, have settled here in Australia. I know that our Australians of Assyrian descent are desperate, as all of us are, to see peace for their people. Everyone has the right to live in peace and to live in harmony. We must speak out for the fundamental human rights of all people, including minorities, such as the Assyrian Christians. That includes their freedom to practise their linguistic, cultural and religious traditions. That is why I too call for a protected enclave, as we have heard, in the Nineveh Plain for the Assyrian people. As we heard previously from members, this could take a number of forms, including an independent state or autonomous region of a city state. However, it must guarantee a safe haven, and stop the annihilation of the Assyrian people. Governments of all persuasions here in Australia must speak out on human rights violations, and today we need our government here as well to speak out for the Assyrian people and other persecuted minorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to talk about our aid budget, which has been assisting people in the Middle East. Australia's aid budget has shrunk under this current government. In 1995 Australia was ranked ninth in the list of OECD countries; in 2020, we were ranked 21st. So more aid is needed to assist these people. We have a moral obligation to help countries and to help people around the world, such as the Assyrian people, who have suffered immensely through wars, destruction and the displacement of people—things that are unacceptable today, in a modern world. We need to stop this, we need to speak out and we need to ensure that these people have the same rights as everyone else to practise their linguistic, cultural and religious traditions, and to live in peace.</span>

The 60,000 Assyrian Christians have been taken into the bosom of this nation. Mesopotamian history goes back thousands of years. This country's history goes back thousands of years. We know there are paintings that are some 60,000 years old in this country. You also have an enormously long history in the Middle East. So, you've come into the bosom of a country that has a long history. The Assyrians in this country are not only making a great contribution; they are also leaders throughout our communities, which we appreciate very much. This nation loves its multicultural being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also recognises the oppression of Christians around the world, especially, in this case, in the Middle East. I have never been dispossessed. I live in this country that has freedom of movement and freedom of religion. While our values, our relationships with one another and the respect we have for one another are sometimes tested, we live in a world that has not suffered the dispossession and the attacks that this community has suffered in Iraq. I want to recognise that today. I don't come from a place where I have stood in your shoes, because I can't. It comes from my heart. I've grown up in this country and have only observed and heard and cared about what was happening to my fellow Christians around the world, especially in Iraq. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have stood the test of time. You still exist today. You are part of hundreds of generations. We need to send a message to those we can. Australia has reasonable influence. We're not without influence. You're a part of that influence. You, as a community—and I'm talking about the Assyrian Australians—are very important. Australians with an Assyrian heritage are extremely important to the families within the Assyrian community because you are all connected back to your homeland, even though you're in the bosom of this great south land. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As members of parliament we are saying to you that we actually care about what is happening. The member for McMahon didn't bring this to the table in this green part of the parliament for no good reason. He brought it to the table because there's an issue here that we as a nation recognise needs to be addressed. When you're in pain, we're in pain. When you're suffering, we're suffering. We're recognising that. If a part of our community is suffering, it means we're all suffering. You are very much a part of the Australian community, and I talked about our having taken you into the bosom of this nation. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SIMMONDS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I'm pleased to present the report today on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and our inquiry into COVID-19, criminal activity and law enforcement. You only had to read the newspapers last week to appreciate the insidious threat that organised criminal gangs pose to Australian families. As chairman of the Law Enforcement Committee, I want to commend AFP officers for the unprecedented success of Operation Ironside, as detailed last week, which has smashed and disrupted OCGs operating in Australia, with more than 200 arrests, more than 500 charges laid and 3.7 tonnes of drugs, 104 weapons and $44 million in cash and assets seized.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as Australians have had to adapt to the challenging circumstances during COVID-19, the committee's report demonstrated OCGs have likewise been resilient in adapting their criminality to suit the COVID environment. For example, the committee heard concerning evidence of OCGs, during COVID lockdowns, when traditional supply chains were disrupted, exploiting the largely unregulated home food delivery industry to distribute illicit drugs. To counteract OCG attempts to exploit the industry and use it to transport illegal drugs, the committee has recommended the government investigate whether clear chains of movement and possession can be established in the home food delivery industry to reduce its potential for exploitation by organised crime groups. While that is an example of the way in which criminal elements have adapted, we are pleased to report there are also positive examples of how law enforcement agencies are adapting as well, with the committee endorsing the greater cooperation between jurisdictions and agencies that has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and recommending this continue while the COVID-19 threat remains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear to the committee that, during COVID-19, criminals took advantage of the increased need for certain products and engaged in distributing and selling counterfeit and substandard pharmaceutical and personnel protective equipment. The online criminal marketplace is extremely adaptable. In April 2020, within weeks of the pandemic starting, a snapshot of the illicit market for COVID-19 related products, conducted by ANU, found 645 listings, including 222 unique listings of COVID-19 related products across 12 markets. While the committee found the government's suppression of the virus and rollout of the vaccine in a free and transparent manner has dampened the marked for fraudulent vaccines and PPE gear, the committee will maintain a watching brief via an open inquiry on these criminal markets and the efforts of our law enforcement agencies to combat them. As the COVID-19 pandemic and response enters subsequent phases, it may indeed open up new markets of fraudulent activities for OCGs related to fake vaccination documentation, forged negative test results, doctored exemption certificates or other COVID related documentation, and this will require constant vigilance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, by far the most concerning aspect of the committee's inquiry was the rise of, prevalence of and challenges in relation to online and cyber-related crime. Cybercriminals have demonstrated they are adept at exploiting vulnerabilities and, especially, at impersonating the government by rapidly amending scams to align with government messaging on COVID-19. While the measures put in place by law enforcement and government agencies successfully limited the effectiveness of those scams, it is clear that there is a desperate need for more public education on the prevalence and risk of scams and frauds, and the committee has recommended a further education campaign on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is also deeply concerned that there has been a significant rise in online child exploitation during the pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including movement restrictions and increased online activity and related socioeconomic factors, has amplified the risk of vulnerable children being exploited online. Law enforcement agencies have also warned of the rising use of encrypted communications by OCGs and perpetrators of online sexual abuse. Although the use of encrypted communications by criminals is not new—the recent Operation Ironside has demonstrated this—it shows what an important tool these encrypted communications are to OCGs and how brazen they are on them in coordinating their activities. The committee recommends therefore that the Australian government consider whether new legislation is needed to address the rapidly evolving use of end-to-end encryption and anonymising technology by organised crime groups to ensure greater prospects of successful prosecution of those involved in malicious cyberactivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee acknowledges the important and ongoing work of law enforcement agencies to adapt to new responsibilities and duties they've had to face during the COVID-19 pandemic. While law enforcement has risen to this challenge, the committee acknowledges that these extra pandemic duties have stretched law enforcement resources and resulted in delays in other areas of criminal investigation. The committee supports government, state and territory police forces and police representative bodies in exploring potential strategies and arrangements for sharing police workforces nationally to increase their capacity and capability during emergencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also believes the proposal of a national police reserve force has merit and could be a solution to the rapid expansion of police forces during a national emergency. We recommend governments at the state and national level collaborate to explore the proposal to establish a reserve force, particularly of retired and former officers, to be utilised in national emergencies to supplement law enforcement resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was deeply concerned about reports of malicious acts perpetrated against police and other frontline workers while carrying out their COVID-19 duties, which are potentially exposing those workers to COVID-19. While the transmission of COVID-19 is already a criminal offence under general law provisions in state and territory jurisdictions, the committee has recommended that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments jointly undertake to review and ensure adequate provisions exist to enable offenders to be mandatorily tested if they are knowingly exposing a law enforcement officer to a communicable disease through the act of biting or spitting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the committee members very much for their time. I acknowledge the deputy chair for her extraordinary work on this as well. Thank you to the witnesses and law enforcement agencies for their participation and to the secretariat staff. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  by leave—I also rise to commend this report to the House today, along with the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Law Enforcement, as the deputy chair of that committee. The committee canvassed a range of issues about how COVID-19 has impacted law enforcement and criminal activity. We heard from a number of witnesses who all attested to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted on crime, particularly organised and transnational crime and online criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes eight recommendations across a breadth of issues. Recommendation 8 in particular addresses the increase in family and domestic violence during COVID-19. There are also recommendations around the security and safety of the vaccine rollout and recommendations around the exploitation of the food industry, particularly the food delivery industry, by organised criminal groups as well as other recommendations which the chair just spoke about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry has had a particular outcome of leading to another inquiry that the law enforcement committee is currently undertaking into the security of vaccines, and by 'security' we're talking here about the physical security of vaccines and the integrity of the vaccine rollout. I must stress that it is not sufficient to only talk about the safety of vaccines without also talking about the security of the vaccine rollout, so this inquiry, which is currently being conducted, will look into issues of potential scams around vaccines, potential availability of fake vaccine certifications on the dark web as well as the physical security of vaccines both in Australia and in the Pacific region. Criminals will always look for points of weakness that they can exploit in any kind of chain. It would be naive to think that in a pandemic situation they will not also look at points of weakness that they can exploit to further their illegal activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to commend and thank all the members of the committee, including the chair. I'd also like to thank the previous chair, the member for Hughes, who was in the position of chair when we started this particular inquiry. I'd like to thank him for allowing me to call this inquiry and for the bipartisan way in which he conducted the committee—as does the current chair. I'd also like to thank the secretariat for their hard work on this report; the witnesses and the law enforcement agencies who came to give evidence. I commend this report and its recommendations to the House. I look forward to seeing some of these recommendations implemented by the government.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's third report for 2021. Report No. 3 of 2021 considers one proposal referred to the committee in April 2021. The proposal is the Department of Defence's North Queensland Mid-Term Refresh Program, with approval sought from the committee to carry out works at RAAF Base Townsville, Townsville Field Training Area and HMAS Cairns. The estimated cost of this project is $111.2 million, excluding GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The North Queensland Mid-Term Refresh Program aims to meet the immediate and essential base sustainment needs and address compliance and capability requirements at all three sites. This will be achieved through the provision of vital estate maintenance and upgrades, including the creation of new access points to the Townsville Field Training Area and additional accommodation at RAAF Base Townsville. The committee was pleased to hear from Defence that all three sites are categorised as 'enduring basis' or 'training areas' with no current plans for divestment in the foreseeable future. The committee recommends that the House find it expedient that the Department Of Defence's North Queensland Mid-Term Refresh Program proceed. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021. I see this bill as particularly important to people across my electorate and also the electorate of Grey—and it's good to see the member for Grey here, and the member for Durack—where we represent the vast farming communities and an agricultural sector which has really propelled the economic recovery that we've seen since mid last year following the COVID shutdowns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular bill is one of the final elements of the radical simplification of the farm household allowance, which is a result of the 2018 independent farmer-led review. As we all know, farm income is volatile and based on uncertain yields, prices and of course the factor of the weather that we can never predict. Under the previous arrangements, farmers were asked to make predictions about their farm household income for the year ahead, which, as we all know, is particularly difficult. And when farmers acting in good faith got this wrong, the business income reconciliation process would make them liable for a debt. This bill is now addressing historical business income reconciliation debts, and will give relief to up to 5,300 farmers. It will also maintain the farm household support as a time-limited payment, with farmers and their partners eligible to receive the allowance for four years in every 10. The farm household allowance will continue to put money on the table when times are tough, allowing farmers to consider the right course of action for their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I came to this place, I was a farmer for 25 years in a wonderful farming area, Katanning, in Great Southern in Western Australia. We would reliably get 450 millimetres of rainfall annually, but, even given that, we experienced the highs and lows of seasons and prices. It is difficult for people to deal with those ups and downs, particularly when they are under extreme financial pressure, and that is what the farm household support program does. It gives people in that situation the dignity of being able to put food on the table, feed their families and keep their businesses operating until things improve, as they often do—although, unfortunately for some, the seasons don't turn around in time for them to save their farm businesses. This is important support the government provides to the farming community, and I certainly commend the changes that have been made here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk more broadly about farming practices and how the farming sector has adapted, particularly in the south-west of Western Australia, where the climate has dried somewhere between 30 per cent and 40 per cent since the 1960s. I will note that the driest decade in my district happened between 1890 and 1900, as per the post office records. The average was about 375 millimetres of rain for that decade. We then saw a rapid increase through to 1960, where we averaged 550 millimetres of rain for that particular decade. Average rainfall figures have fallen since those peaks; they are now around 425 millimetres for the last decade. The member for Grey, who is in the chamber, is a farmer, so he will be aware that these weather cycles change. We don't understand the weather or the climate, I don't believe, at this particular point in time. We don't know why that increase in rainfall between 1900 and the 1960s occurred, and I'm not sure that we understand why there has been a diminution of rainfall over the last 40 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of that, we've had to adapt. The farming system across my region in the Great Southern, and of course across Australia, has had to adapt to changing climates, be they in the shorter term, a five- or 10- year horizon, or over the longer term, a 50- to 100-year horizon. I take my hat off to the farming community for the way they've adapted. The most critical adaptation or change in farming systems, which has been adapted worldwide, began in the south-west of Western Australia. A good friend of mine Ray Harrington developed the no-till farming system. Ray Harrington has been recognised for his work, with an Edison science award in New York—one of the most prestigious science awards that can be granted. It recognised what was a generational change in farming systems. When I first went farming in the mid-1980s, we used to cultivate the country. We used to work it up, we used to work it back, and then we would sow it. That process, over a medium-sized farming program, might take a month to six weeks. In the process of doing that, every time we turned the soil, the wind would evaporate what moisture might be in the soil. Our sowing date, instead of sowing in early May when the first rains came, we would be sowing in early to mid-June when the growing season was already four to six weeks into it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crop-growing farms in my area, in my state and, I think it would be fair to say, across the nation have evolved. It is now this no-till or one-pass farming system. That effectively means that, with the use of the chemical glyphosate—I'll come back to glyphosate and the importance of glyphosate in the system. By killing the weeds chemically and sowing the crop on the first rains, what we're seeing is less soil erosion, less fuel being used in this cultivation process and much greater yields from the available rainfall, because we're not wasting it, we're not wasting growing-season time and we're not wasting the moisture being evaporated as we cultivate and pulverise the soil and dry it out. So this particular innovation created by a farmer in my electorate, at West Arthur, or Darkan, has been revolutionary and it has really changed the landscape for farmers dealing with a drying climate, dealing with drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we see these crippling droughts on the east coast where it simply doesn't rain. In Western Australia we don't have drought to that extent, although 20 shires across my electorate were drought declared in the most recent round, under the definition of less than 50 per cent annual mean rainfall over the previous 18 months. Twenty out of my 38 shires were drought declared, and I know that many in the member for Durack's and the member for Grey's electorate were as well. That recognised that serious drop-off in rainfall, but Western Australia still produced a reasonably good crop of around 9.8 million tonnes, which is actually above the long-term average, despite the fact that many of our shires were seriously drought declared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within that cohort of farmers who produced an average or slightly above average crop, there were many who were suffering severe financial stress. Of course, the financial stress is only one part of drought and low rainfall. The other part is the issue and the mental challenges of continually feeding and watering livestock. Carting water for livestock is a really soul-destroying job. You do it every day to give the livestock a drink, but you know you will have to do it tomorrow and the next day, and it's not actually making you any money or increasing your production; you're just keeping that stock alive, keeping them ticking along until it finally does rain. When you look at the weather forecast at the end of March and they're saying there's nothing in sight for months ahead, it's really soul destroying; it's really difficult for farmers to keep going under those circumstance. That's why for those farmers who are in financial difficulty and having to deal with these other issues it's so important that this farm household support program continues. It supports those farmers and provides them with the dignity of being able to support their families and keep food on the table. Many of them, when the seasons turn around—I've got to say I don't think I've ever seen a season as good as the one we're currently having in Western Australia. We have come off two or three pretty tough years, but this season we've seen general rains across the Western Australia Wheatbelt. I don't think there's an area, including right up in the northern Wheatbelt in the member for Durack's electorate, that hasn't received great rains—although that also came with a cyclone, which has caused a lot of difficulty for those farmers around Northampton through to the Kalbarri area. I really feel for those people. I know the member for Durack has been up there providing support and I think perhaps even the Prime Minister visited that area to provide support for those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rains across Western Australia this year have been exceptional. There are predictions—and it's still early days; we are in the middle of June. There were times previously when we'd only just finished seeding the crop in mid to late June. This year, the crops are knee-high already, and the prediction of a 20 million tonne crop for Western Australia I think, if anything, is a little bit conservative. I've never seen a season where the rainfall has been so general and widespread in every area right across the eastern Wheatbelt, which is, once again, part of the member for Durack's electorate. It's been getting terrific rains. I'm hearing some complaints from farmers about getting bogged, and I say, 'Well, that's not a bad problem to have.' It's frustrating, and I've been in that situation—where you're looking at a machine that's up to its axles in mud, and you think, 'How am I ever going to get that out?' It is frustrating, but, as the expression around our area goes, there's more money in mud than in dust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a terrific season across the Wheatbelt of WA this year, and I look forward to some terrific results. There will still be some challenges. We've got a good early start, but that does not in itself make a great season. We need some finishing rains. We need to dodge the frosts, which can often lead to some crippling financial losses for individual properties, if a particular crop is flowering at a particular time when we receive a frost. That has happened to our farming business on many occasions. It's pretty tough to get up one morning in early October and see that 50 per cent of your income for the year just disappeared overnight due to a frost. So we've got a long way to go, but Western Australia is certainly on target for a great season and, from what I'm reading, I understand that the east coast is having some great rains and looking at a great season. I'm not a hundred per cent sure about South Australia, but, hopefully, some of the rains that are coming through WA are getting into South Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill is about writing off the debts for those 5,120 farmers who incurred a debt because they estimated their income for the coming year at a lower level than it eventually ended up being. They've ended up with a debt because, in good faith, they had estimated that they would require that funding. This bill writes off that debt and gives those farmers some breathing space. Hopefully, with the good season we're seeing this year, they'll get back on their feet and will get up and away again and won't require the support next time around.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021. As we've heard, in relation to the farm household assistance program, which provides time-limited, means-tested income support to farmers and their partners experiencing financial hardship, this bill outlines the criteria for debt waiver for people who have overestimated or underestimated their income during the period of assessment. Farmers are eligible for the farm household assistance program for a maximum of four years, recorded as a 1,460 day clock, in every 10-year period. These days do not need to be consecutive and can be taken only if, and when, needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, farm household assistance recipients' income estimate was reconciled annually through the business income reconciliation, and that determined whether a recipient received a top-up payment or no adjustment or had incurred a debt. This was removed from the act with effect from 1 July 2020 as part of a process to simplify farm household assistance following a 2018 independent review. While this business income reconciliation was removed in 2020, some farm household assistance recipients incurred debts from this process between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2020 or have not yet been assessed. This bill will waive certain classes of debts, and I'm sure that will be an enormous relief to those people who have had this hanging over their heads for some time. This will certainly assist farmers suffering financial hardship and eliminate the negative effects of the BIR process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this will assist farmers, there is far more that the government should be doing. You don't have to look far today to see that the National Party, who are meant to be the party for farmers and who are meant to be looking after the country's farmers, have been a bit distracted and are not doing anything about the mice plague because they've had leadership issues happening. What we've been seeing, unfortunately, is a government that is so focused on itself, so focused on its internals and so focused on the politics that it is not actually helping people. When it comes to our farmers, it's hard to imagine anything more devastating than the plague of mice we're seeing across New South Wales. It's in huge proportions and, for farmers, it's absolutely devastating. It needs federal government action, but Senate estimates last month revealed that the Morrison government had no plan for a national response to this plague at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has written to the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management—presumably he is still the minister for agriculture and will not change portfolios, but who will know?—calling for a national response to this growing crisis, which is costing farmers millions and hurting regional communities. This week it was revealed that the Nationals New South Wales minister for agriculture had also called for a federal response. It is beyond the capacity of the state of New South Wales to deal with, and it needs national assistance. The Morrison government needs to listen to the growing caucus of voices calling for a national response to the horrific mouse plague. They really need to do this now. But, as I said, unfortunately, when we've had an obviously distracted National Party not standing up for the interests of farmers, you can see what's been let go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All year the government has criticised the states, but as soon as they ask for help this government just says, 'Well, it's not our problem.' We saw it over COVID and now we're seeing it with mice. In the next meeting of federal, state and territory agricultural ministers they need to have dealing with this plague on the top of their agenda. It's time for the minister for agriculture to show some leadership—perhaps that's somewhat ironic today—and help farmers facing this plague. Last week the former Acting Prime Minister outlined his solution to the mouse plague when he claimed that the best way of doing that was to perhaps rehome mice into cities. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They should be rehomed into their inner-city apartments so that they can nibble away at their food and their feet at night and scratch their children at night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a disgraceful response from the former Acting Prime Minister, who refused to lift a finger to help communities in need. Let's see if the new leader of the National Party is going to be any different. The absent Prime Minister doesn't hold a hose, the then Acting Prime Minister doesn't set a mouse trap. Instead of letting the mice scratch children in the cities or the region, how about we try to eradicate them? How about the federal government does its job and assists farmers in ending this plague?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I really wanted to speak on this bill is I particularly want to speak about an issue that is deeply affecting the farmers in my constituency, and particularly the magnificent potato farmers that are on some of the most productive, beautiful land that Victoria has and are producing spuds around Newlyn, Dean, Mount Prospect and areas in that community. It has rich, beautiful, volcanic soil, and we've been producing potatoes out of that region for almost five generations in the well over 100 years that families have farmed in that area. My home is very lucky to have avoided some of the challenges of drought and other issues of late that have beleaguered some of our other states, but it doesn't mean that we don't have issues. I'll talk in a separate forum about some of the horrendous storm damage we've had across our community, including across some of our potato farming communities. But today I particularly want to talk about a project that is really hitting home, and that's the Western Victoria Transmission Network Project and what that's doing to farmers in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transmission lines are to stretch about 120 kilometres from Melbourne's west to north of Creswick before carrying on to Bulgana. They're pretty big, with towers that are going to be the height of the MCG. They're not normal powerlines but are designed to carry far heavier voltage, and they're substantial. They're huge and are going to cut through residential growth areas. But particularly I want to draw the House's attention to their cutting through some of the most productive land in this country. One of the problems that we've seen with the way in which this project has been undertaken is that there has been no assessment or understanding of the value of horticultural land to this country and the impact of putting industrial sized powerlines across this productive land. In particular, there is the issue of the new terminal station. This is not a small terminal station; this is a substantial piece of infrastructure. Some have said it will be about 12 MCGs in size, taking up substantial acreage. You would think, if you're building a terminal station, that you would look to build it on industrial land or industrial zoned land; it is an industrial project. But, no, AusNet, who've won the tender for this project from the Australian Energy Market Operator, have decided that they're going to put this terminal station right smack in the middle of some of the most productive horticultural land in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're putting a terminal station in the middle of Mount Prospect. There is no industrial zoned land anywhere near this. It is right in the middle of farmland, where we grow potatoes for McCain and farmers have been growing potatoes for over 100 years. It is beautiful soil. It is not marginal farming country. It is not farming country that is being grazed. I understand that when you have powerlines or wind farms it's often easier to do grazing under them. We've got headers going under there and we've got watering systems that need to go under there. It is a substantial impost on the community to put the powerlines there, let alone to put this massive terminal station in the middle of that area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I headed out there and I met with the Stephens family, and I thank Frank and Colleen for hosting me at their home. I also thank Matthew and Peter for drawing my attention to what this means for their farmland in particular and to their concerns about not only the terminal station and what that means for their community but also what that means for future powerline projects and for their area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call very strongly on AusNet to reconsider this. What they've done—which I knew they would do from the start—is basically draw a line on a map to look at the easiest and most cost-efficient way to get this line across the countryside. They have then gone and tried to negotiate, as best they could, and they managed to find a farmer and worked away on them and got them to agree—for reasons that are deeply personal to them, being the last in their line of being able to farm on this land—to potentially sell their land. So they've just gone the easiest pathway. This is just ridiculous. In 2021 we should be looking at protecting and preserving our horticultural properties, because we have to produce food in this nation. If we don't produce food in this nation we will be heavily reliant on it coming from overseas—something that we learnt in COVID we should absolutely avoid at all costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this community in particular we have McCain, where all of the growers contract and sell their produce to. McCain are saying that the impact on the farmers, in particular, is that it will substantially threaten the viability of the McCain's plant in Ballarat and hundreds of jobs; that it will substantially limit the farming activities that can be undertaken on this land; that, whilst it's not prohibited entirely, it precludes certain forms of watering systems; and that it will have a significant impact on the financial viability of some of these farms. If you care at all about having McCain's hot chips, you will have a bit of an interest in this project, because it will mean that there will be farms that will become less productive and certainly far less efficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that I find incredibly frustrating about what AusNet have done—and I think this is something that, as a country, we are going to have to look at really seriously—is the fact that we are just doing the same thing other and over and over again when we are building powerlines. Why are we not thinking about where we can build this technology underground, where we can use battery storage to allow the fantastic renewable energy sources that we have throughout our country to be utilised in the areas in which it is being generated, so that we are, as country people, able to get access in a better way to the renewable energy sources that we have? But instead what we see with this project, and projects right the way across the country, including in the electorates of other members here, is that we are just going to build these great big powerlines smack across the country, including across horticultural land, without any thought to productivity or whether these powerlines would be better built underground or whether there is better technology we should be using for the transmission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the government, who is one of the decision-makers in this process, along with the Andrews state government—they are both the planning authority for this project—to actually tell AusNet to go back to the drawing board, particularly when it comes to this transmission station to be placed smack in the middle of Mount Prospect, some of the most productive farming land in the country. The community is up in arms about it and absolutely furious. I'm furious about it. It is not something that should be done. I suggest really strongly to AusNet that, whilst you think that you've taken the easiest pathway, it's not going to be an easy pathway at all, because those farming communities aren't going to sit by and just allow this to happen; I, as their federal member, am not going to sit by and just allow this to happen; and the communities that support and care about those farmers are not going to sit by and let this happen either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst I'm very pleased to speak on this bill, which is about farm household assistance and debt waivers, I'm not so pleased to have to raise in this place that the very livelihoods of the farmers at Mount Prospect, Newlyn and Dean—whose incredible work has kept us fed, and kept us fed through COVID—are now under threat.</span>

That's not because I'm an avid consumer—although I am—but, as I can assure the member for Ballarat, lots of potatoes grown in the seat of Barker head across the Victorian border. Thankfully, that remained open to heavy-vehicle freight throughout the various lockdowns so that the McCain factory could continue to supply hot chips to Australians all over. So if her constituents are experiencing problems with the production of potatoes, I can assure her that I have farmers who are ready, willing and able to double down and produce yet more South Australian potatoes for chipping at the McCain's factory. Indeed, some of those producers even produce in and around powerlines in relation to those very commodities. So I wish her well, but I want to make sure that anyone who is listening to the broadcast isn't in fear that we're in some risk of a shortage of potato chips around the country at any stage.

Something that those listening to the debate in the chamber would no doubt be aware of is that, from an economic perspective, this country is roaring back. But we need to pause for a minute because, as difficult as the recovery from the recession that has been induced by the one-in-100-year global pandemic is, in my electorate there were real issues which preceded pandemic. These were real issues preceding anyone ever being introduced to the concept of COVID-19, or any of us having really deeply thought that a global pandemic would wave its way onto our continent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those real issues were precipitated by a prolonged drought. I know that I speak for lots of members of this place when I say that those difficulties preceded the bushfire season that was so calamitous, as well as, obviously, the pandemic. These changes go back to those difficulties. The farm household allowance, for those who might not be familiar with it, is a payment that's made to farmers who lose their income on account of drought, or flood or unreasonable fluctuations in commodity prices. This is the concept, and it might be foreign to some, that a farmer invests a million dollars—and this is not uncommon in my electorate, given the scale of farming operations today—in seed and inputs. That farmer drills that million dollars directly into the soil. Then it's a matter of sitting and waiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, farmers are waiting for the rain. Some of them have described it to me as being a bit like taking a million dollars to the casino and putting it on black. Of course it's not; these are determined farmers who are at the innovative cutting edge. But the reality is that 'if it don't rain, it don't grow'. I've been with farmers when they've done that not once but twice. Imagine that? Imagine having the guts to take a million dollars worth of seed and inputs and drill them straight into the ground, only to see them fail? Two and three seasons ago the headers didn't leave the sheds: nothing grew. Imagine having the resilience and courage to take another million dollars worth of seed and other inputs and drill those into the ground again 12 months later? Of course a lot of these costs are fixed—they come along whether you reap a crop or you don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've sat with farmers on this. I'll never forget a discussion I had with one farmer, who told me: 'Tony, I'm about to go back to the bank for the third time. It's been two years and our financial position has worsened by greater than $2 million on account of two complete crop failures, and I'm about to do it again.' Aside from sitting with this person and thinking, 'You are incredibly brave,' the little Tony in my head—perhaps the rational one—was saying, 'You're perhaps crazy brave, but you are incredibly brave.' Then imagine me sitting there with that particular producer and that particular producer telling me that they'd had a discussion with the bank, and this was it: if it didn't rain, the bank would have to take the necessary action. Thankfully, it did rain. Those in this chamber may well know that we had a stunning season. I was pleased to visit that very same crop, during a crop competition, and I was so relieved. The resilience was measured by the smiles on these farmers' faces. The farm household allowance was the reason that that farming family could retain dignity over that 36-month period. The school fees got paid. There was food on the table. They had dignity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From time to time—and we saw it during the global recession—for reasons that are outside of their control, businesses suffer economic loss. In some cases, during this pandemic, it lasted for three months. In some cases, for businesses in my electorate, it might have lasted six months. For some businesses it continues. I acknowledge that. But, for the overwhelming majority of them, they saw this as a relatively short-term but very stressful interruption to their otherwise successful businesses. My farming enterprises face this from time to time. Most recently, on account of the drought, they faced it for 36 months straight. The necessary expansion to farm household allowance is taking place during this period. Of course, members in this place know that any farming enterprise can access the farm household allowance for four years in any 10. Through the most recent dry period, the prolonged drought, it was increased from two years to four. Both sides of this place should acknowledge that that has been a good thing, and it was done with the bipartisan support of my friends opposite. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, in order to have this system, there needs to be business income reconciliation. Farmers are expected to estimate what their likely income will be at the beginning of a financial year. That triggers the farm household allowance. Of course, if circumstances change, then there is potential for a debt to be raised. Perhaps, in certain circumstances, that's fine, but what we've got here is a situation where we've changed the rules. We've gone from three years in every 10 to four years in every 10, having done that to take account of the very difficult position that farmers in the prolonged drought found themselves in. It would have been unconscionable to do anything other than have another look at the debt waiver provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill do? It waives new business income reconciliation debts. It removes the requirement to recredit days of payment where a business income reconciliation debt was incurred. It allows a small number of farm household allowance recipients with existing BIR debts to repay these debts using the remaining FHA days. It maintains the time limit for payment to four years. That's very important. Nothing in this bill extends that four-in-10 rule. It provides refunds to FHA recipients who incurred part-day debts where that person was still entitled to some payment. Finally, it ensures that FHA recipients can still receive a top-up payment where eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its heart, the farm household allowance is about making sure we don't lose a generation of Australian farmers. I'm not someone who comes into this place and says that farmers aren't dealt a particularly attractive hand by the parliament. I think farmers have been dealt a particularly attractive hand. No other business can income-average over 10 years. No other business has access to provisions like the farm household allowance. Indeed, no Australian individual has access to that outside of the farming network. This is a provision which effectively says that we'll provide you with income support, notwithstanding we haven't asked you to sell your investment asset—in this case, the farm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No other Australian can expect the kinds of advantages that come with term investments linked to farming enterprises. These are particularly beneficial provisions. But they're established for a reason, and they have bipartisan support for a reason—that is, because this place knows, as do Australians, that farmers go out and face the kind of risk profile that I described earlier in my contribution. If we don't provide these kinds of safety measures, then we're not going have a generation of Australian farmers who will survive the vicissitudes of drought. So we need provisions like this. We need to remain flexible and cognisant of the real meteorological reality out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same kind of thinking that has allowed the Morrison government to lead 24 million Australians through the recovery. It's the kind of thinking that says you've got to apply a practical, pragmatic lens to the situation that you find. That situation, 18 months ago, was a one-in-100-year pandemic event. We had run strong budgets to that point and we had the fiscal firepower to lean in. Just as we lean in for farmers in relation to FHA, we leant in particularly for the business sector and their employees through the JobKeeper scheme. That is why, in my respectful submission, we are sitting at an unemployment rate in this country of 5.1 per cent, and it is projected to go even lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are employment challenges in my electorate today—absolutely there are. But they're not the ones I thought we'd experience 18 months ago. In my darker moments, 18 months ago, in quarantine at home, I thought to myself, 'How is our nation going to cope with an unemployment rate rising through 12 to 15 per cent?' That was worse than the projections, but I had a really pessimistic view; those on this side of the House who know me well know that I am the coalition pessimist! Thankfully, in this case, I wasn't proven right. It's not a product exclusively of decisions that have been made in this place; I give credit to the Australian people for where we've come to. They have shown the kind of resilience and can-do attitude that we know is quintessentially Australian. They couldn't have done any of that if we weren't prepared to effectively leverage the nation's books and debt position in favour of ensuring the economy didn't fall off a cliff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />As I said, in my electorate we face employment problems. But those employment problems aren't the 12 to 15 per cent unemployment rate I thought they'd be 18 months or so ago; they're now the strongest structural shortage in the labour market that I've ever seen in my lifetime. I'd hasten to suggest it's probably as short as it's ever been, except for the period directly after World War II. Of course, that was a point, I'm particularly keen to point out, when the Australian people turned effectively to continental Europe and said, 'If you have young, strong prospective Australians, send them to us.' My father was in that cohort. I'm incredibly proud of everything he has done. I think we're quickly coming to the point when we'll need to consider, post pandemic, something akin to that open stance in relation to unskilled labour into this country. Of course it's unlikely in 2022 to be an invitation to Europe, or at least one that wouldn't be necessarily openly accepted in that way, but I think we need to turn our attention to inviting prospective Australians, unskilled or otherwise, from other areas of our globe, including South-East Asia and the Pacific. That's how we'll solve the structural problem I have in my electorate. It's something we need to consider seriously.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  It's always tremendous to follow on from the member for Barker who understands what it's like to be part of a family that arrived from Europe. With his father and family farms, it's a great story that is replicated tens of thousands of times around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill, the farm household allowance has been a hallmark addition from this government that's been able to be on hand, ready to assist, in those times when our farming community simply has had no control over the outcome of the weather, whether it be drought, floods or storms, or a downturn in the milk price, which happened in 2016 when there was a serious misappropriation of the milk price. The dairy industry entered into one of these very rare situations where they had been, in fact, over quoting the price that they were paying the farmers over a period of some six to nine months and then, all of a sudden, these dairy companies effectively made the decision that they wanted their money back. This put hundreds and hundreds of farmers, right throughout Victoria and Australia, into a situation where they had all of a sudden accrued debts of many hundreds of thousands of dollars. This was something where our dairy farmers, producing all of these amazing dairy products, simply had nowhere to go; they were simply in a situation where they needed assistance. So, at that stage, the government was able to roll out the farm household allowance. It was a little bit over $20,000-odd for a couple, but it was effectively based around the concept that at least it could put food on the table and pay a few of those critical bills that needed to be paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are incredibly proud of our agricultural sector here in Australia. As we've entered the pandemic we've had many things to worry about, but we haven't had to worry about food always finding its way onto the shelves of our supermarkets. Somehow, mysteriously, it's just magically happened. Even in the absolute depths of the pandemic when we had all the lockdowns, we still had an agricultural sector and a processing sector that were continually able to put food on the shelves of our supermarkets for Australian families. That's something that we should never ever take for granted. So we have to look at this industry, our agricultural sector, and our manufacturing and processing sector. We have to value it and guard it with a genuine intent. That's what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is all about making sure that we can put a value on agriculture that understands the sector, understands that every now and again it is going to need a little bit of a help, a little bit of a hand up. We were able to put around 16,000 people on the farm household allowance. The vast majority of those 16,000 farmers are still operating their farms today in better times, when we've had some fantastic rainfall over the last couple of years and where we've had higher commodity prices, where we've had a big demand for our grain, and great sheepmeat and beef prices. So it's been a bit of a help all the way through. But, now that we've arrived at the time our farmers are being even more productive and actually paying down further debt, there is a small cohort that is being left with debts associated with farm household allowance. What this bill does is effectively waive those debts. If those debts were accrued by mistakes in relation to overestimating off-farm and other farm incomes, all of a sudden farmers have been receiving some farm household allowance that they may not have been entitled to, therefore amassing a debt. What we are doing here is finding the neatest, easiest way to effectively waive that debt to enable the farmers to get on with what they are doing so well here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, when you look at and compare Australia's opportunity to grow so much produce—to produce so much milk and dairy produce and also to grow so much fibre and to create some of the world's highest-quality wool—all of these attributes that we have in the agricultural sector are things that make Australia very, very strong and robust. Even though we've had all of these incredible setbacks recently, with drought, fires, floods and COVID, we still have this agricultural sector that is continuing to grow, and the outlook for our agricultural sector is still very, very positive. We have a $66 billion economy at the moment. A large chunk of that is based around our capacity to trade. The fact is that we've only just landed a new trading arrangement with Britain and the UK. That's going to be of amazing benefit and we'll continue to see this strong growth in the agricultural sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, many, many years ago, effectively did what was called a bit of a handshake agreement, which let New Zealand find its way into England to help supply our mother country, as it was back then, with a whole raft of dairy products. That arrangement has seen New Zealand be the beneficiary of those 70-odd million people who live in Britain. But now Australia has the opportunity to join in this market, and it also puts further pressure on the EU to secure that free trade agreement that we've been negotiating with them for many, many years. If in six months or 12 months we are able to finalise that trading arrangement with the EU, we are going to see so many of these farmers who have received the farm household allowance take their farming business to another level as well, with increased markets right around the world. I think the concept of forgiving these debts and enabling the recipients of farm household allowance to pay off these debts with future farm household payments is a commonsense move. It's going to enable these people to fix all this up without any major shocks to their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that we need to look at this in its entirety and just be very, very proud of the fact that whenever there have been floods, fires, droughts, COVID or whatever and whenever a downturn in a commodity price has hit our markets and our farming industries it has always been this government that has been there to support them. This is a commonsense piece of legislation. We've now made a slight change to a change that we made a few years ago, where we put a limit on how much assistance you could have. We've taken that out to any four years in any 10. That has also given our farming sector a little bit more flexibility, when you consider that some of these shocks come and go in a very short and sharp manner. That's also why we've made that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is going to help many of those people within the farming sector, as have some of the other changes that we've made along the way. We've actually increased the value that you are able to have tied up within your farming asset. That has gone out to $5 million, because, as we now know, many of these farms that are struggling to be economically viable in a given year are still incredibly valuable pieces of land, and we don't want to penalise people simply because they're sitting on an expensive asset. We don't want to effectively take away the support they need to operate and live their lives on a daily basis. As I say, this is not a lot of money but it is an incredibly important little bit of assistance that we can give our agricultural sector when they have issues that they have no control over. This is something that we need to be very, very clear about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad that the opposition are not going to oppose this bill. I'm glad that the farm household allowance has general support right around Australia. I'm glad that it is seen as a hand-up every now and again when our farmers have issues happen to them that they have no control over. I'm glad it is not seen as some lurk. I'm glad that it is quite a pure operation. I wish the bill a speedy passage through the House and I certainly hope that our farming communities continue to go from strength to strength.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  Water is, of course, the key to life for farmers in my region and all across Australia. We have seen how fortunes can turn when a little bit of rain comes and how dire things can get when we struggle through those years of dry. I was out at FarmFest just last week and it was fantastic. I was speaking to a supplier of heavy farm machinery and farm equipment. They've been going to FarmFest for nearly 10 years and this was the first time that they had seen a cheque at FarmFest. It was the first time that someone had actually stumped up and purchased a piece of equipment at FarmFest. I think that's a testament to the luck we have at the moment and the good fortune we have in our regions. We had that bit of rain and that has given us a good crop. But we don't forget how difficult it can be in those dry years. In those dry years government assistance is crucial in preventing mum and dad operations from going under due to circumstances out of their control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I would point out, in my region, that in talking at FarmFest with a lot of local farmers it's easy to forget that these are largely family-run operations. They are 700-acre soldier settlement blocks that were populated after the First World War, and then the Second World War, in my region. They're small blocks of land. They aren't giant multinationals. These are families who run their farms, who support the local communities, who send their kids to the local schools, whose use of the local medical facilities is so important to keeping these communities viable. This is what the farm household allowance is for—supporting farmers to stay on the land and producing some of the best food and fibre in the world. I remember going to supermarkets during my time in the UK and seeing New Zealand lamb being such a big thing in UK supermarkets. Now, isn't it great to hear, with the FTA with the UK, that we could maybe see Australian beef taking the same sort of status amongst UK shoppers. So it is so important that we take advantage of this and that we're there for our farmers during this opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy we're discussing today is one of the final elements of what we are calling a radical simplification of the FHA. It's a result of the 2018 independent farmer-led review, a review that farmers in my region were very vocal in as they experienced a tipping point to desperation after years of unrelenting drought. It has been drought after drought. We talk about the difficulties that the most recent droughts presented. I remember being out at Dalby looking at the cracks in that beautiful black soil out there that you could easily step ankle deep into. I remember the last big drought. I was down in Parkes in 2003 watching those tremendous dust storms roll in, the giant red clouds that came in and eventually went across Sydney and provided us with those amazing images at the time. We must remember that this is a cycle that will continue. It always has been here and always will be. We need to adapt to it and provide our farmers with the best possible support for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021 recognises that farm income, like the weather it's based upon, is volatile. It's based on uncertain yields and prices, and that very unpredictable Australian weather. Under previous arrangements we asked farmers to make very difficult predictions about their farm income for the year ahead. With so many factors to take in you would need a crystal ball to get this estimate correct. Of course farms take risks on this; they do. They purchase equipment. They sow crops. They prepare for opportunities. But that is a risk they're willing to take for their business, and that is what we encourage. What we shouldn't be doing is asking them to take risks that would bring them into debt through the FHA. It is wonderful to see the opposition so heartily in agreement that this is something very important that we can support our farmers with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When farmers acting in good faith get their predictions wrong, the business income reconciliation process is the mechanism that would put them into debt. Fundamentally I think we can all agree this isn't fair. This is a process of adding more stress to farmers who are already pushed to the brink. In this day and age we understand the challenges that these conditions provide to our mental health when we see groups like RU OK? or Are you bogged mate?—another great initiative out talking to farmers about their mental health. We understand that there are stresses involved here, and it's not fair that we add to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great challenges with farming—and I speak as someone who is the first in my line not to be born and raised on a farm, but I understand the challenges my family faced in this—is dealing with good times and bad times. In good times, the idea is that you put money away; you invest and build up. In bad times you see it through as best you can. This bill recognises that in bad times we've asked farmers to accumulate debt, and that's wrong. It was wrong and it was unfair, and the bill that we're discussing today addresses that; I think it's a very important step. In those good times, we need our farmers to invest, to build and to grow—to take advantage of opportunities like the FTA with the UK. It's a very important thing for us to do to support them in that. I think that very much speaks to the essence, certainly, of my side of politics, and I think it speaks more broadly to the Australian sense of a fair go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses historical debts and will give debt relief to up to 5,300 farmers. It will allow the minority of people who are owed a top-up payment to receive it and it will also maintain the FHA as a time-limited payment, with farmers and their partners eligible to receive the allowance for four years in every 10. I was always brought up with the understanding that we had seven-year cycles—that was a good rule of thumb—and that drought needed to be seen for that amount of time. I think it's important that we have a cap on this, but also recognise the weight that a prolonged drought can bring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will draw a line under a complicated process and ensure that recovery from drought, floods, bushfires and COVID-19 is not made harder for the small number of farmers who still have to repay their debts, those who have received another full year of payment for each BIR debt. There will still be options on the table, including payment plans to assist them in repaying their debt. This is to prevent double dipping and will ensure that no-one is entitled to more than the 1,460 days of farm household allowance. Again, we're making sure that this is very fair and can be applied across the industry as best as possible. This further strengthens fairness in the system and ensures it can continue to support farming families into the future. It's very difficult for us to acknowledge that there will be future droughts, but of course there will be. We have to look forward to those and understand they're something we can address. We can find ways to work through them and to support our farmers through them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very important, because this particular drought isn't over yet, especially in Queensland. As of 1 May, there were a total of 37 councils and three part-council areas which were drought declared, including the Toowoomba Regional Council, which overlaps almost directly with my electorate. It's very hard to get the feeling that we are in drought when driving through the Toowoomba region. Quite frankly, the country is looking absolutely spectacular—either coming up from the Lockyer Valley and seeing the beautiful green hills and the green cityscape or coming in from Dalby, looking at all the wonderful winter crops out through the fields. You get the understanding that things are happening, that it's a good time in our industry and that there's a sense of hope and optimism which comes with that rain. But it's still very much a green drought. With all the rain that we had recently, Lake Cooby Dam, one of our local dams, is still only at 31 per cent; before the rain it was at 30 per cent. So we're still in a situation where water is scarce; we're still going to have to work very hard to see our way through over the next couple of years, and we're certainly not through the drought. If anything, the water that we've had has put a little bit of moisture into the soil after long years of it being pulled out, but we certainly aren't into a situation now where we're in the clear. We have a long way to go and we need to recognise that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These drought declarations represent 65 per cent of the total land area of Queensland. That's a significant area. There are also 23 individual droughted properties in a further seven local government areas which are struggling. To all those farmers in those areas: this is a directly applicable bill that we're moving here today. I want those who are still waiting for rain to know that this government is committed to supporting them, both through this drought and into future droughts—as we will through other natural disasters. Simplifying this FHA process is one very commonsense, fair and sensible step that we can take to ensure that we stand with our farmers. The FHA will continue to put money on the table when times are tough, allowing farmers to consider the right course of action for their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are broader implications of this that are worth acknowledging, particularly for a place like Toowoomba, which is a hub for regional education and regional health services. These farming families come into Toowoomba—they always have and they always will—to send their children to school. I've spoken to several Toowoomba private school headmasters who are very used to having to deal with farming families through very tough years. They know they can't ask mum and dad to put the fees on the table that year, because they simply don't have them, but they also know that, when the good times come, those fees will be paid and the debts will be cleared. In a place like Toowoomba, we need to ensure that those farming families continue to come in, because it's the accumulated use of those services which makes our services so good. Our medical facilities, too, rely upon the patronage of a wide area of south-western Queensland—and northern New South Wales, for that matter. They rely on people coming to Toowoomba to seek the exceptional health care that is on offer there. Every step that we can take to reduce the burden on those farming families is something that we will feel on a much broader scale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point I'll make is that the timing of this could not be better. This is probably the first year since 2016 when farmers in my region not only have experienced a good summer crop but have seen it followed up by a winter crop. This is an exceptional time for us. It's a time of hope and prosperity, and it's a great opportunity for both sides of the House to stand united with farmers and show them that we are there, we do support them and we will continue to support them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  Life on the land can be very rewarding, and most farmers that I know wouldn't see themselves anywhere else. But, as we've seen time and time again, it can also be incredibly difficult. It can take a huge toll financially, emotionally, physically and mentally when, no matter the hours that are put in and despite the best-laid plans, so much hope is smashed due to factors outside farmers' control—namely, uncertain yields, price changes and unpredictable weather. In recent years we've seen fires, floods and droughts, and now we have COVID-19 and a mouse plague as well. Being married to a sheep and cattle farmer of many generations myself, I've certainly come to understand how volatile farm income can be and the stress that the constant unpredictability of that industry can put on a family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On our own farm we've had a pretty good year, with some decent rain, and with sheep and cattle prices high. But last year, when rain had been a bit scarce, we were feeding grain to those same sheep in February. And around 15 years ago, in very dry conditions, you could hardly give those sheep away. At our annual lamb sale, sheep prices then were down to about $2 per head. Wool, too, can be very volatile, with good markets in recent years now being affected by the impacts of COVID-19, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farming in Australia will always be a case of swings and roundabouts. The farm household allowance is a necessary payment for farmers and their families in hardship, and one that the government is committed to getting right as we continue to provide essential support for one of our most essential industries. We acknowledge that, under previous arrangements, we asked farmers to make difficult predictions about their farm income for the year ahead, which did result at times in farmers, after acting in good faith, becoming liable for a debt. Recognising this, we've already removed the business income reconciliation process that would make farmers liable for debt, which was a step in the right direction. Importantly, this bill today, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021, will now address that historical business income reconciliation debt, providing much-needed relief to over 5,000 farmers. The waiver means that most farm household assistance recipients will not have to pay back debts incurred due to inaccurately estimating future income while receiving the farm household allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, beyond waiving new BIR debt, this bill also removes the requirement to recredit days on payment where BIR debt is incurred, allows a small number of farm household assistance recipients with existing BIR debts to repay the debts using their remaining farmhouse allowance days, maintains the time limited payment to four years, or 1,460 days, in every 10 years and provides refunds to farm household allowance recipients who incurred part-day debts where the person was still entitled to some payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that since the 2018 independent farmer-led review of the farm household allowance, a number of reforms have already been implemented, including the passing of the three previous bills to implement changes, which were introduced over five tranches. These include, from 1 July 2019, profits from the fourth sale of livestock that are placed into a farm management deposit are not considered for the purposes of the income test for farm household allowance. The treatment of income from business was amended so that allowable deductions can be claimed against related income. From 16 December 2019, the off-farm income offset upper limit increased from $80,000 to $100,000. Farm losses can now be offset by off-farm income up to the $100,000 limit per couple, and eligibility for farm household allowance was extended from four years to four years in every 10-year period. From 25 March 2020, the 28-day time limit to conduct a farm financial assessment was removed, allowing case managers to take into consideration the complexity of the farm business and the availability of the person conducting the assessment. From 11 June 2020, anybody who qualifies for a payment can automatically receive the maximum amount. The assets test was simplified to a single amount of $5.5 million. Rural financial counsellors and farm consultants are able to complete the farm financial assessment, and the activity supplement increased to $10,000 per person and can be used for reasonable travel and accommodation to undertake the activities. From 1 July 2020, the requirement to undertake BIRs was removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government does understand the challenges faced by farmers. We understand what it means to work in a country that is so subject to the vagaries of weather, and we will always be here to support our farmers in their time of need. This legislation is an important step forward towards ensuring that this support is targeted to those most in need and takes away unnecessary worry for those already in very stressful situations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  As anybody in business knows, the first point to any business strategy, let alone a growth strategy, is to protect and leverage your core, to ensure that your core competency continues to be your strength. As you look at Australia, the agricultural sector is one of our core competencies, and we need to ensure that we continue to hold up that industry and leverage it as much as we can. Of course, it's easy for those who read the headlines to know that we're looking strong in terms of the winter crop—whether it be wheat, canola, chickpeas; you name it, the winter crop is looking pretty strong—but behind those headlines lies an enormous amount of challenge. As farmers in Australia know, they deal in a highly volatile environment. It doesn't matter whether it be the yield, the weather or the global prices, the everyday Australian farmer has to deal with a constant state of uncertainty, which is not at all easy for any business let alone those that also have to deal with drought, with flood, with storms, with fires, with COVID-19 and, indeed, now with mice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian farmer is the most resilient of our people, but it is amidst uncertainty that they must operate, and this is why this government introduced the farm household allowance scheme back in 2014—in recognition that the farmers need assistance. Now, they're tough; the Australian farmers are the toughest people you find. However, they too come up against financial hardship. That is why this farm household allowance was introduced. What that meant was that farmers were able to receive payments and, in the event of conditions improving, they could roll off those payments, ensuring that there was still some sort of preserved access available to them should conditions again go south.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any scheme, you need it to be reviewed and improved. In 2018 an independent review was taken of the farmhouse allowance scheme. It made recommendations to the government, and, true to form, this government again stepped up. Further support was allowed, and we tried to make the scheme even more accessible, easier for the farmer, and we delivered on that. Today, in this House, we debate the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021—another measure of amendment that we are taking on board to try to improve the ease of access and, more than anything, the fairness for the everyday farmer. Let's keep in mind that we are not talking here about a handful of people across the country. We've had 16½ thousand farmers—16½ thousand farmers!—and their partners accessed this household scheme since its introduction, but what we've found is there's another measure that could improve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What farmers do is they predict their income for the year ahead amidst all of those uncertainties. Then, after the year has gone and they've received some payments, due to their financial hardship, there is a reconciliation that's done based on actual income for the farmer. That business income reconciliation process obviously leads to discrepancy. What we have found is that where a farmer gets the prediction wrong, which one can understand, then, in the event of them receiving more payments than should have been due, the overpayment suddenly turns into a debt to the Commonwealth. That debt hangs over these farmers. And what we see through this amendment bill debated today is the waiving of those debts for up to 5,300 farmers and their partners across the country, giving them alleviation from that debt. It's also ensuring that the integrity of the scheme remains intact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we will, as a nation and, indeed, as a government, continue to recognise the importance of agriculture as a core competency of our nation. We will continue to recognise that, despite the inherent resilience of the Australian farmer, they too come up against hard times. It is incumbent on the government and the people we represent to ensure we provide access easily to those farmers. And where there is a payment that has been made, based on a very fair and genuine prediction, that creates a discrepancy, then those debts, within a very defined period of time, will be waived while the integrity of the scheme remains. With that, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

This bill addresses historic debts arising from the business income reconciliation process for farm household allowance recipients. The BIR setting was removed from the payment from 1 July 2020 in response to the independent farmer-led review of the farm household allowance. This bill will complement that decision by waiving repayment of debts arising from historic BIR cases. It will also ensure consistent and fair treatment for all FHA recipients in applying this waiver. This approach will give relief to farming families recovering from hardship, as a small but vital part of our better deal for Australian farmers. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  Labor actually supports the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. I'd like to indicate that Labor will be supporting the passage of this bill, although I also foreshadow that at the end of my remarks I'll be moving a second reading amendment. We want to be clear that the government's response to the royal commission's final report falls short of solving a number of key issues within the aged-care sector and it fails to deliver enduring improvements and reforms for the long term. This bill will make urgent amendments to the Aged Care Act to implement three measures in response to recommendation of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety and, in the case of restrictive practices, in response to the independent review of legislative provisions governing the use of restraint in residential aged care. The first key change in the legislation is around the overuse of restraints in aged care. The changes proposed in this bill will strengthen legislation on the use of restrictive practices and restraints. These changes are welcome and, as the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety identified, much needed. Restrictive practices have been a serious issue in aged care for decades. The royal commission noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The inappropriate use of unsafe and inhumane restrictive practices in residential aged care has continued, despite multiple reviews and reports highlighting the problem. It must stop now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The excessive use of physical and chemical restrains in residential aged care robs older Australians of their dignity and autonomy in their final months. It has been distressing in my own career to have seen older people tied to chairs and locked in with tables that click in around them or to have them heavily sedated overnight where they soil themselves and where these drugs exacerbate confusion. In the final three months of 2019-20 residential aged-care services made 24,681 reports of intent to restrain and 62,800 reports of physical restraint devices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make a number of important changes with regard to restrains and restrictive practices. It will clarify the definition of 'restrictive practices' in the Aged Care Act so that it is in line with the NDIS definition and ensures that all restrictive practices that limit the freedom of movement of an aged-care resident are included. It will expand the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's ability to respond to breaches of approved aged-care providers' responsibilities in relation to restrictive practices, with new abilities to issue written notices and make applications for civil penalty orders. It provides that the Quality of Care Principles set out clearly when an aged-care provider is able to consider the use of restrictive practices—importantly, only ever as a last resort. This bill should improve the regulation of restrictive practices in aged care. However, Labor notes that it falls short of the royal commission's recommendation for the introduction of independent expert approval for the use of restrictive practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second key change is the introduction of assurance reviews. This bill allows the secretary to conduct home-care assurance reviews to inform continuous improvement of home care. This is welcome if they do as described and increase the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the home-care system. It is disappointing that the government hasn't followed more closely the recommendations from the aged-care royal commission to increase transparency and accountability measures. We know there are many aged-care providers who are doing amazing work and who are dedicated to the health and wellbeing of those in their care, but we also know that there are far too many providers who are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government likes to appear tough on rogue providers, when you dive into the details of its response to the royal commission, so often it turns out that it's letting those providers do what they want. Given that there are around 928 home-care providers operating in Australia, not all providers will undergo assurance reviews. The Health Services Union noted in its submissions that the bill does not go far enough to achieve these objectives in practice and recommended that assurance reviews be carried out on a regular basis and then be published. Labor are committed to doing things differently. We want to see a transparent and accountable sector—a sector where bad providers are not allowed to run riot and do what they please, as this government has let them do for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third key change is the replacement of the Aged Care Financing Authority. The government agreed to establish an advisory group to replace the ACFA which will commence operations from July 2021 to ensure that the government continues to receive advice on financing issues in the aged-care sector. A new advisory body will be established to provide advice to the government on aged-care financing issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no urgency, however, about any of the government's response to the royal commission. This bill and its changes around the rules on the use of restraints and restrictive practices is welcome, but we must stop and ask: Why is this the only legislative action that this government is taking right now? Why is this the only bill that we're seeing months after the royal commission handed down its final report? Considering that we've just had the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which produced an eight-volume report that told us just how bad the crisis is in aged care, where is the sense of urgency to fix all of the problems identified in that report? Where is the sense of urgency to improve the level of care that older Australians are receiving? Why change the habit of a lifetime? The government has neglected aged care and older Australians for eight years. Don't just take my word for it. The royal commission perfectly described the government's approach to aged care in its final report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At times in this inquiry, it has felt like the Government's main consideration was what was the minimum commitment it could get away with, rather than what should be done to sustain the aged care system so that it is enabled to deliver high quality and safe care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is absolutely damning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has neglected older Australians in the aged-care system for eight years, and it's a national disgrace. But, despite the royal commission's damning words, it seems the government will continue to do the minimum they can get away with. The last eight years of neglect by this government have shown that another three years won't make a difference. Their response to the royal commission and the aged-care crisis falls far short of what it should have been. It fails to deliver enduring improvement and reforms for the long run. They fobbed off, delayed or outright rejected key recommendations. Their response to the aged-care royal commission claims that they've accepted, or accepted in principle, 126 of the commission's 148 recommendations, but, even when they say they've fully accepted a recommendation, it doesn't actually mean they're going to implement it in full. When you look at the detail in their response, times are pushed back—sometimes by years. Key sections of recommendations are often excluded. Sometimes they say they've accepted a recommendation and their response doesn't even pretend to match it. Now, that is a weird definition of 'accept'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the key areas of concern. Firstly, nothing will change without reforms for the workforce. There is nothing to improve wages for overstretched, undervalued aged-care workers, and, critically, there is no plan to ensure real accountability and transparency of funding. There's nothing that seriously reforms the system to see exactly where the money goes. There's no change to auditing requirements to stop money being funnelled away to Maseratis or offshore tax havens or secret family trusts while residents suffer malnutrition, lie in soiled beds and have deep, deep wounds, some of which, as we've seen, have maggots in them. They're gifting $3.2 billion to providers, with no strings attached to ensure that this goes to actual care and better food, not management bonuses or new office fit-outs. They've promised 80,000 extra home-care packages for a waitlist of 100,000 people, which is growing. The maths just doesn't add up. Australians want to age at home, but they need those packages to do it. They've ignored the recommendation to require a registered nurse to be on duty 24/7 in residential care, which we know is core to improving care. Their approach also shirks the main increase to mandatory care requirements in residential aged care. Staffing levels are central to the quality-of-care problems. Why call a royal commission and then effectively ignore most of its key recommendations? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It comes back to trust. Older Australians, their families and the workers that care for them can't trust the Prime Minister to fix this broken system. He's responsible for the aged-care system. His government is responsible for the $1.7 billion in funding cuts from when he was Treasurer. The Prime Minister hasn't learned, because his response to the aged-care royal commission is the minimum he thinks he can get away with—and not a single issue is actually fixed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we are seeing the impact of this government's neglect of aged-care residents and aged-care workers in real time in my home state of Victoria, as we emerge from our fourth lockdown, where there were cases in aged-care facilities. Last year, as we, sadly, know too well, 655 Victorians died tragically in my state in aged care. Back in February, the Prime Minister promised us that aged-care residents and workers would be vaccinated by the end of March. It's now June, and this still hasn't happened. Minister Colbeck, the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, told us that he is 'comfortable' with the pace of the vaccine rollout—comfortable. Well, I would like to tell you that the residents in aged care are not comfortable with the vaccine rollout. Many of them are fearful. No aged-care worker is comfortable with the pace of the vaccine rollout. They are fearful. The government totally gave up on trying to vaccinate the workforce. They said to the workers: 'We can't do it. It's too hard. You can go off and do it yourself and find a GP who can do it for you.' Then they actually had to survey aged-care staff to find out if they'd been vaccinated! The fact that this is happening again is an unmitigated act of total negligence by the federal government. These are people who care for our older Australians every day. They are in and out of those homes every day, and this government doesn't have a plan to vaccinate them. All of this is squarely on the federal government's shoulders. It is their responsibility, but, if you listen to them talk about it, you'd be unable to tell. Right now there is no plan, there are no targets and there is no urgency.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  All Australians deserve to age with dignity and respect. That is at the core of the reformation that is happening under this government. No-one is hiding from the fact that this has not always been the case. That's why our Prime Minister called for the royal commission into aged care as one of his first acts as Prime Minister. Some of the stories we've heard through the royal commission have been shocking. They've been really difficult to hear. But we now have to act on reformation to ensure that we improve the lives of those in the aged-care system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is committed to reforming the aged-care system, and to do this we have to respect that senior Australians need tailored, individual approaches. This Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 will deliver the first stage of the aged-care reform program in response to the royal commission. The health, safety and wellbeing of senior Australians is of the utmost importance. It is driving our plan for generational change. The Morrison government's comprehensive response to the royal commission is driven, through the lens of five broad pillars, by the principles of respect and care. Those pillars are: home care, residential aged-care quality and safety, residential aged-care services and sustainability, workforce, and governance. I will address each of those points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, senior Australians want to remain independent and in control of their life. Living at home allows them to do that and to stay connected to their community. That is why investment in home-care packages, as we are doing as a government, is so incredibly important. The government is providing $7.5 billion to ensure 80,000 new home-care packages are brought online. This is what the community wants. This is what senior Australians want. It's what we should all want. It will provide increased support for informal and family carers and support for senior Australians to find the aged-care services they need, provide increased Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission checks and provide transparency pricing to ensure value for money. The My Aged Care website and contact centre will continue to be a key entry point to help those who are ageing and their carers navigate these complex systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residential aged-care services and sustainability is the second pillar. Around 204,000 senior Australians live in residential aged care each year. The government will invest $3.9 billion over the next four years to increase frontline care, and from July 2021 there will be a new government basic daily fee supplement of $10 per resident per day, which will give immediate support for providers for the services that they provide, such as food, nutrition, linen and cleaning. There will also be a new funding model for residential aged care, which will enable transparency, and independent assessors will resolve fairer aged-care support for all residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residential aged care quality and safety is the third pillar of the reforms this government is leading. This will help strengthen the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission to further protect senior Australians. The government is investing $231 million to: enable the commission to do 1,500 more site audits; enforce regulation of physical and chemical restraint use; expand the Serious Incident Response Scheme into home care, which is being passed into law here in this House; and increase funding for the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service and the Severe Behaviour Response Teams. These are all incredibly important not only as Australia becomes an older demographic but also as we see more people developing dementia, because we are all living longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Primary care support between aged-care and healthcare systems is an incredibly important link to make. We know aged-care residential settings look to their local hospitals and their local GPs for the healthcare support they need. As Australians age better at home longer, we are seeing the residential aged-care settings have participants who are older, frailer and with more chronic diseases. As we saw last year, never has it been more important for that connection between residential aged-care settings and their local healthcare providers. The government is providing $365 million to boost the Aged Care Access Incentive and to increase GP face-to-face care. It will also provide for expansion of the Greater Choice for At Home Palliative Care pilot and better support for primary health networks and telehealth services. This is a great reform, because we know that telehealth is a great way for people to connect when they are frail and don't necessarily want to go to their GPs but GPs are busy and might not be able to get to the aged-care facility in time. These initiatives will also produce better data and evidence for workforce planning, because, as we go forward, we know there is increased demand for services and we therefore need to train people, ready for the next stage of increasing our workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads me to the third plank in these aged-care reforms—that is, the workforce. The Australian government is growing the home-care workforce by 18,000 new personal care workers, with $135 million to provide additional financial support and incentives for registered nurses. We want to incentivise nurses to enjoy caring for older Australians, and to recognise that with regard to our incentive payments. We want to grow and upskill the workforce, and increase places in the Aged Care Transition to Practice Program and the Aged Care Nursing Scholarships program. We want to fund 33,800 training places for more personal care workers to gain a Certificate III in Individual Support for ageing, and we want to give palliative-care and dementia training to workers. We know that 50 per cent of those in aged-care facilities have some form of dementia, and every worker in those workplaces needs to know how to deal with that special need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, we need to look more at governance. There is a new consumer focused aged-care act which will underpin these generational reforms. The Australian government will invest $30 million to support aged-care providers to improve their governance and meet stronger legislative obligations. There will also be a new inspector-general of aged care to provide independent oversight, and older people will have a voice through myriad ways, including the council of elders and a new aged-care advisory council. These pillars are helping to shape our response to a very important issue not just for us but also for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first steps we need to see addressed is the use of restraints in aged care. The bill before us clarifies the requirements that approved providers must meet in the use of restrictive practices. This is an important step in eliminating inappropriate use of restrictive practices, and it is through these tighter requirements that we will be able to ensure providers are providing the best care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many new powers that the Department of Health requires to ensure the safety of those in aged care, but this bill also repeals the requirement for the minister to establish the Aged Care Financing Authority, known as ACFA. It also commits to the new budgetary outline, which I have outlined before. We are investing $3.9 million, as I've said before, in the number of care minutes for residents in aged-care facilities, mandated at 200 minutes per day. That is a very important initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us is the first step in the government's five-year, five-pillar aged-care reform plan, addressing home care, residential aged-care services and sustainability, residential aged-care quality and safety, workforce and governance. We understand that the world is ageing around us. We all are going to age, because the alternative is something not worth thinking about!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Recently 42 stolen generation survivors got some closure when they settled a class action with the Commonwealth and the Catholic Church. They signed a compensation deal that was 40 years in the making for a lack of duty of care. Many of these survivors suffered appalling abuse in the Garden Point Mission on Melville Island, and many now live in my electorate. It means something to have the wrongdoings acknowledged and it goes a small way to attaining some sense of justice. I want to acknowledge all of those survivors. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of Bishop Charles Gauci, who, on behalf of the Catholic Diocese of Darwin, apologised to those who were abused at Garden Point. He said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Australia must reclaim the port of Darwin. In February of this year I delivered the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot</span> report, from the Joint Standing Committee for Trade and Investment Growth, which recommended that the government assess whether or not the port of Darwin's lease to the communist Chinese-owned Landbridge group is in the national interest. It is not in the national interest to have port infrastructure in the hands of a foreign company—particularly a company from communist China, which has recently used trade as a tool for economic coercion against this nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fighting for Australia's national interests should not be controversial. Yet we have recently heard the Leader of the Opposition describe the Australian government's efforts to shore up our nation's national security as 'inflaming nationalistic sentiment'. If it were up to Labor, we would sell every port, farm and strategic asset to the highest bidder.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only coal port in New South Wales, the port of Newcastle, is 50 per cent owned by the Chinese state owned company China Merchants. They have a monopoly on the market. They are currently fighting with the resources sector due to the astronomically high fees they charge to use their facility. These exorbitant fees are putting coal projects and Australian coalmining jobs in the Hunter Valley at risk, and it must be asked: is this part of the ongoing economic coercion we're so used to seeing by the Chinese Communist Party against Australia? Perhaps the port of Newcastle should be reclaimed alongside the port of Darwin as well.</span>

In Sanctuary Point, on the New South Wales South Coast, we have one last doctor retiring and no-one to take up the reins. The Minister for Regional Health says our area is not a distribution priority area—but the minister wouldn't know two coddles worth about my area. We have an elderly and vulnerable population and we have no public transport. In fact, the minister was so galling as to say that there are many areas of Australia that are in far greater need of GPs. What will it take?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the minister wants the GPs to leave before the government begins to do anything. That's what his office said to a local GP in 2020. They said, 'Perhaps you will become a distribution priority area again in a year or two if the number of GPs drops.' How galling, obnoxious and out of date can the minister be? Where is the workforce planning over time backed up by good federal policy to ensure we have an adequate number of GPs? It's not good enough for the government to say, 'We'll just let the numbers drop and then maybe we might change the classification.' Meanwhile, people in my electorate are screaming out for the government to just do something. They want to be able to go to their local GP. Medicare should be for everyone. Practices are hurting. Our communities are suffering. It is beyond time for the government to step up and do its job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This vessel has been delivered under the Australian government's Pacific Maritime Security Program, a $2 billion, 30-year commitment to further enhance regional cooperation.

The first was in service for the past 27 years. This new vessel has greater range and greater speed than her predecessor and will enable Kiribati to respond more effectively to both traditional and non-traditional threats. It will also provide greater security over regional fish populations on which both Australia and Kiribati rely. As fellow island nations, as regional partners, Australia and Kiribati recognise the importance of maritime security to our shared prosperity and sovereignty. I wish the crew all the very best for their journey home on this fantastic new vessel.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to call on the government to support regional Australians by properly addressing regional GP shortages. The issues facing regional health services are nothing new, but the shortage of GPs in regional areas is fast becoming a national crisis. One doctor referred to it as 'the brink of primary health collapse'. The only thing keeping GP clinics going in some of our local towns is the dedication and community spirit of doctors, nurses and staff. The pressure on these people is not healthy or fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I met with local GPs right across Eden-Monaro who told me that they were unable to deal with any succession planning as they moved towards retirement because, unfortunately, there is no one to replace them. I've had GPs email me their concerns over attracting and retaining doctors to the regions. These doctors are carrying the weight of communities on their shoulders and, if they stop practising, patients will be left with no alternative but to drive for hours for essential health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Part of the problem is the expenses and compliance requirements that make small GP clinics no longer viable. Big corporations are taking over GP clinics in the cities, but, sadly, they're not interested in rural areas. We've already seen the decline of rural GP practices, meaning there is more pressure on remaining doctors in our local hospitals. Quite simply, the system is at breaking point. We need a plan to attract and keep GPs in our regional communities. The Morrison government carries the responsibility for supporting and growing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I would like to congratulate the Kempsey Shire Council on receiving the award for outstanding employer of choice in the 2021 Macleay Valley Business Awards held last Saturday at South West Rocks Country Club. The employer of choice award recognises organisations who put in place strategies and initiatives to create stimulating and supportive workplace environments for their employees. The awards are decided by an independent panel of expert judges, recruited from outside the region. The team at Kempsey Shire Council is passionate and focused and look after their community. They have worked hard on creating a great place to live and work, and this is reflected in the way the staff are treated in their work environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This award recognises the council's HR and workplace health and safety programs over the past two years, workplace productivity, employee satisfaction for the benefits offered to staff and inclusive practices. It is the second time Kempsey Shire Council has received this award, also earning the accolade in 2019. It demonstrates their continued commitment to creating a work environment for all their staff which is positive and supportive, as well as ensuring the workplace is home to diversity and inclusivity. Kempsey Shire Council Mayor, Liz Campbell, General Manager, Craig Milburn, and all staff members should be proud of this significant achievement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  It used to be the job of my predecessor as the member for Jagajaga to come into this chamber after numerous leadership spills on the other side and ask: who is the Prime Minister? It's my job today after the Nationals leadership spill to say that we know who the new Deputy Prime Minister is. He is a man whose own female colleague this morning warned that the women of Australia would not be happy if he became leader again. He is a man who last stepped down from a leadership role after a sexual harassment allegation was made against him. He is a man who raised concerns about the provision of Gardasil, a vaccine for HPV, because of a view that it might make young women promiscuous.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told earlier this year that we had a Prime Minister for women now. We were told that those on the other side got it—that they understood that Australian women felt that they weren't being heard or seen in this place. Actions speak louder than words, and today's actions are very loud indeed. The Morrison-Joyce government does not take Australian women and their concerns seriously. In the middle of a pandemic, instead of spending their time fixing their shambles of a vaccine rollout, they spent it on a leadership spill. We deserve so much better than this. We deserve a government that genuinely listens to and respects Australian women. We deserve a government with a plan to get us out of this crisis and to get us vaccinated.</span>

I would like to offer my most sincerest congratulations to those in my electorate of Nicholls who were recognised: Ken and Cath Birkett of Mooroopna, for their services to the Goulburn Valley community; Bill Church, for his service to the Yarrawonga community; Vivian Spilva, for her service to the Yarrawonga-Mulwala community; Denis Flett, for his outstanding public service to water management in Victoria; and volunteer firefighter Lesley Read from Seymour, who received the Order of Australia service medal.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to focus a little bit on the efforts of Neale Daniher and the FightMND cause that he has championed since being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014. Neale played and coached over 300 VFL/AFL games collectively, but it is off the field where he continues to make his biggest mark. Since his diagnosis and the founding of FightMND, he has raised around $50 million, and that is going towards finding effective treatment and, ultimately, a cure for motor neurone disease. I congratulate Neale on being made an Officer of the Order of Australia, and I am in awe of his ongoing efforts to find a cure for this horrible disease.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Kunanyi/Mount Wellington is the heart and soul of Greater Hobart. Referred to by locals as 'The Mountain', it can be seen from many kilometres away and, along with the River Derwent, defines the city's very sense of place. The Organ Pipes in particular—120-metre columns of dolerite—are magnificent and are one of the most distinctive features. When sunlight hits them, the whole mountain glows. Ruining that site is just one of the reasons why the proposal to build a cable car across the Organ Pipes is such a bad proposal. The fact that it will have a significant and permanent impact on native vegetation and threatened species is another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's simply no way a 35-metre tower and a four-storey complex with restaurant, cafe and amphitheatre on top of the mountain can satisfy sensible environmental, economic and social planning criteria. Moreover, many of lutruwita/Tasmania's Aboriginal people strongly oppose the development as it will, potentially, desecrate spiritual and sacred places. This is a very important concern, and the fact that it's being paid so little attention is deeply shameful. The cable car proposal is now before Hobart City Council, and, frankly, it stinks every bit as much as the sewage that will be transported from the facility via tanks beneath the cable cars. Clearly this proposal should not be approved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Recently, I had the absolute pleasure of attending the official launch of the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair with my beautiful wife, Yolonde. The Cairns Indigenous Art Fair, or CIAF, as it's known, is Australia's premier Indigenous art fair. It celebrates the vibrancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. This year, the theme of CIAF is 'Sacred', and the artists are encouraged to discuss their sacred places, their connections to them and the significance of them, as well as the threats to their conservation. It is very exciting to be able to return to holding physical events, and, returning this year, CIAF will be held in a new home—the recently refurbished Cairns Convention Centre. CIAF injects about $8.3 million annually into the economy of my electorate and really drives home domestic visitation to tropical North Queensland. Those visiting and attending will enjoy high-end fine art, affordable art, fashion, comedy acts, music, concerts, theatre production, industry talks and symposiums and much more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2020 was hard for everybody in the events, entertainment and tourism industry, so I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate the team at CIAF, led by the chair Tom Mosby, artistic director Janina Harding, general manager Darrell Harris and the hugely talented Jack Wilkie-Jans, for their tremendous work in forging ahead with the cultural and economic opportunities for Indigenous creatives. I have no doubt at all that this year's CIAF will be the best ever. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have a complete lack, in terms of a public health campaign, and we are still using hotels for quarantine, rather than purpose-built facilities. And where has our Prime Minister been this week? The member for Cook has been on a secret cooks tour of the mother country. There he has been, doing his own SBS <span style="font-style:italic;">Who Do You Think You Are?</span> episode all by himself in the UK, while in three major cities in Australia we are fighting new outbreaks of COVID.

Clive Palmer is disrespecting locals in my community—he is—in the winter in Melbourne. Last winter, in my electorate, 472 locals contracted COVID and we lost 67 people in aged care in my community. Clive Palmer, you are disgusting. How you could put this in letterboxes in my community is beyond belief. I want to call on people who live in my electorate today: please, reject this man's rubbish and join me in demanding that this Prime Minister get us out of this COVID mess.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I rise today to congratulate a generous and courageous member of our northern beaches community. Life member of the Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving Club, a former and the longest-serving club captain, Roger Sayers was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his lifelong bravery and commitment to the surf lifesaving movement. When asked if he had done any daring rescues, Mr Sayers was more than modest, commenting that conducting a rescue may not feel incredibly difficult to him but it means a lot to the people you are helping. Mr Sayers had some advice for people swimming at the beach: they should always swim between the flags and know their limits. The ocean is a powerful force and, after lifetime of lifesaving, Mr Sayers knows it is not a force to be reckoned with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to his community service, Mr Sayers has also been a dedicated public servant who has spent more than 50 years working across several departments. Recently, Mr Sayers retired from the Treasury, where he had spent 22 years as a principal economic analyst. As we do all great economists, we need to thank Roger for his ongoing community service and his many years of dedication to our wonderful nation, both in economics and surf lifesaving. Because of you, Roger, Avalon was and remains a safe beach.</span>

Three months after the Hawkesbury saw the biggest flood in 30 years, there's limbo as we await announcements about federal-state funding agreements. Sporting clubs are still wondering if the damage will be covered by federal funds because they didn't qualify under early arrangements. The residents of Greens Road in Sackville are still waiting to hear what the plan is for their road and whether they can have some temporary arrangements via water, rather than the only route now, which is a rough dirt road requiring a half-hour detour each way. Will the bridge at Upper Colo be temporarily replaced by the Defence Force? And what is the federal support for the kilometres of eroded riverbank that will require extensive stabilisation and remediation? It has been three months and we still have so many unanswered questions from landholders, vegie growers, turf farmers and caravan park owners.</span>

It was a zero waste event. They paid their musicians. They had people like Dragon, Choir Boys, Thirsty Merc and our own locals Glenn A Baker and Imogen Clark, hosted by Ian 'Dicko' Dickson with The Duck, with the money being distributed by Rotary Australia World Community Services.

All of us who are concerned about public health and the cohesion of our communities during this pandemic of course would agree with that too. This goes for his attack on the work of the McGowan government, which is so determined to keep Western Australians safe, and his relentless, divisive and dangerous anti-vaccination campaigning, including these letters which I have here. These were distributed in my electorate, an electorate which has borne the brunt of COVID in Melbourne's northern suburbs. I say: enough is enough!</span>

I'm very pleased that headspace Toowoomba has been successful in receiving a grant of almost $1 million from this government to hire one full-time intake worker and two full-time intervention workers. It's great to see the Toowoomba region sharing in the Morrison government's $26 million investment nationwide. Over the next four years that will grow to an investment of $873 million, including $758 million for the establishment of new services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in recognition of the fact that one in four people will be affected by mental illness every year and that building resilience in our nation's youth is so important for our future. Our young people have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, placing greater stress on our support services. The issue worsens in regional and rural areas, where many young people lost work during the height of the pandemic. In Toowoomba at it's worst we saw youth unemployment creep above 25 per cent. Today, it sits at 9.7 per cent. But, while the situation has improved vastly, there is still much to do. Headspace is perfectly placed to reach this age group by offering young people access to free or low-cost support, whether for mental health, related physical health, substance misuse or social and vocational support. This funding will help headspace Toowoomba to reduce wait times to see at-risk youths sooner.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reinforces the government's strong commitment to achieve better mental health for all Australians, complementing a record investment of $6.5 million in health and suicide prevention in this year's budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  People in my community and across this country were thrown into absolute despair last week when we saw Australia become even more isolated on the national stage because of the Morrison government's attitude towards climate change and their refusal to act. During his performance at the G7 summit, the Prime Minister refused yet again to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, even though his good friend Boris Johnson, the conservative Prime Minister of England, can do it. He kind of thought Morrison had done it, but he then had to be corrected. Scott Morrison wants to use taxpayers' money to commit to a feasibility study for a new coalmine when the leading economies of the world are saying, 'Get the government out of coal.' </span>

It's wrong.</span>

At the 2019 election, as with the previous ones, the coalition took two important positions. One was that a coalition government would not fund or build a new coal-fired power station. Of course, I am technology neutral, and if it's economically competitive it doesn't need government assistance. For long-term investments, it's entirely reasonable that the government offset sovereign risk by providing mechanisms, but they must reflect all government policies with respect to affordability, reliability and emissions reduction. Secondly, consistent with our commitment under international treaties and our commitment to the Australian people at the last election, Australia will achieve net zero in the second half of this century, as the Prime Minister keeps saying. </span>

I have four-year-old children waiting four years to get grommet surgery in our public hospitals thanks to a dud state government. We've got this government cutting the bulk-billing incentive payment to my local GPs, which means my local GP surgeries are going from bulk-billing 80 per cent of their patients to 20 per cent of their patients. This is a dramatic attack on the core element of Medicare, which is bulk-billing for everyone who needs it. On top of that, their cuts to Medicare Benefits Schedule payments mean that, according to the Australian Medical Association and the Grattan Institute, you will pay more for surgeries thanks to this government's actions. We've got an attack on public hospitals by the state government, we've got attacks on bulk-billing by this government, we've got attacks on surgery by this government, and what is this government doing about it? Nothing but trying to tear down Medicare, because they've been opposed to it from day one. </span>

Those who are interjecting behind him might be having an effect on the Leader of the Opposition, but I've heard the Prime Minister answer the question specifically. We can try and get the volume turned up, but I've heard every word he has been saying.

The Deputy Prime Minister kept Australia moving. Whether it was the international freight, whether it was the national freight code agreed with state and territory transport ministers, keeping Australia moving during the COVID crisis has been essential to the wellbeing of Australians, particularly in rural and regional areas. So, for the work and leadership he's shown during that crisis, Australians will thank him for a very long time to come.</span>

I look forward to the relationship that I will renew with the member for New England in coming back into the cabinet and serving as Deputy Prime Minister, because we've got a lot to do. There's a lot of work to be done. There's a lot of support that we need to continue to provide to rural and regional Australians. The Nationals is a party that is grounded in rural and regional Australia, and works with the Liberals in rural and regional areas as well, to ensure that we understand the challenges faced by regions. In those regions, the heavy industries, the agricultural sector, the trade deals that they require, the infrastructure that supports their way of life—this is what our government champions. We understand the challenges of rural and regional Australia, and the coalition between the Liberals and the Nationals is what enables us, I think, to be such a strong government for supporting rural and regional Australians. I congratulate the member for New England on his election as Nationals leader, and my heartfelt thanks go to the Deputy Prime Minister for being such a tremendous bloke.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  [by video link] I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. He understands, like so many in this place and in the chamber, that Australians' safety, security and prosperity depend on our working together with our like-minded partners and allies both within our region and further afield. The recent G7-plus dialogue, or D11 as Prime Minister Johnson referred to it, provided another significant opportunity for Australia to be round the table when there couldn't have been a more important time to be round that table, dealing with the challenges of COVID, the recession that it has caused, the strategic issues that present in the Indo-Pacific. All of these are some of issues that need to be addressed globally as well as regionally and, indeed, by Australia. In those meetings we were able to work together to address the COVID response globally. Australia committed another 20 million doses as part of the G7 initiative to support the work of like-minded countries around the world, assisting developing countries. We worked together on technology solutions to address the new energy economy. Practical hydrogen partnerships were secured with Japan, with Germany and with Singapore, which was secured on the way to the G7. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We worked together to open up new trade opportunities, with an in-principle agreement on the new free trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which will see beef exports go from 3.5 kilotonnes of beef per year to 35,000 tonnes, or 35 kilotonnes, a year in just about 12 months time. These are big changes that are going to open up new markets and opportunities for Australian producers as well as opening up our service economies to support both of our growing economies. It was also about ensuring we work together to make sure that the rules of international trade work. Australia is a trading nation and the rules of law, as they apply to international trade, are vital. There were important breakthroughs in improving the work of the World Trade Organization and particularly its appellate structures, which have been dysfunctional for some time. We need those structures to be put back in place, and there was strong agreement on the need to progress those issues, which is in Australia's interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We worked together also on deepening our defence and security partnerships. This has been highlighted most recently by the joint exercises between France and Australia with the LHD <span style="font-style:italic;">Tonnerre</span> and the frigate <span style="font-style:italic;">Surcouf</span> travelling through the South China Sea together with HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Anzac</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sirius</span>. This will be followed up by the UK carrier group, with HMS <span style="font-style:italic;">Queen Elizabeth</span> joined by the German frigate <span style="font-style:italic;">Bayern</span>. This partnership, together with the broader defence deepening of technology partnerships with the United Kingdom and the United States, will work to ensure Australia's security both in the region and more globally. Finally, we're working together to strengthen the multilateral system in which we play a part, particularly the OECD, where I had the good opportunity to meet with the new Australian Secretary-General. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The Nationals took a decision today to have a party room vote, as is the convention of any political party. The opposition leader mentions the leadership changes in the Liberal-National government. I think Australians can well remember what went on in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. They were dysfunctional, they were chaotic and they were not good for this nation. Indeed, we have worked very hard as a government to repay the debt left to us as a legacy of those Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. Just prior to the pandemic hitting, we were so close to getting back in the black. Indeed, we would have got back in the black but for the global pandemic. If it has escaped the attention of the opposition leader and those behind him, we are in the middle of a global pandemic. We are addressing that very excruciating issue for and on behalf of Australians. We have, since 2013, been a very, very good government. There are more people in employment now than there were when we got back into government in 2013. The unemployment rate, at 5.1 per cent, as determined just last week, is lower than it was prior to the pandemic. That is something that we should be proud of. We have not lost our AAA credit rating. We have more Australians in work, and more women in work. They are participating in the workforce. That is a good thing, and I'm sure that the women of the Labor Party agree that that is a good thing. We will go on being a good government. Under the Prime Minister, under the member for New England, we will go on being a good government, serving Australians as you would expect us to do, and as Australians would expect us to do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a bit of a tough day for me, but I've still got a job. There are many Australians out there who are doing it far tougher. There are many Australians today who are in hospital wards recovering from COVID, and my thoughts are with them. My thoughts are not about me. This isn't about me; this is about Australians. We will go on serving Australians. We will go on serving those Australians who have got mice ravaging their farms. We will go on serving small-business owners who are concerned about whether they will have a future. Rest assured, under the Liberals and Nationals, the economic future will be far brighter than it would ever be under an Albanese-led government. It will be far better than it was during those six sorry, chaotic, divided, dysfunctional years under Rudd, Gillard and Rudd.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:11</span>):  I have some numbers to read to the House. Numbers have not been my friend today, but these numbers are. These numbers are very enlightening. The member for Mallee's electorate has had $73.5 million go to the 12 councils in her electorate. That is the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program funding that we are delivering for that proud Victorian regional electorate. I'm proud of those numbers, and I'm very, very proud that the budget, handed down on 11 May, by the Treasurer, made sure that there was an additional $1 billion on top of the $1½ billion we allocated last year, for the LRCI Program. That is a good program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I was in the member for Capricornia's electorate, talking to the Livingstone shire mayor, Andy Ireland. I was looking at the road programs there, looking at the aquatic centre in Yeppoon. These are community infrastructure projects that would not have been made possible but for the Liberals and Nationals making sure that we support regional communities, making sure, as the minister for local government often reminds me, we support all councils. There are 537 of them right across this nation, and I'm proud to say that we have delivered for those local government areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I addressed the Australian Local Government Association conference this morning. There they were, in the National Convention Centre, the mayors—many of whom will be up for re-election this September in New South Wales. They are doing it proud for their communities. I commend local government for what it has done, and I am also mindful of the investment that this government has placed in those local councils' futures, in the people who are in those regional communities, making sure that we have backed them to be their best selves. Whether it's West Torrens with a lighting project at a community oval, whether it's Gympie fixing a footpath that is broken, we are making sure that we get that money out the door.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly important in this time of COVID, where so many people are concerned about their future. So many people were worried about whether they would have a job. The Treasurer has made sure that we have got very good employment numbers indeed. I commend the Treasurer for the work that he has done. I commend the government for what we have done to support those regional economies, particularly those remote economies. I'm so pleased and proud of the assistance that we have provided the aviation sector. The Prime Minister mentioned keeping the wheels turning. Indeed, we have; but we've also kept planes in the air. We know that planes in the air mean jobs on the ground. I particularly liked the flight attendant's words as I alighted from a flight to Roma the other day. She said, 'Thanks to you, I'm still in a job,' and that is the most important thing that we, as parliamentarians, can do—keep people in jobs and give them prospects for the future.</span>

What an amazing organisation; it's the Flynn of the outback, making sure the angels of mercy get to those remote communities and get the vaccinations to those people, who expect nothing less.

That's what we've done, that's what Australians would expect us to do and that's why we've been able to keep Australians safe.

The Tasmanian government is stuffing up the Hobart City Deal by failing to decide how to spend the $25 million federal funding for the Northern Suburbs Transit Corridor and by its bizarre decision to spend $35 million of state funding on a fifth lane to the Southern Outlet. The Southern Outlet plan is especially unfathomable, as all it will do is see many homes demolished and more vehicles squeezed into the already gridlocked Macquarie and Davey streets. The city deal is a working partnership between all levels of government, but the Tasmanian government is clearly out of its depth. So I ask: please, Minister, will you intervene and help sort it out? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:20</span>):  I thank the member for Clark for his question. I acknowledge his advocacy and his interest in the Hobart City Deal. Indeed, there is $30 million for social housing, for which he has been an important advocate; some 100 new social and affordable homes will be delivered. Quite a few have already been delivered; I had the privilege of visiting one of those homes and speaking with the tenant a few weeks ago, and she was very positive about what this has meant for her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I assure the member and the House that the $1.7 billion Hobart City Deal is in good shape. It will support over 1,400 jobs. There is a positive partnership between all three levels of government, as the member has rightly acknowledged that there should be. I had the chance in March this year to attend a Hobart City Deal Joint Ministerial Committee meeting, together with: the responsible state minister, the Hon. Michael Ferguson; the Acting Lord Mayor of Hobart, Helen Burnet, the mayor of Glenorchy; the mayor of Kingborough; and the acting mayor of Clarence. It was a very productive meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we are delivering outcomes under the Hobart City Deal. One of the commitments was an international gateway to support direct international flights. I was very pleased to be there with Premier Gutwein to welcome the first flight by Air New Zealand coming into Hobart. International flights at Hobart Airport—a commitment delivered. We are working with the city deal partners on the Northern Suburbs Transit Corridor. There is a commitment of $25 million. We're considering the findings of a study of potential transport solutions. Indeed, on 25 May the Northern Suburbs Transit Corridor Working Group agreed to commission a conditions report, and we are awaiting the outcomes of that report. The city deal will deliver the $76 million fifth transit lane on the Southern Outlet, with extra lane capacity to be added to the Southern Outlet, and many other transport projects and other projects, including the Bridgewater Bridge. I want to acknowledge the passion and commitment of the Deputy Prime Minister and the work he has put into delivering the Bridgewater Bridge. It has been a privilege to work with the Deputy Prime Minister on that and many other projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many other projects are also forming part of the city deal or sitting alongside the city deal and complementing it, including our joint funding with the Gutwein government of the $46.4 million Hobart Airport Interchange. We are spending $130 million on the south-east traffic package to help maintain the livability of Sorell and the Southern Beaches by improving travel time reliability. We have seen a very important announcement from the University of Tasmania about relocating its campus from Sandy Bay to Central Hobart by 2030. Certainly all governments understand the importance of that for the regeneration and for the transport networks that will be needed to support that. The city deal is delivering for the people of Hobart, with all three levels of government working together. I thank the member for his continuing interest in it.</span>

I had the great opportunity to join the honourable member in his electorate recently, in Cammeray, for a community forum to discuss the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression, the Australian economy is recovering strongly. Unemployment is down, growth is up and our economy has outperformed nearly every other major economy around the world. Indeed, the Australian economy today is larger than it was going into the pandemic. Because of the policies of the Morrison government, there are more people in work today than there were before the pandemic began. We saw, in the March quarter national accounts, farmer output, off the back of a strong winter crop, at its highest level in seven years. We saw dwelling investment, off the back of the HomeBuilder program, at its strongest level in 17 years. Our immediate expensing provisions, allowing businesses to go and buy machinery and equipment, saw purchases and investment in machinery and equipment over recent quarters at its strongest level in 18 years. If you take the last three-quarters of economic growth, this is the strongest growth that Australia has seen in more than 50 years. This is a sign that our economic plan is working.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked whether there are any alternative approaches. We know that those opposite not only want to tax more with their $387 billion of higher taxes but they also want to spend more, because they wanted the JobKeeper program to keep going. The member for Rankin said: 'Cutting JobKeeper today will have diabolical consequences.' The Leader of the Opposition, the economic novice over there, said JobKeeper was the 'only support that was keeping the economic roof from crashing down'. The Leader of the Opposition also said that 'ending JobKeeper would have a devastating impact on the economy'. Well, the news for the Leader of the Opposition is that, since the end of JobKeeper, unemployment has come down; 84,000 new jobs have been created since the end of JobKeeper; and nearly one million new jobs have been created since the pandemic began last year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House stand for lower taxes and we're delivering lower taxes. We stand for more jobs and we're delivering more jobs. Only the Leader of the Opposition is a threat to the strong national economic recovery.</span>

The Deputy Prime Minister, in his capacity as regional development minister, has commented continuously, including just in his last answer, on quarantine, on the vaccine and on the issue of the pandemic. He is the Deputy Prime Minister. You just declared correctly that that's the case, and he should have the capacity to answer the question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The Leader of the Opposition has made his case. The Deputy Prime Minister is responsible still as Deputy Prime Minister and for his respective portfolios. The fact that, in his ministerial capacity, he has been referring to quarantine, even recently, means that I'll allow the question. But I obviously just caution that questions can only be asked of the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as a minister because he's no longer acting Prime Minister. The Prime Minister of course is with us remotely. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.</span>

There have been none community transmitted in Australia. We mourn for those 910 Australians who have lost their lives. We will go on remembering them and we will go on mourning them, and their families are certainly heartbroken by their loss. But we should be very proud of what we have been able to do as a nation to keep coronavirus case rates very low and the death toll very, very low.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in place a quarantine system, using hotels and motels. That was established through the national cabinet process, and, last time I looked, there were more Labor premiers sitting around that meeting than there were Liberals. We've taken the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. We've taken the advice of Professor Paul Kelly, Australian Chief Medical Officer. We've taken advice from the previous CMO, Dr Brendan Murphy, who is now the secretary of the health department. We've taken advice of chief health officers throughout the states and territories and that has kept us safe. We've said to state premiers and chief ministers—both of them—that if they can come forward with proposals we will certainly look at it through the national cabinet process, through the Prime Minister, as you would expect, as Australians would expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are criteria around that. The criteria include: proximity to a tertiary hospital, proximity to an airport with regular international flights, making sure that the communities in and around those quarantine facilities are in favour of a quarantine facility being built in their locality. We've taken that advice on board. We've done the right thing all the way through. We have a good submission from Victoria and that's being considered in the proper way, as Australians would expect. If other states come forward with proposals that stack up we'll certainly look at those too.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've assisted with the enlargement and expansion of the Howard Springs facility in the Northern Territory by an additional $500 million. We will make sure that that facility continues to be fit for purpose to take returning Australians home. But the critical thing is keeping Australians safe. I know that Australians out there would be very pleased about how we've adopted this approach, taken the best possible medical advice and kept this nation safe.</span>

I'm pleased to advise the House that young people especially are continuing to find work with the help of the Morrison government's plan for our economic recovery. Our plan, as we outline in the federal budget, is pretty straightforward. It's about protecting current jobs, connecting people with vacant jobs and, of course, skilling up our workforce for tomorrow's jobs. The plan is working. As the Treasurer said, unemployment is down 5.1 per cent. There were over 115,000 more Australians in work last month, and a lot of those continue to be those working in the apprenticeship field, indeed, boosting apprenticeship commencements. The BAC program is securing a record 300,000 tradies right across the country. The great thing about the current labour force figures is that they show that 8½ thousand young Australians gained employment last month. There are now 1.91 million young Australians in work. We are outperforming our peers in the OECD when it comes to youth unemployment—in fact, 3.3 per cent lower in comparison to others in the OECD. The recent data shows that our youth unemployment is one per cent lower than March 2020 and two per cent lower than when the coalition came to government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're great numbers but we all know that there's still a lot more to do. There are still 100,000 Australians receiving youth allowance (other), which means that they're not working or not in training. However, as we updated the House last week, we've seen the highest number of job adverts in 12 years, which means there's enormous opportunity for Australians right now to continue to get skilled. We're backing them in and we're backing the businesses in who are also working with them—like Baker and Provan, a company operating since 1946. The member for Lindsay and I went and visited them recently. It's one of those great manufacturing companies that makes stuff that we in Australia need. It makes things. It builds things. It was started by two returned diggers from World War II. They've trained over 70 apprentices and they've got six apprentices right now, like Jane, a first-year fitter we met, and Brad and Cameron, in their second and third years. They're manufacturing stuff for some of Australia's biggest projects, from trains to cranes, from tunnel borers to armoured vehicles and fast rescue boats. These are things that Australia wants—strong manufacturers that are employing Australians. They're family owned, they're Australian owned, they're a success story building things right in our backyard, and this government, this side of the House, is backing them in, backing small business in and backing Australians looking for a job in.</span>

Australia's unique plants, animals, landscapes and places are central to our nation's identity and quality of life, and they're recognised the world over. Likewise, our economic activity is dependent on the services and benefits provided by nature. Industries like agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and manufacturing all depend on a healthy environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, I tabled in this parliament the Samuel review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Professor Samuel found a comprehensive reworking of the legislation is required, with reform best delivered in stages. Consistent with this view, last week I released the government's reform time line and pathway document. This document sets out a clear and detailed road map for reform, informed by Professor Samuel's recommendations and developed through consultation—a consultation I'm committed to continuing. Our pathway provides stakeholders with clarity and certainty. Let's be clear: these reforms represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve environmental outcomes and simultaneously facilitate economic development, but the reality is that the EPBC Act is complex, and meaningful reform can only be achieved by adopting this staged and pragmatic approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Business Council of Australia said recently, the government—the parliament—has two choices. It can continue to allow a muddled and confused system that is not helping the environment or the economy or it can take the first step to improve the environment and create more jobs in regional Australia. The state premiers and chief ministers at national cabinet are in agreement, and they've set out three clear steps: a commitment to implement single-touch environmental approvals, the development of a first set of national environmental standards, and subsequent phases of reform to build on these streamlining efforts. Make no mistake: if we don't get the process moving, it will end up hurting both the economy and the environment. But this is a challenge that the Morrison government will not shy away from, and I hope Labor joins us on this journey. Those opposite can work with the government to support the bills that are currently before the parliament or they can let, in the words of the BCA, 'this muddled and confused system' live on, stifling growth and not helping our environment. If the parliament doesn't support these bills, the occasion for real reform, focused on Graeme Samuel's key themes of accreditation, harmonisation and standards, will be lost and so too will the opportunity to provide better outcomes for our unique environment for generations to come.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. We will always make sure that our policies—our climate policy and any other policy—will be in the best interests of jobs in this nation. Regional Australia is leading the way when it comes to taking responsible action on climate—absolutely it is. There is the fact that we've got so many solar farms; they're in regional Australia. Wind farms, whether you like them or not, are in regional Australia. Indeed, our agriculture industry—our farming sector—remains committed to making sure that it will play a leading role in lowering emissions into the future. Many farmers are committed to that very task right now. They're doing all the sorts of things that you would expect them to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember that, when my late father, Lance, was a farmer, we would burn our stubble. These days, they're ploughing it back into the soil to provide those vital nutrients and nitrogen back to the soil. We're changing our farming practices for the better. We're improving our farming practices and we're also utilising technology. I'm proud that I sit on the side of government, that I sit on the side of this House that has invested considerably in GPS technology, which would have meant that my father wouldn't have had to rely on me going all over the paddock when I was driving the tractor—just probably to get out of the job. These days they steer themselves, and well done to the government for providing that vital assistance with funding for GPS technology and other technologies. I'll tell you what we'll do as a government to lead the way in making sure that we continue to lower our emissions: we'll do it through technology, not taxes. Taxes are the Labor way. They're the Greens way. We'll do it through technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I'm proud to say that we're not only meeting but beating all of the international obligations we said we would meet. There are other countries clamouring at the moment to say a lot of things about climate, but we're beating them as well. We are beating the lower emissions that they are putting in place as well. We're 20 per cent lower since 2005. That's what we're doing, and we should be proud. We should be standing on the rooftops, next to our solar panels, saying, 'What a good job Australia is doing at lowering emissions.' And we will continue to do that. We'll do it through technology, not taxes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:55</span>):  I want to thank the member for Higgins for her work both as a clinician and as a National Health and Medical Research Council ranked and recognised researcher over her career. One important thing that we have seen is all of the elements of the Australian health system coming together to protect Australians during the course of the pandemic. As my friend the Deputy Prime Minister said very clearly, in a world where two million lives were lost to COVID this year, there have been no Australians who have caught COVID in this country and passed from COVID this year. That juxtaposition is almost unimaginable, and yet that is what Australia has achieved. It's achieved it through all of the actions that have been taken together by the Australian government, the states and territories and, in particular, the Australian people, the health and medical research sector and health and medical workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support for that has included over $2 billion to the aged-care sector for its work to help protect Australians through COVID and over $6 billion to the Medicare sector, including support for more than 60 million telehealth consultations—the largest, most positive change in Medicare since Medicare was created, a fundamental transformation of that system undertaken to deal with COVID but embedded for future generations. In addition to that, our support includes over $7.2 billion for the vaccine rollout and, furthermore, $9 billion for the hospital system and PPE. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the vaccine rollout, we've now hit 6.5 million doses that have been delivered in Australia. That includes the fact that in the last three days we've had 230,000 doses delivered. Over the equivalent period a week ago, on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there were 226,300 doses. So, interestingly, over these last three days since the ATAGI announcement we've seen an increase of almost 4,000 doses from the comparable period a week before. At the same time, 26.7 per cent of Australians, 48 per cent of those over 50 and, very importantly, 65 per cent of those over 70 years of age have had vaccinations. And we continue this program. Each day, every day, we're seeing more Australians vaccinated, we're seeing lives protected and we're seeing a result. In a world of two million lives lost this year alone, that has been translated to an Australian outcome of no person having lost their life to COVID caught in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We beat our Kyoto-era targets by 459 million tonnes. Our emissions are down more than 20 per cent from 2005 to December last year, compared to an OECD average of 6.6 per cent from 2005 to 2018. We should be proud of doing what we're doing and having achieved what we've achieved as far as climate action—responsible climate action—is concerned. But we will not, as Liberals and as Nationals, put in place policies that are going to jeopardise the jobs and livelihoods of Australians who depend on it. Indeed, we have put in place a manufacturing policy which is funding, which is investing in, which is backing and which is supporting those people who want an industry base, who need a job in our manufacturing sectors. Those manufacturing sectors have a high energy need, a great power input requirement, and we will back every step of the way the climate policies that not only back and support those jobs but, at the same time, keep household energy and electricity prices low.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, Australia has one of the highest rates of per capita investment in renewable energy technologies in the world. That might have escaped the attention of those opposite, but indeed we have. The Clean Energy Regulator estimates that a record seven gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity was installed in 2020. That was at a time, of course, when there was so much happening in this nation—recovery from bushfires, recovery from drought, a global pandemic—yet, despite that, we were putting in place policies that promoted renewable energy. We were putting in place policies that continued the investment by regional Australia. I mentioned farmers in my last answer, and farmers indeed stand ready to help deliver the assurance and insurance that Australia needs, as far as lowering our emissions even further is concerned. They are going to be one of the biggest inputs into making sure that we continue to lower emissions, and we will do that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in my previous answer that we have the world's highest uptake of rooftop solar. One in four households has rooftop solar panels. That's thanks to the policies and commitments we've made as Liberals and Nationals, and we'll go on doing it for the benefit of future generations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  I thank the member for his question and his passion for free trade. He's pursued free trade policies ever since he came to this place, and I thank him for his commitment to the importance of trade to this country. Not only were we able to deliver for our ricegrowers, our canegrowers, our dairy farmers, our beef producers and our lamb producers but also, in this free trade agreement, we were able to make sure that we got broad coverage right across our economy through the Australia-UK free trade agreement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK is our second-biggest source of foreign investment, worth $737 billion in 2020, while the UK is the second-biggest destination of Australian investment, worth $615 billion in 2020. When it comes to two-way services trade, it's worth $9.9 billion in 2020, and our professional services accounted for $769 million—that is 13.6 per cent of our total services trade. So what we were able to deliver in the Australia-UK free trade agreement was an ability to underpin our already strong investment relationship, including: commitments covering all investment, portfolio and FDI; to establish a best-practice framework to improve two-way movement of professionals, including provisions to support mutual recognition of professional qualifications and a specific work program between legal peak bodies to ease access for lawyers; and provisions on temporary entry to support economic recovery, enhance opportunities for business travel and encourage people to travel and work in each other's countries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were able to support our vibrant creative sectors, including through high-standard provisions on copyright, designs and the enforcement of intellectual property rights online. We were also able to expand reciprocity arrangements for artists' resale rights, to amplify the economic benefits to Australian artists who market their works overseas. The highest proportion of eligible resales in the Australian scheme occurs among Indigenous art wholesalers. All this will create more jobs in our country. One in five jobs already is created by trade, one in four, as the Deputy Prime Minister knows, in regional Australia. That's why the Ai Group's CEO, Innes Willox, said:</span>

It goes to the ruling today with respect to coalition agreements. I refer to page 554 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, where it goes through the different lists of questions that have ordinarily been ruled out of order and cites, as an example of arrangements between parties, 'coalition agreements on ministerial appointments'. Up until today, certainly as far as <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> would indicate, those agreements have not been barred to the extent that they go to policy. If we end up in the situation for the rest of the week or, indeed, the term where a key reason for a major policy of international concern with respect to net zero by 2050 can't be asked about, that would in fact be, on the face of it, quite a new precedent, because the question from the Leader of the Opposition today didn't go in any way to the ministerial appointments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I simply raise that now because I think this is inevitably going to come up. If the intention today was to make a new ruling, then it was to make a new ruling. If it was simply to reflect on what was already in <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, then I would not want to see a situation where the House was held back from being able to ask about a major policy topic of national and international concern.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I'll make a couple of quick points. Certainly it's not the case that ministers can't also be questioned about policies for which they're responsible to the House. It's really the manner in which the question is asked. I point out to the Manager of Opposition Business that, certainly, on page 554 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> it does say, as he said, 'arrangements between parties'. It does mention 'coalition agreements on ministerial appointments', but before that it says 'for example'. So I will certainly reflect on the issue and reflect on some previous rulings, including those that are cited in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>. I think that in 1978 and 2006, certainly, the matter came up several days in a row. My recollection is I've allowed some but knocked back others. I think, probably, the complicating factors today were the ministerial issues for which the Deputy Prime Minister remains responsible and the Leader of the Opposition certainly doing his best by referring to the previous answer. But, obviously, I'll examine that issue. I'm always reflecting on these sorts of matters.</span>

I have a 96-year-old hard-of-hearing woman who is legally blind—a widow in Ipswich—who can't get an ACAT assessment. I had a 91-year-old man who was eligible for a level 3 home-care package and eventually got it. He then became eligible for a level 4 package, but died waiting for that package. I have a 92-year-old stroke survivor and widow who languishes on a level 2 package, and has done so for two years while waiting for a level 3 package. These are just three of the stories, from my electorate, of a system that's failing. I speak today to the amendment moved by the shadow assistant minister, the member for Cooper. The system that we have in aged care in this country is abysmal. It's cruel. It's unfair to frail, older citizens in this country and it's inadequate. The government's response to the royal commission is a squandered opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation that we have before the House today, the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, deals with three issues only in relation to that royal commission, which handed down an interim report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect </span>and a detailed report providing a pathway forward, which the government has not taken up. These amendments that are before the House are to strengthen legislation on the use of restrictive practices—which were commented upon and condemned heartily and wholly by the royal commission. Again and again they found the excessive use of restrictive practices. There is some alignment here with the Aged Care Act and the definition under the NDIS that's necessary. There's also an expansion of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission's ability to respond to breaches of approved aged-care providers responsibilities in relation to restrictive practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women massively outnumber men in residential aged care by almost two to one. Close to two-thirds of the people living in residential aged care—up from just 50 per cent a few years ago—are living with dementia. Indeed, dementia is the biggest killer of women and the second-biggest killer of men, yet this government has failed in relation to aged care and dementia. They've had a consistent minister for aged care but not a minister for ageing. There is nothing about an age-friendly Australia or dementia-friendly communities across this country that this government has taken up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission, that's the subject of this bill, found extraordinary themes: neglect, maggots in the wounds of residents, about two-thirds of residents being malnourished or at risk of being malnourished. This government has been warned by report after report after report. But the government has done almost nothing in respect of workforce development. Indeed, you'd have thought they'd have had a workforce strategy across eight years of being in government. But I pay tribute to those people who are dealing with the Commonwealth Home Support Program; Home Care Packages; Meals on Wheels; those men and women working as nurses, enrolled or registered; and the personal carers, administrators and financiers. These are the people, in both the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, who are working hard to care for older Australians, so many of whom are incapable of caring for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its infinite wisdom, this government has decided to give about $3.2 billion, with no strings attached, to residential aged-care providers. There are no linkages in terms of better nourishment, better care, better accountability or better transparency. This is simply ignoring recommendations of the royal commission. Where is the requirement by this government to clear Home Care Packages? We have tens of thousands of Australians who have died while waiting for Home Care Packages, and I mentioned a constituent of mine before. We've had tens of thousands people going into residential aged care prematurely because they can't get Home Care Packages. There are 100,000 Home Care Packages needed, and this government has failed to deliver them. What about the recommendations ensuring that we have nurses on duty in residential aged care 24/7? There is nothing from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think it's important to know that the substandard care we're seeing now is not a recent phenomenon—not by any means. When it came to the election in 2013, we saw that the government had seven pages in their aged-care policy. Does anyone remember that blue book they used to hang onto all the time in the 2013 election? It only had seven pages on aged care—that's what they had. They must have realised, surely, that more than 80 per cent of the funding for aged care in this country comes from the federal government, and that 100 per cent of the responsibility for quality and safeguards in the system is the federal government's. Whether it's in vaccine rollout, quarantine, the NBN, the NDIS or robodebt, aged care is up there on the podium of failure for this government. I'm not sure whether it gets the bronze, the silver or the gold medal, but it's really up there on the podium. According to the latest population trends, 38 per cent of Australian men and 55 per cent of Australian women end up in permanent residential aged care, and their average stay is about two to three years. This means that so many of our fellow citizens, including many people in this chamber who were here in question time, will go into residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government has failed. We only have to read the 12-page foreword of <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span> to get a sense of the rage, heartbreak and failure in the aged-care system in this country. Let's look back at the history of the failure of this government. We have a government which came to power in November 2013. What did they do? They scrapped the Advisory Panel on Positive Ageing—they scrapped it straightaway. What did they do then? They decided that they would get rid of the $1.2 billion that was designed to help workforce development. They haven't got a workforce strategy at all. There was an aged-care workforce supplement given to providers, with strings attached, to make sure that there was training, development and growth in the aged-care workforce. We need to treble the aged-care workforce by 2050. So what did this government do? They got rid of the supplement—they canned the $1.2 billion. Then, a few months later, in June 2014, they axed the dementia supplement. That was just fantastic, getting rid of the dementia supplement—and the veterans supplement, I might add—that was being provided to help people who were living in need to be cared for. It was there because the Aged Care Funding Instrument, or ACFI, doesn't cover severe behavioural issues and issues for people who are suffering from dementia. It doesn't cover those, but the government decided to cut that funding. Again and again we've barely seen a budget or MYEFO where this particular government hasn't decided to cut funding for residential aged care or home care. Even when they said they were going to provide assistance, it was usually a sleight of hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give a couple of instances of why we're where we are today. Think about this. In September 2017, they decided they were going to provide 6,000 home-care packages. That was in response to the first release of the Home Care Packages data. It was because it was a political problem, and they had to try to do something. The HCPs were a result of a change in the ratio, and they were fully exhausted by December 2017. They announced it in September, and it was fully exhausted by December 2017. There was no new funding at all. In the 2017-18 budget, they decided that they would create 14,000 new home-care packages. It was entirely funded by a reduction in more than 26,000 projected residential aged-care places from 2017-18 to 2020-21. There was no new funding. They took money from residential aged care and put it into home-care packages and then patted themselves on the back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the MYEFO, in 2018, just a few years ago, they decided they would provide another 10,000 packages. What they really did was not provide any new funding; they just brought forward funding they'd previously allocated in the budget—$287.3 million. They brought it forward by one year and they released 5,000 level 3 packages and 5,000 level 4 packages. There was no new money. They just brought it forward a year. In February 2019, they announced another 10,000 packages on the eve of the beginning of the hearings of the royal commission into aged care. Just before the hearings started they decided, 'We'd better do something to show we're doing something,' so they announced $282.4 million over five years for the next level 4 packages. There was effectively no new money, and it was actually re-announced in the budget in May. They announced it once, and they announced it again. Then, in November 2019, they announced another 10,000 home-care packages. They were announced prior to MYEFO in response to the royal commission recommendations from 1 December. There were 5,500 in the first year. But it was almost impossible to know, when you looked at it, where they got the money from and whether it was or wasn't new money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there were a number of years when this government shuffled money around from residential care to home-care packages, when they provided no new money at all, but they wanted to pat themselves on the back and say: 'We've done a good job. We're responding.' But it was always in response to a political problem, whether it was the release of home-care data, a hearing that was coming up, or a royal commission that was about to commence. This is simply not good enough. You can barely find a budget or a MYEFO where they didn't cut funding. An amount $1.7 billion was cut when this Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister of Australia, was Treasurer. They kept cutting and shuffling money everywhere, and then they wonder why a royal commission found there's neglect, no workforce strategy, people living in terrible conditions, one in three people malnourished and substandard care. They wonder why we've got a problem. How about you actually fund the system properly? Where's the $10 billion per annum that's required, as was submitted to the royal commission? Where's that? Where's that in the budget? They give a bit of money, no strings attached, ignore the requirement that you have to have transparency and better supervision, and then think they've solved the problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care is in crisis in this country. We need to treble the workforce. We need to deal with the idea that it's not an aged-care issue; it's an ageing issue. We should be proud of longevity in this country, but we should deal with the challenges that come with aged care and with longevity. The median time for older Australians waiting to get into residential aged care has grown by more than 100 days under the Liberals and Nationals. It's gone from a month to about five months. This government is not serious about this issue. They find a supplement anywhere, whether it's a dementia supplement, a veterans supplement or a workforce supplement, and they get rid of it—and then they wonder why there are consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular legislation that we have before the chamber today deals with just three issues—three issues only. They need to do much, much better. You can't say you're going to deal with the challenges of ageing if you don't improve quality and safety. You can't say you're going to improve transparency if you have no strings attached to funding. It's a bit like when Campbell Newman came to power in my home state of Queensland; they rolled out money—and this government did the same thing—on education without any transparency or accountability. You've got a $3.2 billion budget allocation to supplement the basic daily fee by $10 per day per resident. The royal commission recommended that; yes, that's true—that there should be an increase in the daily fee. But there are no strict reporting requirements, and the government didn't follow it as required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do things differently in this country. We need to make sure that aged-care providers can do what they need to do. We need to make sure that residents, whether in residential aged care or living in community and getting home-care packages, or just getting meals on wheels, are funded properly, that the services are funded properly and are accountable. The government need to do much, much better than they're doing currently with respect to aged care and ageing, and they should hang their heads in shame if they can't do better.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. On 24 July 2019 I stood in this place and, in my maiden speech, said that my father, a country doctor:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… despaired at times at man's inhumanity to man, particularly the aged, who he believed should be treated with dignity in their final years, not discarded as a burden on society. In this regard, he was right … the aged-care system is bowing under the weight of demand, and residents are all too often treated as a number on a ledger to be measured in profit and loss. The need for a royal commission only validates his decades-old fear. I am pleased, however, that this government has taken steps in recent times to address aged care with record funding. However, more needs to be done. With 27 per cent of residents over 65 in Port Macquarie alone, with similar figures throughout Cowper, we must prepare now for their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, two years on, it is imperative that we as the government look to continue to make change within the aged-care industry for the best interests of the residents, their families, the staff and the future of our ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands that the royal commission into aged care is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to confront the inadequacies within aged care whilst bringing real change to the system. I am pleased to say that this government has responded to the challenge and is providing a first set of responses that can help meet the future needs of our residents. As a nation we must look to improve our level of respect for our senior Australians, and it must be a national priority. From this respect comes all that we value in the care of our ageing loved ones—dignity, safety and wellbeing. We should all strive to ensure the oldest and the most vulnerable within our society receive the levels of care that support and respect that dignity. We must recognise the contribution our older residents have made to the foundations of our society, and this must be reflected in our care and understanding of their needs in their later years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 148 recommendations from the royal commission into aged care. This government understood this royal commission as a call to action, a call for fundamental and ambitious reform. So this bill and the government's response to the royal commission is an acknowledgement that we will embrace this generational change and provide the necessary framework for the industry into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2021 federal budget is another example of how this government is responding to that final report of the royal commission. The proposed $17.7 billion aged-care reform package is designed to deliver sustainable quality and safety in home and residential aged-care services. These proposed changes in this bill will continue this government's ambitious drive to protect our older residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen on our TV screens and heard on the radio in recent times that there have been a number of terrible incidents where residents in aged-care facilities have been mistreated. This bill provides the necessary framework and changes to protect aged-care residents into the future. This has been achieved through the use of, and the definition of, restrictive practices and behaviour support, which are highlighted in this bill. This government is strongly committed to providing safe and quality care to all senior Australians, including in residential aged-care settings. These amendments will strengthen protections for aged-care recipients from abuse associated with unregulated use of restrictive practices. This will be achieved by strengthening and clarifying provider responsibilities concerning the use of restrictive practices. This includes strengthening the emphasis on aged-care recipients' rights and the delivery of person centred care, and requiring providers to only use restrictive practices as a last resort, and it must be a last resort following the employment of alternate behaviour support interventions. We do not want to see any more vision of elderly, frail or vulnerable residents being subjected to degrading practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the protection of our most vulnerable is key, the bill also acknowledges that there are some limited circumstances in which restrictive practices may be required around the safety of care of recipients and staff. The bill seeks to clarify that this is a safety measure of last resort where all other interventions have been employed and excluded. Restrictive practices must only be used in a way that supports good clinical practice and provides safe and improved care for care recipients. It can never be used as a method of punishment or as a substitute for inadequate resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the electorate of Cowper, we boast around 80 aged-care facilities that receive government funding and offer a range of services, including residential, transitional and short-term restorative care. Some are leaders in their field and have provided exceptional care and support for their residents while providing employment opportunities for many of our residents. I expect to see a continued expansion of facilities within this industry in the coming years, along with a rising number of residents looking to take up opportunities of home-care packages to help them stay in their homes longer. A similar number of providers offer home-care packages across the electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the ageing population of the Cowper electorate and a strong desire by these residents to remain in their own homes longer, we have strong demand for home-care packages. The Mid North Coast has almost 5½ thousand home-care packages across all four levels. The new number of entries into home-care packages in the last quarter was almost 600. Pleasingly, the number of packages released into the system in the last quarter was 1,314. This effort and the decision made in the 2021 budget show the intent of this government to provide and match the services people need in our area and across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we consider the number of aging residents in Cowper and across the country, it is important also to note Australia's population is aging. A detailed look at the government document <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia to 2050: future challenges</span> shows that between now and 2050 the number of older people 65 to 84 is expected to more than double. People over 85 are expected to more than quadruple, from 400,000 people to 1.8 million in 2050. In contrast, the number of children is expected to increase by only 45 per cent, and the number of prime aged-care working people is expected to increase by only 44 per cent. This means that the proportion of people aged 65 years or over is projected to increase from 13 per cent in 2010 to 23 per cent by June 2050. With an aging population in mind, these amendments become imperative because they provide the necessary security for those residents considering their aged-care options going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is taking positive action. One of the measures in this bill that will gain plenty of traction in the wider community is the assurance reviews. This measure is in response to growing community concerns about some providers charging unfairly high administration charges. The government has committed $6.5 billion over four years from 2021 to release an additional 80,000 home-care packages. This record-breaking investment will support more senior Australians to age comfortably in their own homes. We all want to see this level of support focused primarily on the care and assistance for the recipient. Home-care assurance reviews are designed to protect the integrity of this investment by allowing further oversight of arrangements for the delivery and administration of home care to ensure they are effective and efficient. Some of the issues that will be covered by the assurance review process include how approved providers are using the home-care subsidy and charging for home care, including justifications for amounts charged to care recipients; how approved providers are structuring their financial accounting for home-care services; and the nature and time of home care provided by providers. Whilst it is acknowledged that home-care providers need to cover business costs and overheads, it's imperative that senior Australians are getting the best value for money in the use of their package funds by providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The implications of this bill, specifically the proposed amendments in the bill, relate to restrictive practices, home-care assurance reviews and aged-care financing. This bill defines the term 'restrictive practices' in the Aged Care Act in alignment with the definition applied under the National Disability Insurance Scheme, bringing practice into line with the disability sector. The new definition strengthens protections for care recipients from abuse associated with the unregulated use of restrictive practices. The bill also expands the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's ability to respond to breaches of approved providers' responsibilities in relation to restrictive practices. Assurance reviews will inform the continuous improvement of home-care policy and the education of approved providers in relation to home care and home-care services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to note that the government is investing over $135 million over two years to support the payment of bonuses to registered nurses who remain employed in the aged-care system for 12 months. This is part of the $652.1 million commitment by the government to retain and grow a professional and compassionate workforce within the aged-care industry. In addition, the Aged Care Workforce Industry Council is funded by the government to implement the Aged Care Workforce Strategy. Through this, contract funding is being provided to drive workforce reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, these proposed changes will emphasise person-centred care in relation to the use of restrictive practices through a new definition of restricted practice. The bill also provides legislative detail on the requirement for providers to comply prior to, during and after the use of restrictive practices. With regard to home care: this government also believes that assurance reviews will have a positive impact on the delivery and administration of home care, ensuring that they are both effective and efficient. Program assurance will deliver on the government's commitment to provide senior Australians with affordable and value-for-money home care, and will directly support senior Australians to remain in their homes for as long as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health, safety and wellbeing of senior Australians is of the utmost importance to this government. This is driving our plan for generational change in the aged-care system. These initial amendments form the first step of the government's five-year reform agenda across these five pillars: home care; residential aged-care services and sustainability; residential aged-care quality and safety; workforce; and governance. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  It's often said that the measure of a nation is how well it treats its vulnerable citizens, particularly the elderly—those who helped to build the nation that we live in. Many of them lived through world conflicts and economic upheavals. Many of them were migrants who left their homeland to come to Australia and help build the prosperous nation that we all enjoy today. But, unfortunately, under the Morrison government we have forgotten that adage about how important it is to look after the elderly and those who helped to build our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the royal commission was instituted, we knew that it would uncover a series of shocking incidents that had been reported in our constituencies. When the title of the interim report into the management by those over there of the aged-care sector was one word—<span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>—we knew that there was a problem with their management and stewardship of Australia's aged-care sector. That's exactly what occurred under this government. Because of the coalition-conservative philosophy of cutting services, be they healthcare services, education services, training services or aged-care services, Australians are worse off, and no group is more worse off than our aged Australians. These are the people who helped to build this nation and who have served our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 makes amendments to the Aged Care Act and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act to implement three measures in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and, in the case of restrictive practices, in response to the independent review of legislative provisions governing the use of restraint in residential aged care. While the changes are urgent, the fact is that it has been eight long years, and many Australian families have suffered enough through this government's neglect of our aged-care system. Unfortunately, it's a system which is in crisis. This is a crisis which has emerged on this government's watch, and it was aggravated by the cuts to aged-care funding that have been undertaken by this government. This ensured that funding failed to keep pace with the facts that we have an ageing population and a growing population, and that we weren't providing the necessary support to ensure that aged Australians who either had to enter into home care or residential care did so with dignity and got the care and respect they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission contained some shocking details of the neglect—horror stories of maggots in wounds and that 68 per cent of aged-care residents were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. The royal commission's comprehensive road map for reform was built around 148 recommendations and the government's aged-care package falls short of those royal commission recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill deals with three of those recommendations. But the government has ignored the principal problem in this particular industry, and that is the wages and conditions of those that work in the sector—better professional development, a nutrition-contingent funding boost, minimum staffing levels, guaranteed nurses on duty 24/7 and civil penalties for duty breaches. And there are many more of those royal commission recommendations that still go unanswered, that have not been adopted by this government. I think that the government's approach is, 'We'll do these three and hope that Australia forgets about the other ones.' But Australians won't forget, because this won't fix the neglect that exists in our aged-care sector that was identified by the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has the Morrison government refused to accept the recommendation that requires a registered nurse to be on duty at all times in nursing homes? They're taking the nurses out of nursing homes. It doesn't make sense at all. When this change was introduced—predominantly by Liberal state governments—we warned that there would be consequences for the level of care that aged-care residents received, and that has been the result. There have been cases where the level of care hasn't been up to the standard that Australians would expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has the government refused to even countenance the recommendation to increase the wages of nurses and carers? Unfortunately, we all know that people who are working in our aged-care sector, particularly in residential care, are underpaid and overworked. But I doubt that those opposites know that. I very much doubt that they have ever sat down with a group of aged-care workers and asked them to tell their story and asked them to explain the daily challenges they face just to do their job and care for older Australians. All of them are underpaid, with many of them unable to make ends meet, and therefore have second and third jobs. We've seen through the COVID period the danger that this has caused through transmission between nursing homes. Those that are working in them simply can't earn enough to make ends meet, so they have to have a job in another residential aged-care facility just to pay their bills. That of course ended up with COVID transmission going between those nursing homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have workers in nursing homes being employed by labour hire companies—not even employed directly by the nursing home company that they're working for—as a distinct tactic to lower their wages and conditions. So they're working for base-level wages and having to have two or three jobs just to make ends meet. We're talking about an occupation in which you do need quite a level of training. There's a fair degree of skill and competence involved. But, more importantly, there's an emotional element that many Australians are simply unqualified to deliver and which would challenge a lot of us—the emotional element of having to deal on a daily basis with people who have dementia, with people whose faculties are going, with people who wander off on a regular basis, with people who can't remember your name from the day before and with people who, unfortunately, you create a bond with and then they pass away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The emotional element involved in this job has, sadly, been ignored by this government and by governments in the past for too long. That is something that the royal commission recognised and it is something that the Fair Work Commission, on numerous occasions in fair work cases and pay equity cases, has recognised as an issue that needs to be dealt with if we're going to provide the necessary care and support for people who are in our aged-care facilities. But this government completely ignores it. As a result, the Australians that are living in these facilities aren't getting the care and support that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government also needs to explain how 80,000 additional home-care packages will go to clearing a list that has been stuck at over 100,000 for years. We welcome the additional funding for aged-care packages in homes. It's important in ensuring that people get the care that they deserve so that they can stay in their homes for as long as possible and avoid the need to go prematurely into residential care, because residential care costs more, you tend to get a decay in the quality of life of people when they move into residential aged care earlier than would otherwise be the case, and, of course, there is a quality-of-life element associated with it. Yet this government has refused for years to countenance the fact that we've had over 100,000 people in Australia waiting for aged-care packages. Many of them are at level 4—the highest level of care—and are waiting for support from this government. Unfortunately, many of them die whilst they're waiting for an aged-care package. That shouldn't happen in a nation like Australia, where we have relative wealth and high living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point is that thousands more will seek home-care packages over the budget forward estimates, because we've got an ageing population. It's a demographic characteristic of Australia that we can't ignore—that we have an ageing population—and we're about to have another <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span> released by the government that will demonstrate once again that the number of Australians who are of working age and who are working and paying taxes is diminishing compared to those who are retiring from the workforce and ageing and requiring additional health services and aged-care services that we simply don't have the ability to fund under this government. Nothing in this package does anything to look to the future and to the growth that you're going to find in the waiting list for those aged-care packages. The Prime Minister hasn't shown an ounce of contrition or acknowledged that it was on his watch that there were cuts made to the aged-care budget that have worsened the crisis. The fact is that, when it comes to aged care, it is the Commonwealth that is responsible. It is the Commonwealth that has the responsibility for making sure that we have standards of quality and for giving an assurance to people that there will be adequate funding at a national level to ensure that not only people living in their homes but also those living in residential care get the quality of support that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking to a provider in my electorate some weeks ago, as a result of having received an email from a concerned son who had a parent living in residential aged care. The son had asked me why that particular facility had cut out support services that were there to ensure a quality of life for the residents, such as services that assist with, and reduce the onset of, dementia—cognitive skills development and services like that. He was asking why those services were being cut from this particular aged-care facility. When I phoned the provider, the answer they gave me was quite a simple one. They said: 'We don't get any increases in funding that would allow us to continue to provide these services. We're under the pump, and we can't continue to provide these services because we can't fund them.' That was a not-for-profit provider that couldn't continue to fund those services because they hadn't got the necessary funding per bed to keep pace with changes in the cost of living and population growth—what's known as growth funding—and to ensure that those services could continue to be provided. Hopefully, some of the additional funding that's been announced by the government in the budget will go to ensuring that those services that are important to people's quality of life in residential aged care can be restored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is it should never have got to this. The Australian public have been warning this government for the past eight years that there has been a problem, that the aged-care waiting list has been ballooning—despite the fact we've had <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational reports</span>—and this government has refused to countenance a way to provide that growth funding. It is always on about cutting services and cutting back on that necessary expenditure to provide that support for people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point to make about the government's additional commitments is they haven't announced how they're going to fund them. No details have been announced about how they're going to fund these additional home-care packages and the additional funding that is to be provided per bed in residential facilities. And that's important, because if you're going to make sure that the funding is sustainable into the future, those details need to be released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summation, this government have dropped the ball when it comes to aged care. They're finally getting on with implementing some of the recommendations, but they need to look at the other ones as well. And before I finish, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. Aged care is a huge part of the annual budget of this nation, and there are many constituents in my electorate who are in residential aged-care facilities. The royal commission has uncovered gaps in the standard and some very distressing practices in some nursing homes. But, I must say, the quality of care in the Lyne electorate in the facilities that I've visited over the last 30 years has been second to none. These amendments amend the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act 2018. It introduces three main measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first regards the use of what are called restrictive practices. There were some egregious abuses of physical restraint and chemical restraint uncovered, as they should have been, documented by family members and friends who visited nursing homes. That's why the royal commission was there. There always has to be consent for these sorts of measures, either from family or guardians or the patients themselves. It is a fact of life that in aged-care facilities some aged-care residents get quite agitated and distressed and can be quite confused and violent, particularly around sundown—the so-called sundowning effect. While they need care, love and attention, that agitation and confusion may require physical restraint. But this bill now sets a much higher bar to establish consent and all other measures before the use of either physical restraint or chemical restraint. The other major change that this amending legislation makes is to the Aged Care Financing Authority, such that an advisory body will be created in its stead to advise the minister on aged-care funding matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big response in this bill is to set up a quality assurance program for the ever-expanding home-care system. As you know, there has been a huge backlog in constituents who have been approved for a home-care package but there hasn't been the workforce for it, but one thing that there has been no shortage of is the increased funding over the last three to four years. It's absolutely expanded exponentially. But a quality assurance review will monitor the delivery and administration to ensure that it is effective and efficient. It will support continuous improvement and policy development in relation to home care. It will inform further education of approved providers in relation to their responsibilities. It does empower the Department of Health to require approved providers and their employees to provide information about their quality assurance program. It also empowers the health department to name those providers who do not comply with notices to produce such information and publish reports on the assurance reviews. It is a very important issue, and these three things will be a significant improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you understand, we have committed $17.7 billion to improving aged care because Australia's senior citizens in some cases unfortunately weren't getting the quality of care that is demanded. Increased funding will definitely fix some of those problems. But there is a phenomenon happening in aged care in that it is very difficult to get aged-care staff. Not every person working in a nursing home or an aged-care facility needs to be a registered nurse. There can be assistants in nursing, enrolled nurses and personal-care workers. The main thing is it's an old person's home; it's not a hospital like an intensive care or a surgical ward. So you need registered nurses in some of the situations but not all. I think it would be a real tragedy if we tried to turn nursing homes into hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem is that, with the NDIS funding expanding and the NDIS expanding, a lot of healthcare workers in aged care are moving over to NDIS work because the payment is far higher. A lot of staff are being cannibalised from the aged-care system and going into unskilled, higher-paid work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> I was just about to complete my speech. These three reforms are an important response to the aged-care royal commission, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Scott Morrison has neglected older Australians and the aged-care system for eight long years, bringing it to the point where it is a national disgrace. When it comes to older Australians, this government has just two settings: carelessness and callousness. This is a generation that has given so much. They deserve our gratitude and our respect, but what they've got from this Prime Minister and his government is contempt and neglect—a government that has turned its back on them, a government that produced, finally, support for a royal commission after years of campaigning from this side of the House. And, when that royal commission produced its interim report in 2019, it had a one-word title that summed up the state of aged care in this country, and that title was <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. In one word they summed up this government's attitude towards aged care and towards older Australians, older Australians who built this nation; older Australians who've worked, who have paid their taxes, who have raised children and grandchildren; older Australians who are entitled, in their later years, to live with dignity and respect. We saw last week an attack on the retirement incomes of future older Australians with the government's attacks on superannuation. The government want to reduce the living standards of older Australians in the future, and, when it comes to those who may need aged care either in the home or in aged-care homes, they neglect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety's final report and its 148 recommendations make it absolutely clear Australia's aged-care system is one that is in crisis. Royal commissioner Lynelle Briggs summed it up. This is a royal commissioner who is an esteemed Australian, a former public service commissioner, someone who has had great experience in the public service here in Canberra and has served governments of all persuasions over a long period of time, someone whose appointment by this government signalled that this government respected her views, and this is what she had to say in her statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At times in this inquiry, it has felt like the government's main consideration was what was the minimum commitment it could get away with, rather than what should be done to sustain the aged care system so that it is enabled to deliver high quality and safe care. This must change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a damning indictment by the government's own royal commissioner Lynelle Briggs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is responsible for this debacle. It is the Prime Minister who was personally responsible for the funding cuts. It is the Prime Minister who was responsible for the terrible neglect that has been identified in this royal commission. Our most vulnerable citizens, those who require care in their later years, are being neglected—maggots crawling from underneath bandages! There was the damning indictment of half of the residents of aged-care facilities being malnourished, half literally starving, and we know that some of that is a direct result of coalition ideology put into practice, coalition ideology that was all for the for-profit sector coming into aged care. We know that some people have done very well out of it, with their his and her Lamborghinis, driving around the suburbs of our capital cities. At the same time those older Australians in their care are literally not being given enough to eat. The coalition have had eight years in government, and over those eight years it has got worse, and giving them another three years won't fix aged care. Older Australians can't afford another three years of this government. The only thing that will fix aged care is a change of government, a government committed to caring for Australians throughout their lives from child care in their early years to Medicare in their middle years through to aged care in their later years. We, on this side of the House, care. It is a great divide in Australian politics with those on this side of the House who care about those people we represent, whether they live in our cities or our regions, whether they're men or women, whether they're young or old, whether they're wealthy or not. We care about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite just care about themselves, and we've seen that today, in the middle of a pandemic, when they focused, just as they did during the bushfire crisis, on themselves with the replacement of a Deputy Prime Minister and the failed and flawed Barnaby Joyce coming back into the position of Deputy Prime Minister. Even though this scandal-ridden former Deputy Prime Minister had to resign in shame as a result of things that he was directly responsible for, they would have us believe, and the Australian people believe, that all of that will just be forgotten. A thoroughly decent man, the current Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McCormack, has been driven out—hounded out—of office, just showing once again their priority. Instead of concentrating on fixing aged care, fixing that crisis and fixing the rollout of the vaccine, what is their priority? Rolling the Deputy Prime Minister. We on this side say to Australians that we are on your side. Those opposite, we know, are on their own side, as seen in their actions. And now they're going to bring back the person responsible for sports rorts, who had to resign for using taxpayer funds inappropriately. But all's forgiven there as well. What a farce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that in 2019, when that interim report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span> came down, the government could have acted. They could have put extra money into aged care, could have reduced the home-care waiting list, could have addressed the malnourishment that was happening, could have addressed issues such as regulation of aged care. But they did absolutely nothing. They waited until just before a federal election to say: 'We'd better put a few dollars back in. We've got a trillion dollars of debt, so let's not worry about the fiscal measures here.' But we know that after the next election, if they're successful, the cuts will come. We know the deferrals of increased funding will come. We know that the excuses will be there. They'll say, 'We've got to change,' just as they did in 2014. But when they had the opportunity, they slashed and burned the budget, and they would do the same thing again. The fact is this Prime Minister has selective hearing. His hearing fails whenever experts are speaking to him. His hearing fails whenever people with experience are speaking to him. He failed to listen to Australians in aged care, to their families and to the workers in the system. He failed to listen to the findings in 22 expert reports, and now he's even failed to listen to his own royal commission. When the Prime Minister talks about quiet Australians, they're not actually quiet; it's just that he doesn't want to listen to them. He doesn't want to hear what they're saying. Now they can't be trusted, with the spectre of an election, to respond appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to the royal commission and the aged-care crisis through this legislation falls short—massively short. It fails to deliver lasting improvements and reforms and it simply ignores many key recommendations. The Prime Minister must explain why he has rejected those key recommendations. For example, he must explain why he has rejected the call to have a nurse on duty in residential care 24/7, a key recommendation to improve care. It shouldn't be beyond the comprehension of the Prime Minister and those opposite, given the royal commission, to get the idea that nursing homes, as we used to call them, should have nurses. But, apparently, that's beyond their comprehension because this legislation before us today doesn't respond to that. There is nothing in this legislation either that will deal with the issue of the underpayment and overwork which aged-care workers have to suffer, nothing at all; there's no improvement there. We on this side of the House have said very clearly that we would support a case before the Fair Work Commission for an equal value case, as we did with other feminised industries—as we did with the social and community services award in 2012, in the Gillard government. How is it the case that an aged-care worker doing heavy physical work as well as mentally stressful work can be paid more for stacking shelves than for looking after vulnerable Australians? How is that the case? I have met with those workers, many of them largely from migrant backgrounds and overwhelmingly female, who are in it because of their compassion. They say that the people they look after are their friends. The idea that they're unable to look after them is just extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also hasn't fully implemented the recommendations around transparency and accountability. The royal commission made a recommendation to increase the basic daily fee to providers of $10 per bed per day, to address widespread malnourishment. Just think about that—$10 per bed per day, to feed people. Maybe there is someone on the other side who thinks that they can feed a loved one for $10 per bed per day, but it just says it all. The royal commission recommended that strict reporting requirements be attached to this condition. Are any reporting requirements part of this legislation to make sure that the money actually goes into care and better food? Not at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contempt for the aged-care sector has been brought home by the current pandemic as well. Aged-care residents and aged-care workers were supposed to be in category 1a, right at the front of that queue—and we know the queue was supposed to be at the front of the world. But we find that now, in late June, aged-care residents still haven't been fully vaccinated, and the government has no idea how many aged-care workers have been vaccinated, because they told them, 'Just go and see your GP.' There are no records. What could go wrong? They also removed the requirement limiting aged-care workers to one residence during the pandemic and then wondered why the virus spread, when we know that overwhelmingly the deaths here in Australia from COVID-19 were of aged-care residents, and that a large part of that was from workers working in multiple facilities in order to put food on the table for their families. Yet this government lifted the restriction there. They said there would be 13 vaccine clinics for aged-care and disability workers set up by the end of May. There are three, and they're all in Sydney. They just don't care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this government have failed when it comes to aged care. They have presided over eight years of neglect. This legislation doesn't fix the problem. It doesn't even respond to the recommendations of their own royal commission. It is very clear that this legislation won't fix it, but a Labor government will.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I am pleased to rise today in support of this vital bill, the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, and to inform members on both sides of the House of the tangible steps the Morrison government is taking to improve the viability and efficiency of our aged-care system, something near and dear to the hearts of all members on this side of the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Morrison government announced the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, we knew this comprehensive review would uncover some hard truths. Australians have the right to expect that all aged-care residents are treated with respect and dignity. Unfortunately, the royal commission has discovered some sobering realities about aged-care delivery in Australia. Unlike previous governments, however, we are acting decisively to get on with the job of implementing these substantial reforms that will shape our aged-care system for many generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I elaborate on the immediate benefits of this bill, I want to unreservedly thank all former and current aged-care workers, particularly in our electorate of Ryan. At no time have the findings of the royal commission been used to cast blame or dishonour on the vital work that you do, and I, along with all the members on this side of the chamber thank you for all that you are doing in the aged-care sector. Families across Australia place a significant amount of trust in aged-care workers to care for and nurture their loved ones in their senior years, and our government is committing to providing the legislative frameworks to better facilitate this trust. Particularly during the COVID pandemic, the important role that these workers played on our front line was evident. They have done a tremendous job in tough circumstances, and I congratulate them again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill directly addresses the findings of the royal commission, which, as I said, told the nation some hard truths about our current sector. The Prime Minister, when he announced it, warned exactly that that would be the case. The bill will bolster our aged-care legislation to ensure all residents receive safe and effective care. This bill clarifies the parameters that aged-care providers must meet, particularly when it comes to restrictive practices. These important clarifications will ensure that aged-care providers meet robust requirements and operate within strict guidelines in administering this practice in order to guarantee that this practice is delivered safely and effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill takes tangible steps to address recommendation 17 of the royal commission and supports recommendations 27 and 118 of the royal commission's final report. Although this bill is an essential step in addressing the findings of the royal commission, we recognise that it will not be the only legislative reform to aged care. This is not a 'set and forget' area of policy for this government. We are continually looking at how we can better support the aged-care sector, its workers and its residents. Our history as a government in addressing aged care is substantive and does not involve some of the superficial and bandaid solutions that we saw from those opposite during their time in government. This bill helps underpin this swift and decisive action to address some of the shortcomings of the aged-care sector. We're committed to implementing more meaningful reforms that will dramatically improve aged care for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the Labor Party talk a big game on aged care, at no stage have they provided anything that remotely constitutes a costed plan to tackle this critical issue. Although the Morrison government would appreciate bipartisan support on aged care, which affects all of us, as you saw from the speech that preceded mine, the Labor Party are simply interested in scoring cheap political points. That is underscored by the speech we just heard from the Leader of the Opposition in which he spoke more about the Nationals leadership than he did about aged care and the challenges facing the sector. When the Prime Minister, as one of his first steps in office, announced the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, again, the Labor Party were nowhere to be found. Rather than supporting this difficult but necessary royal commission, they were instead plotting to address the issue the same way they address any issue of importance, and that is by increasing taxes. The Labor Party have never seen a problem that they didn't think they could solve by reaching into your pocket to take more taxes. This is a bandaid solution. Labor members say: 'Trust us, we're the party that knows how to operate aged care,' but they never thought to call a royal commission when they were in government, and they continue to offer very little in the way of measures to address the findings of the final report. We on this side of the House will not forget—and Australians won't forget—that the Labor Party's answer to supporting senior Australians in the 2019 election was $387 billion in taxes, including the retiree tax. The Australian people know better than to believe the convoluted claims of the Labor Party when it comes to aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every Australian, especially aged-care residents and workers. The Morrison government acted decisively in the interests of the aged-care sector to provide economic and health support to ensure that they had the resources they needed to help us deal with the pandemic. I remain actively engaged with local aged-care facilities in my electorate of Ryan, such as the Cairns centre at Chapel Hill, which have risen to the challenge of COVID-19 in trying circumstances. And they were very trying circumstances—particularly the lockdowns during which friends and families could not get in to see their relatives in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cairns centre in Chapel Hill in particular has a sizeable dementia ward. Those in care at the dementia ward often rely on their partners who are not living in that care facility to visit them on a daily basis for the support, particularly emotional support, that they require. Some of the toughest circumstances that I was confronted with during the COVID-19 pandemic included helping these families navigate their way back into aged care to support their loved ones, but that we did. The Cairns centre themselves reached out to the Prime Minister and to myself to offer feedback on the support offered by the Morrison government during this time. The Cairns centre said: 'We feel safe in your hands knowing that you have our best interests at heart. The direction has been a great help in clarity to help us plan our lives, enabling us to put what is necessary into practice effectively, and was of great assistance in reducing the risk and promoting excellence in care.' This is from the aged-care providers at the Cairns home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 360,000 aged-care workers across Australia continue to care for some of our most vulnerable members of our society and they know the Morrison government is committed to supporting them through this difficult time. Upon medical expert advice our vaccine rollout was tailored to prioritise aged-care workers and residents and to ensure that they receive targeted support to successfully administer the vaccine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senior Australians have contributed so much to our society. We owe them a tremendous debt. They've helped foster the values and ethos of our nation and continue to act as role models for much of our younger generation. All Australians have the right to rest assured that older members of their family who are residing in aged care are treated with the utmost dignity and respect. This bill is an important step in the reform of the aged-care sector that is so desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government continues to deliver record investments in aged care across the country not only to improve aged-care services but to retain and attract more aged-care workers to continue the vital work that they do caring for our senior Australians. Following the final report of the royal commission, the Morrison government will deliver $17.7 billion of funding to reform the sector and ensure that Australians in aged care are treated with respect and dignity. This is the largest investment in aged-care history and is bolstered by tangible and pragmatic steps to increase the viability of the sector. This includes 33,800 subsidies for the vocational education and training places through the Morrison government's JobTrainer initiative that encourage Australians to contribute and participate in the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This side of the House is not posturing when it comes to aged care. We have a record investment that includes more home-care packages, new Aged Care Quality Standards and a more streamlined assessment process, creating a better overall experience for aged-care residents. The 2021-22 budget has delivered a record investment in aged care to help the 20,394 senior Australians living in the electorate of Ryan. This investment will deliver additional home-care places, more funding for residential aged care and increase the amount of time residents are cared for, while strengthening regulators to monitor and enforce the important standards of care that this government has put in place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the significance of this investment we're not increasing taxes or shifting the burden on to future Australians. Unlike those opposite, this government will continue to invoke meaningful reforms and investment in aged care and we will do it through a strong and well-managed economy. Following the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the Morrison government will continue to fully support this comprehensive and thorough process. While this is the first bill—as I said, it addresses the findings of the royal commission—there is a long way to go in meeting and facing up to those hard truths that the royal commission has outlined. But as I said, this is not a set-and-forget policy area for us. This bill is simply a step along a path of meaningful reform for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people know that for real action on aged care those opposite will result only in higher taxes and bandaid solutions. In contrast, this government will continue to act swiftly and decisively to ensure that aged-care residents and aged-care workers are supported and treated with dignity and respect. I am very proud to be part of the Morrison government, that has committed this record amount in the measures in this bill, in supporting and building a strong aged-care workforce and delivering the highest possible standards of care to our senior Australians. I wholeheartedly commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 because the Australian aged-care system is in crisis. The coalition government has neglected older Australians for the past eight years, and we now have a royal commission that sets out for us just how damning that neglect is. Their record on aged care speaks volumes. Under this government there's been a $1.7 billion cut from the sector; nearly 11,000 deaths of people who were waiting for home care in the past year; 685 deaths from coronavirus during the pandemic; and chronic understaffing, malnutrition and neglect in facilities. The royal commission into aged care set all of this out. It highlighted graphically the tragic outcomes of a system of neglect and failures all round—and the government have had eight years to do something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government have neglected older Australians and neglected aged-care residents and aged-care workers for eight years. These are the people who built our country. These are our parents, our family members and our community members. What does it say about all of us, what does it say about the community we want, that we are prepared to put up with these conditions? What does it say when this government is still failing to act on the recommendations of that damning royal commission? It is a cliche to use the phrase 'damning reading', but it does describe the experience of reading the report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Commissioner Lynelle Briggs found that an 'absence of government leadership and stewardship of the system has meant that obvious and longstanding problems have not been dealt with'. That absence created a system that left Commissioner Briggs wondering whether as a community we had lost our moral compass, so poor is the system now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission was the government's chance—it is the government's chance—after eight years of leadership failure, to reset and to build a system that respects older Australians. The royal commission made 148 recommendations, and the government's response to those recommendations is nothing short of disappointing. The government have delayed and rejected key recommendations. Some of the problems with the government's response include not reforming workforce issues, this huge issue that is sitting there. There is nothing in the government's response to improve wages for overstretched and undervalued aged-care workers—the bedrock of our system. On funding commitments, they are gifting $3.2 billion to providers with no strings attached to ensure that this goes to actual care and better food and not into the pockets of unscrupulous providers. They have failed to clear the home-care package waiting list of 100,000 people, yet I know that so many people in my community want to age at home. They've ignored the recommendation to require a nurse to be on duty 24/7 in residential care—something that's core to improving care. And they haven't implemented the main increase to mandatory care minutes in residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that staffing levels are central to so many of the quality problems in residential aged care, yet this government's response ignores the fact that the workforce we rely on to care for people in residential aged care is underpaid. They're not supported to have a long-term career. They're not supported to have a job that pays them decent conditions. We see the results of this all round. During the pandemic we have seen what that means for workers having to work across multiple facilities when they are not vaccinated and when they're having to go between facilities and the risk that creates for both these workers and for people in those facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own community I know that one of the things that people were most concerned about at the start of this winter, as Melbourne was in its fourth lockdown, was the fact that aged-care workers were not vaccinated and that aged-care workers were left without supplementary payments that meant that they were able to work at just one facility instead of having to work across facilities. After what we endured last year in Melbourne, after all the deaths we saw in aged care, after all the workers we saw who were put at risk, this government failed to vaccinate them and failed to put in place the plans that would allow them to just work in one facility. That goes to this government's whole attitude towards the aged-care system: it's a hands-off, not-my-responsibility, nothing-to-see-here and nothing-to-fix-here attitude. Well, that's not good enough. This government is leaving aged-care workers and aged-care residents out of the supports they need and out of the types of support and system that we should have in a country that truly values our older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not be scared about a future where we enter aged care, and yet that is where most members of our community are. I know this because they come and tell me. They tell me, 'I don't want my mum and dad to go in there; I've seen what happens.' They're scared, and the people who are entering those facilities are scared. They should not be, and yet this government is failing to respond to the recommendations of the royal commission. It is failing to put in place the wholesale change—the real change—that will fix this system and will value this system going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that our aged-care system needs fixing. We know that it's broken and we know it needs fixing, and we will do the work to fix it. We will make sure that aged-care residents are valued. We will make sure that aged-care workers are paid as they should be. We will make sure that this is a system that works for people, not for providers and their profits. We will make sure that this royal commission does not go to waste and that older Australians are treated with the dignity and respect that they should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's positive that there are amendments relating to restrictive practices in this bill and while it's positive that we have some amendments relating to home-care assurance reviews, and also amendments relating to the Aged Care Financing Authority, they're not enough: we deserve better. From the beginning of this year, I have known how hard and difficult it has been for people in my community in looking at the situation in aged care and the vaccine rollout. We have the situation of unvaccinated workers, residents at risk and a system that isn't getting the fix that it needs. This government cannot drag the chain anymore. It cannot fail to respond as it should—it must respond to all the recommendations and it must fix our aged-care system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  The royal commission has made the clear case for reform in aged care in Australia, and the government is determined to ensure that senior Australians receive safe aged-care services of good quality through record funding of $17.7 billion over the next five years. Today I am speaking on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, because aged care is one of the most important and urgent reform priorities for the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise 'reform' because simply increasing funding will not automatically deliver the care and safety improvements required in the sector. The government committed to these reforms in March, following the release of the royal commission's final report. The first stage of reform will address three key areas. The first area is strengthening legislative requirements on the use of restrictive practices. The second area introduces home-care assurance reviews and the third repeals the legislative requirement to have the Aged Care Financing Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends two acts: the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act 2018. As an overview, these changes will achieve the following: the terminology will be brought into line with the disability sector, so the term 'restraint' will be replaced with 'restrictive practices'. Restrictive practices will be governed by requirements that are both stricter and clearer, and must be met by approved providers. This will provide better protection for aged-care recipients. The Quality of Care Principles 2014 will be used to proscribe new requirements on approved providers when using restrictive practices. Noncompliance with the new requirements for restrictive practices will be dealt with by the expanded powers of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner. That will include the ability to issue a written notice, and a civil penalty will apply for failure by a provider to comply with a written notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Home care will be subject to greater scrutiny, including the implementation of an annual program of assurance reviews for approved providers. This will improve the integrity of home care and increase oversight of home-care charges. The intent is that the oversight promotes better value for money for the government and of course for care recipients. Home-care assurance reviews will support improvements in three key areas: they will monitor home-care delivery and administration to ensure they're effective and, indeed efficient; continuous improvement and policy development; and informed further education of approved providers in relation to their responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater transparency will be an important tool of reform under this bill, which should improve both the outcomes of and confidence in the aged-care system. The Secretary of the Department of Health will now have the power to do the following: require approved providers and their employees to provide information for the purpose of program assurance; publish information about providers who do not comply with notices to produce information; and prepare and publish reports on the assurance reviews. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many Australians wish to live in their own homes for as long as possible, and that is happening. The government is committed to affordable, value-for-money home care and extra home-care packages. The combination of program assurance and funding will support that very objective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides for a new non-legislative advisory group to replace the Aged Care Financing Authority, known as ACFA. The new advisory group will commence from 1 July 2021 and provide advice to government on aged-care financing issues. To facilitate that change, the ACFA requirement is removed from the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is pursuing generational change of the aged-care system. This bill is part of the more comprehensive five-year reform process, with five key pillars. I'll outline what they are for those listening at home who want to know what the five key pillars of reform are. They are: home care; residential aged-care services and sustainability; residential aged care quality and safety; workforce; and, of course, governance. Many people in Moncrieff and across Australia will be interested in further details on the reform process and the bill that I just outlined. I'll now delve into some of those details. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time frames for the reforms are as follows. On 1 July this year, new restrictive practices regulations will commence. That's straight away. That's in couple of weeks. On 1 November 2021, this year again, the home-care assurance reviews will be implemented. The Aged Care Financing Authority will be abolished by the assent of the bill itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission identified abuse associated with the unregulated use of restrictive practices. The reforms delivered by this bill in relation to restrictive practices are therefore one of the very important ways that this government is acting to protect aged-care recipients. The bill will deliver reforms in the following ways: it will strengthen and clarify provider responsibilities concerning the use of restrictive practices; it will strengthen the emphasis on aged-care recipient rights and the delivery of person centred care, which is so important; and it will require providers to only use restrictive practices as a very last resort following the employment of alternative behaviour-support interventions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to point out that, whilst the terminology of restrictive practices is being harmonised across aged care and the NDIS, which means it will be the same, the authorisation processes remain different, for good reason. Under the NDIS arrangements, each state and territory is responsible for the authorisation of restrictive practices in accordance with relevant state and territory legislative and/or policy requirements. The different authorisation processes reflect differences in the likely care needs. In disability care, for example, the care recipient is more likely to have stable needs. In an aged-care setting, fluctuations in care needs and deterioration of various conditions are far more likely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arrangements for informed consent will be clarified and strengthened by this bill. The legislation also recognises that state and territory legislation specifies who can consent to the use of restrictive practices for a care recipient and who cannot consent because of physical or mental incapacity. The government is not seeking to harmonise consent arrangements across states and territories with this bill. This will be considered in the longer term and with consideration given to harmonising consent arrangements across care and support sectors, including the disability sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill doesn't prohibit restrictive practices. It makes them a last resort for the safety of staff and especially for care recipients. In relation to restrictive practices, this is what the bill will deliver: clarity that other interventions must first have been utilised or excluded as not suitable before resorting to restrictive practices; the requirement that restrictive practices only be used in a way that supports good clinical practice and provides safe and improved care for care recipients; and the prohibition of the use of restrictive practices as a method of punishment or as a substitute for inadequate resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, this bill also makes the use of restrictive practices outside the circumstances permitted by legislation reportable under the serious incident reporting scheme. It does not expand or authorise the use of restrictive practices where it is otherwise unlawful. They are very important points. It provides the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner with the power to issue a written notice if a provider does not comply with its responsibilities relating to the use of those restrictive practices. It provides a civil penalty for breach of compliance with a written notice. This tough, but fair, measure is the first time a penalty has been implemented for those particular circumstances, should they arise. It is not overregulation, because we're preventing abuse. This bill is helping to prevent abuse. Approved providers of residential aged care are already required to minimise the use of physical and chemical restraint in accordance with part 4A of the Quality of Care Principles 2014. The government is clarifying the legislation to avoid confusion and to strengthen compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've outlined, the bill will improve aged-care quality and safety in direct response to recommendations of the royal commission. The government will go further by appointing a senior practitioner to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission in 2021 this year. That appointment will lead an education campaign for the aged-care sector and general practitioners to minimise the use of restrictive practices, and provide senior Australians and their families with an independent review mechanism to ensure aged-care providers are complying with their legislative obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, the Morrison government is extremely supportive of the desire of many Australians to remain in their homes for as long as possible as they age. The government is cognisant of the quality and safety of home care and the value that care recipients and the government obtain from investing in that home care. Home-care assurance reviews are therefore very important. There has been understandable community concern that some providers charge unreasonable admin fees. To address these community concerns and to protect the integrity of this significant government investment—as I said, $17.7 billion over five years—the government is implementing further oversight through home-care assurance reviews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of a comprehensive reform process that is focused on respect, care and dignity for older Australians. The Morrison government is investing an additional $17.7 billion of funding into the sector—I've said it again for a third time—in response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. We are determined that this reform will deliver the high quality of care that Australians deserve. It will ensure the safety of those care services. It will ensure more control and choice for Australians regarding their care arrangements and that those care recipients are treated with dignity and respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if this issue related to the care of one Australian, how we treat one aged person, it would be a test of our decency as a society. The scale of the aged-care system underscores the importance of that test and quantifies the significant resources needed to address the dramatic improvements required. Just consider that around 1.3 million Australians access aged-care services today. There will be more than seven million Australians over 65 by the middle of the century. The Morrison government's investment of $17.7 billion over the forward estimates will include an annual figure that will reach $5.5 billion by 2023-24. Whilst these large figures demonstrate that the investment by the Morrison government is commensurate with the scale of this challenge, it's important to understand that we're also moving with urgency, as is appropriate. In calling for and responding to the royal commission, at each step the Morrison government has sought to address the immediate priorities to improve the aged-care system, investing $552 million when the royal commission was first established, $537 million at the time of the interim report, $132.2 million in direct response to the COVID-19 special report and $452 million for immediate priority actions in response to the final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Care, dignity and respect</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is not just a government response. Providers and the workforce will be our partners in reform of our aged-care system, as they must be. As I mentioned previously, the reform responding to the commission will be shaped by five pillars, with significant funding for the improvement of each of them. I'll outline them quickly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pillar 1 is $7.5 billion in home care, with $6.5 billion for an additional 80,000 home-care packages. This is good news for older Australians. With these additional 80,000 home-care packages, 40,000 will be released in 2021-22 and 40,000 in 2022-23, which will make a total of 275,598 packages available to senior Australians by June 2023. Key pillar 2 is $7.8 billion for residential aged-care services and sustainability, which is also a very important pillar. I won't go through all the dot points I've got here because I see I'm always running out of time speaking on these bills. Pillar No. 3 is $942 million for residential aged-care quality and safety, which is a very important part of the reform. Pillar 4 is $652.1 million going to workforce, those important training places, with $228.2 million to create a single assessment workforce to undertake all assessments that will improve and simplify the assessment experience for senior Australians as they enter or progress within the aged-care system. An additional $135.6 million is to provide eligible registered nurses with financial support of $3,700 for full-time workers and $2,700 for part-time workers. Pillar 5 is $698.3 million that's going into governance to ensure that there is good governance for the National Aged Care Advisory Council, a Council of Elders, and work towards the establishment of a new Inspector-General of Aged Care. Going forward, the drafting of a new Aged Care Act over the next two years will seek to embed the Morrison government reforms that I've just outlined for the House into the aged-care sector. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  There are many lessons to be learnt from the royal commission into aged care. We had a royal commission which reminded some in Australia that aged care matters, that it is a fundamental part of our society and that if we fail on aged care it hurts all Australians. Older Australians have spent their lives working for Australia. We in this place owe it to them to ensure we have the highest quality aged-care system we can have, one that doesn't deprive them of dignity but celebrates them in their old age, and one that does not punish them. The numbers in the aged-care system are significant. In 2020 some 335,889 Australians were using some form of aged care. The federal government last year spent some $21.2 billion on aged care. This should be a source of pride for the government, spending a large amount of money supporting many hundreds of thousands of Australians. But, as the royal commission told us, what is currently happening in our aged-care system is a source of shame. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 is needed, and the Labor Party supports it. But, as the royal commission made clear, there is much more that needs to be done. There is much more that needs to be done although this government has had eight years in charge of this system. They have had eight years when it's been under their watch and, after almost eight years, we did see a plan put forward on budget night to spend $17.7 billion on aged care. But, as is customary with this government, the plan is lacking the transparency that the public would expect about where that money goes and how it actually improves the quality of aged care. What we've seen is a $3.2 billion cheque to supplement the basic daily fee, with $10 per resident. But we've had no assurance on whether that goes to food, cleaning, health care, wages—we just don't know. When you hear a story like that and the government's approach is 'money in, no reform', you start to get a picture of how we've ended up with a trillion dollars of government debt in this country. The royal commission did provide the road map and it did provide findings that were horrifying. While this bill addresses some of those problems, it is only a very small step in the right direction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission outlined 148 recommendations—some straightforward and sensible, some heartbreaking even to admit that we need to do. It took almost three years to get the final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, a bit longer than expected. It was a pretty shocking report. In it's own words, the royal commission's said it was a 'woefully inadequate' system. It is a system in which Australians 'have their basic human rights denied'. The royal commission said that when it comes to Australians living in aged care: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Their dignity is not respected and their identity is ignored. It is most certainly not a full life. It is a shocking tale of neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One in three Australians using the current system experience some form of substandard care. What we saw in the royal commission was not a mystery, but the commission made very clear what causes these issues and what needs to be done to address them. Our aged-care system is poorly funded, poorly governed and poorly led, and Australians are the poorer for it. When we come to the question of physical or chemical restraints, these rob Australians of their dignity and of their autonomy. In just a few months in 2020, the instances of restraint numbered in the tens of thousands. Stories like this, at that scale, do not belong in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to acknowledge that, while we have a large number of residents in aged care, we have a huge chunk of our neighbours, family and friends working in aged care. This bill fails when it comes to the urgent and pressing needs of workforce for aged care in Australia. The last census estimated that some 366,000 Australians worked in aged care, two-thirds in direct care roles. Most of these workers are women. In budget week we had a number of those women here talking to us about what they need to be able to keep doing jobs that they love. As they are always forced to point out, love doesn't pay the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with one worker, Jude, who's a proud Western Australian. She came all the way here to parliament in budget week to share her story. She said that she gets out of bed every day because she wants to care for people. She's worked in aged care for a long time. She's seen this government's record on aged care. She was disappointed in what she saw in the budget and its complete lack of support for workers. She's worked in aged care for decades. She's seen workers pushed out of the system, burnt out, underpaid and underappreciated. The royal commission confirmed this. It said that many of the workers in aged care are overwhelmed, underfunded or out of their depth. And, again, we have a lack of investment in proper training when it comes to aged care. By the time we get to 2050 it's estimated we'll need a million direct care workers. That is a huge part of our economy. We need workers like Jude, and Jude is not going to be there. She's close to retirement. She told me that it's estimated that, within the next two years, some 15,000 of the workers in aged care will be over the age of 60. This is not sustainable. People who work in aged care do a fantastic job, but they're doing too much of it—for love, not for money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, I want to acknowledge there are a lot of people who volunteer in the aged-care sector, whether it be providing friendship or some level of assistance in the NGO charity-led aged-care sector. I acknowledge Mike Farrell, who works for me part time and has volunteered in aged care, something that I know many young Australians do as a way to connect with older Australians and gain their wisdom and experiences. Again, that's why we need to make sure, when we're talking about how we look after those older Australians, that we have the capacity to learn from them and that we have the capacity for them to have the comfort to be able to share experiences in the last years of their life and not be scared, worried or indeed mistreated when they are in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale of the royal commission is also something that I think should not be lost on this place. The royal commission received 10,500 public submissions, many of which drew on the 22 expert reports that came before. And now we've got a Prime Minister who fails to listen to his own royal commission. We know that the royal commission response was sort of dropped out when the Prime Minister was having a couple of politically difficult days. There wasn't time for the media to properly analyse the report before it was released and the Prime Minister stood up to take questions. But, as we've seen as we start to dissect this report, as we start to pull it apart, not only does it not have anything for the aged-care workforce; it expects aged-care workers to deliver more for less, hoping that somehow this will improve the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a recommendation from the royal commission that nurses be on duty 24/7 in residential care. We still don't have a comprehensive response from the government about that problem. We still have, despite the announcements in the budget, 100,000 Australians on the home-care waitlist, waiting for their chance to get the care and support they need in their homes, and they live in our communities across Australia. We should also make sure that where we can, where it's effective for the individuals, where it's effective for the government, people can stay in their own home, can stay living in their community, because that also means they contribute so much more to their community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude my remarks, I just want to say that Australia does have a proud record on health. It's not surprising that Australia, with a universal public health system, ranks very high in life expectancy. An Australian can expect to live to 82.8 years, well above the OECD average. But, if we fail to invest in aged care, where people need it most, if we fail to listen to the royal commission and, at the same time, if we start dismantling the proper universality of that public health system, we're actually just going to compound these problems for the future, leaving people with worse health outcomes at retirement, worse health outcomes when they do enter the aged-care system. That will put more pressure on our hospitals and leave older Australians financially worse off in the last years of their life. I will conclude my remarks there.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  One hundred and twelve days after the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety report was handed down this is the first—and small—step that we have seen from the Morrison government towards fixing our broken private aged-care system. The Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 implements an urgent recommendation made by the royal commission to prevent the use of restraints and restrictive practices in aged care except for in the most extreme cases and only as a last resort. But you wouldn't know that this recommendation and its implementation were urgent based on how the Morrison government has prioritised it. Since this bill was first tabled on 27 May, it has been pushed back seven times. This bill has sat there collecting dust while older Australians continue to be abused and neglected every single day in our private aged-care system. What could be more urgent than protecting the health and wellbeing of older Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many people experience the aged-care system as uncaring, unkind and even inhumane in its response to their basic needs. As I mentioned, this bill seeks to prevent the use of restraints and restrictive practices in aged care except for in the most extreme cases, because the royal commission specifically heard about the excessive use of physical and chemical restraints in residential aged care, which robs older Australians of their dignity and of their autonomy in their final months. Older people with mental health issues, particularly those suffering from the later stages of dementia, are often heavily medicated or physically restrained. In the final three months of 2019-20, residential aged-care services made 24,681 reports of intent to restrain and 62,800 reports of physical restraint devices. Frail older Australians whose hard work created the country that we love are being treated inhumanely. They are being neglected and they are being malnourished in a widespread scale across the country. And, when they turn to this federal government for help, they are being told to wait years and years for the services that they desperately need. It isn't good enough, and I will not stand by and watch this Morrison government pat itself on the back for doing the absolute arguable bear minimum after eight long years of doing absolutely nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care crisis has not been created in a vacuum and it hasn't appeared out of nowhere; it has taken eight long years of policy decisions that prioritise profits over people. The Treasurer announced $3.5 billion a year for aged care, and, as a flashy headline, that sounds good; but, as always, the devil is in the detail, and this falls desperately short of what senior Australians actually need. It's just one-third. That funding commitment is only one-third of what the royal commission into aged care found had been cut by this government over the last five years. It's less than half of the funding boost that was recommended by the royal commission. Why have a royal commission if you aren't going to implement the recommendations? We've had 19 reports commissioned since 1997 to investigate the problems in our aged-care system, 11 of which have been commissioned while Scott Morrison was the Treasurer or has been the PM. Apparently this latest report is the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to effect change, and yet somehow they've managed to provide only the bare minimum—and they've pushed back the bare minimum seven times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission report recommendations have not been actioned. This budget doesn't include any immediate funding to solve the malnutrition crisis. It does not guarantee a nurse in every facility around the clock. It does not clear the home-care package waitlist, despite the fact that 26,000 people have died while on that aged-care waitlist over the past two years. They died waiting for a home-care package. Australia still lacks a detailed plan to value and to pay aged-care workers or a plan to deal with the huge recruitment and retention challenges that this sector has ahead of it. There are no strong accountability or transparency safeguards to stop price gouging or money being wasted on management fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last federal budget, the Morrison government handed over $3 billion to private aged-care providers with no strings attached. There is no requirement that this money is tied to improving care, or even to providing food. There is no guarantee that these funds will even be used to implement the recommendations put forward by the royal commission. We need to demand that providers prove that the $13 billion they receive every year from taxpayers isn't just going to shareholders, isn't just going to management bonuses, but is actually going to the older Australians that they are duty-bound to provide for. We should start by stipulating that public funds given to private aged-care providers are conditional upon minimum staffing ratios being introduced to all facilities. Or we could demand that providers prove public funds are being spent to improve the wages of the overstretched, undervalued aged-care workers in our country. We could demand that the private aged-care facilities prove that public funds are being used to improve care or to provide better food. I'm not plucking these ideas out of thin air; these are recommendations that I have heard from aged-care workers who work in my community on the north side of Brisbane. They are also recommendations that were provided by the commissioners of the royal commission itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact of the matter is that you cannot fix a private aged-care system whilst aged-care workers are underpaid and overworked. It is impossible to argue that the work aged-care workers undertake—caring for our most vulnerable, bathing them, assisting them with movement, helping keep them up with their hygiene needs—is even remotely commensurate with the wages that they receive at the moment. An entry-level aged-care worker is paid $21.09 an hour under the award, less than someone stacking shelves at a supermarket. But the real outrage is further up the skills scale. If we look at aged-care workers who have reached classification 4, the award provides roughly $15 an hour less than their equivalent in disability—and disability workers aren't exactly on the best wicket either. Even a nurse with the exact same qualifications is paid less to work in aged care than they would get in a hospital setting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently spoke to an aged-care worker from Queensland who told me she thinks she has had one pay rise in the last seven years, and that pay rise was 25c an hour. What an insult! Aged-care jobs should be good jobs. They should be properly paid. Aged-care jobs should give workers financial independence. Their conditions shouldn't just be tolerable; they should be desirable. Aged-care workers love their residents, our family members; they just want to care for people. But providers depend on that compassion, and some of them exploit it. Love doesn't pay the rent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently spoke to another aged-care worker who works for a major home-care provider. Her workday starts at 6 am and finishes at 10 pm. She is expected to pay for her own work travel costs because her boss refuses to pay. She doesn't get paid for travel time, but can be expected to drive up to an hour to see a client. She's not paid for that time spent on the road. And when she clocks off, she goes back to her office to do paperwork. And possibly the biggest kick in the guts is that she has a minimum of 15 contact hours per week. How can anyone expect to pay their bills based on 15 hours of work per week? When I asked her what she thought of this Morrison government federal budget response, she said, 'Too little, too late.' The budget increased care hours, but we have to wait over two years for care hours to come in. We can't wait that long. The sector is in crisis now, and 'crisis' means it's a problem that needs to be fixed now, not in two years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care is a bigger employer than mining in Australia. When we put aged care in with health, disability and social services, it is the biggest employing sector in Australia without question. It is only going to get bigger. The Productivity Commission has told us that we need roughly 7,000 more aged-care workers in the sector in the next 30 years. We need to properly invest in the aged-care workforce now, because our reliance on these workers is only going to grow as our population continues to age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have three days left of parliament before we begin the winter break and go back to our electorates to work in our communities. I challenge the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer to use this time to reflect on their priorities and to create a real plan to actually fix this mess.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  When you stand for office in this country you have to stand for office on the assumption in this place, if you're one of the major parties of government, that you might win government. Well, those opposite did. Eight long years ago, they won government. I came into this parliament in 2013 on their win, and one of the first things I did as the member for Lalor was visit one of my local aged-care facilities after the 2014 budget to hear about the cuts that this government made to the aged-care sector, cuts that meant that a local facility in my area was incredibly concerned that people with severe dementia were not going to get the quality of care that they required, their neighbouring residents required or the staff required, and that has been the story of this government. Their first act in aged care was a cut to the most vulnerable, our elderly, and, more precisely, it was a cut to our most vulnerable, those who are suffering from severe dementia. That's an extraordinary thing for those opposite to choose to do when they gained the privilege of government, and nothing has changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're here tonight debating the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021—a piece of legislation that provides too little too late, that is supposedly in response to a royal commission called by those opposite after 22 other reports said that our aged-care system in this country was in crisis. There are 148 recommendations from the royal commission. But let's not forget the title of the interim report that came down during the COVID pandemic. The title was <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. The story of our aged-care system was neglect, and tonight we're here talking about a piece of legislation that does the bare minimum to improve that state of affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're looking at money going into aged care, but the biggest thing, the most distinct thing, that came out of the royal commission was the notion that we needed transparency about the spend, the notion that accountability would be built in if we had transparency. But what does this government do? This government then makes a monetary commitment with no accountability, with no transparency. That's $3.2 billion with no strings attached to ensure this goes to actual care or better food rather than management bonuses or a new office fit-out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes me back to the middle of the pandemic, and, as we heard the member for Lilley say, aged-care workers work on $21.09 an hour. In light of this government's original cut in that budget, I went and met with aged-care workers in Victoria. It was one of the most compelling things I've ever attended. I listened to the aged-care workers who were sitting beside me, telling me, in tears, what the election of this government had meant for their workplaces. They said it had meant they couldn't sit with someone when they delivered a cup of tea anymore and that it was breaking their hearts because they had known some of these residents for years. They said it was a pattern of behaviour that was no longer afforded in the aged-care centres where they were working, and so they had to say to our elderly citizens, people's parents: 'Here's your cup of tea. Sorry; there's no time to chat. I've got to go and deliver the next cup of tea.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the stories that the royal commission heard, and worse—we've heard ad infinitum the references to maggots—but it's not just those graphic stories that speak of the neglect. It's the bedsores and the other things when families find out about the living conditions of their aged parents in aged care—things that are completely and utterly avoidable and that this government has an opportunity to fix right now, as I stand here tonight. But it chooses not to. It chooses not to build in accountability and transparency. It chooses not to ensure that staffing ratios work to support residents and provide care. It chooses not to insist upon a resident nurse 24 hours a day, as recommended by the royal commission. Nothing should surprise us in this space. Really, seriously, nothing should surprise us. The reason it shouldn't surprise us is that during the pandemic we saw this government's attitude to aged care writ large. Everything that happened in aged care last winter is indicative of where we are now with a government not prepared to embrace transparency in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just go through that a little. This government and the minister responsible for aged care last winter failed to protect our elderly during the pandemic, and they are still failing. There were a litany of errors. Funding was provided for PPE but without an audit to see if it was spent. Even after the tragedies in New South Wales, I couldn't be told whether or not each facility in my electorate of Lalor had purchased the required PPE, because there was no audit, no closing of the loop so the government had assurance that the money provided by it was used appropriately for PPE. So we entered the winter in Melbourne, and in my community absolute disaster followed. When we asked Minister Colbeck, he claimed that the staff had all been trained. Well, if they'd all been trained, you would have thought that the infection rate would be under control fairly quickly, and that wasn't the case. That wasn't the case in every aged-care centre in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last winter in the electorate of Lalor there were 472 confirmed COVID cases linked directly to aged care. Of those, there were 220 staff members infected. There were 192 residents infected. There were 60 in a bracket called 'other', whom I assume were the families of aged-care workers who took COVID home. Last winter I watched aged-care workers change their clothes behind their car in a public street before they went home. That was in Australia in 2020. Most sadly, there were 67 deaths in aged care in my electorate last winter. They were 67 deaths that could have been avoided if this government had taken the pandemic seriously enough to ensure that the aged-care sector was prepared, trained and provided with the appropriate equipment; if it had ensured that people weren't working in more than one facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all that has happened, we had to walk into this place in the last sitting week and remind the government that they had lifted the requirement that aged-care workers not work in more than one facility. There has been a litany of failures from the government, and tonight's legislation just adds to those failures, because the government refuse to understand that transparency is the key to improvement. They've absolutely refused to understand that and it was with tragic circumstances in my electorate. What happened in my electorate is indicative of the way this government sees aged care and their refusal to accept the federal responsibility, because let's not forget last winter they didn't want to accept responsibility for aged care. They kept suggesting that it was somebody else's fault. We had over 680 residents die in aged care. We had a minister who didn't know the number of cases and deaths in aged care at Senate estimates in August. He said he didn't feel personally responsible for the deaths. He said he didn't know how many aged-care workers were vaccinated in June this year. They haven't learnt any lessons about what the pandemic should have taught us about aged care, but they haven't learnt any lessons from the royal commission either. They're coming into this place to bring in legislation that does not do enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This one's personal for most of us in the House. I can stand here and tell you that my mum's 93 and she's still living at home. Fortunately she's still independent. She recovered from a broken hip last year in the middle of the pandemic and is back to her bright self at home. She has seven surviving children but the highlight of her week is the visit from her home-care support because that person has become a real friend to my mum. Outside of the family that's probably the person she relies on the most to walk through the door. I'm telling you that person is not paid enough to look after my mum. My mum deserves better and so does the carer who comes and so diligently and carefully, with affection and love, showers her and assists her to dress three times a week. That is gold. That is so much more than 21 bucks an hour. You've got to be kidding in this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  It's right that we're here again talking about aged care, because this has been one of the signature issues that has faced the government. At every turn they have failed to take adequate steps to address the real challenges that are facing residents in aged care and the staff who work in aged care. I talked to my community about this because they know that there is a crisis. The workers are telling me how hard their jobs are, the family members with someone in aged care are telling me and when I go into aged-care facilities often it's the residents who are telling me that things just aren't good enough. But they haven't felt that they had a voice. It was only thanks to a royal commission that anyone felt they had a voice to use in this situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in the broader community often say to me: 'But this is a problem caused by governments over multiple decades. This has been building up.' I say, 'No. I was around in 2010 as a candidate and I vividly remember running aged-care forums in my community in 2010 and then 2013 in the lead-up to the 2013 election. Mark Butler was the minister of aged care then. He came out and spoke to people. There was no sense of crisis. There was absolutely a sense that things needed to evolve and things needed to change, but I didn't have family members telling me how much they worry about the food that their family member is being given or the lack of attention and care that they're receiving in a particular facility, anywhere near the scale that I've been hearing since being a member of parliament for the last five years and for the years since 2013.' There's clearly been a decline, a really significant decline, and it sits squarely at the feet of this government, of successive Liberal governments. Every time there's an opportunity to take action that isn't embraced by the other side. It's an incremental response. 'Let's just do a little bit and see if we can get away with doing a little bit,' and that's how this legislation feels to me. The neglect that older Australians and the aged-care system have suffered is not being addressed by this piece of legislation. This is not fundamentally going to change. I note that this bill is the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. Well, I want to know where No. 2 is. And, if they're as small as this, we're going to need No. 3, No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6; we will need a lot of these for this to be considered any sort of meaningful response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister somehow tries to make out that aged care is really not something he needs to worry about. We saw that during COVID at its height last year, with the onslaught aged-care facilities were facing, the fear that was around and the absolute failure by the government to take responsibility for keeping residents in aged-care facilities safe and keeping staff safe. We eventually managed to get the government to bring in some rules around staff being able to work in only one facility due to COVID. I have to say, I was shocked that that rule was quietly dropped; it just disappeared. We only found that out when we had another serious outbreak. It is just extraordinary behaviour. It's kind of like the people who slow down on the roads when the policeman's watching but speed up again as soon as the policeman's attention is diverted elsewhere. In both those situations, that costs lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The delay in responding to the royal commission is one thing, but in the lead-up to the royal commission there were 22 other reports about aged care which pretty much mapped the sorts of things that could be done. At every step this government failed to put forward a plan. Even this is not a plan to reform the sector. This is not what people were expecting to see. It is absolutely tiny steps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to highlight some of the gaps that I see that remain. One of the No. 1 gaps is workforce. Nothing is going to change without fundamental reform to the workforce. Some people are earning less than they would earn if they were feeding animals at the zoo. Their base pay is so low, and that says everything about what those opposite think in terms of the quality of workers and the importance of the care that they're delivering. The workers I know—and I know them because I go into aged care; sometimes it's to visit my father—are run off their feet, but they're incredibly caring. I often see people just about to leave a shift—they've probably worked longer than their shift was meant to be, anyway—and, as they're walking out with their coat on one arm and a bag of supplies they had for the day, they hear a voice from a room saying: 'Can someone help? I need to go to the toilet', or they hear a call out from someone in a bed. Do you know what they do? They just drop their stuff, put it on the ground, and go and see what they can do to make that person more comfortable. These are the sorts of people we are talking about—incredible people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the government has failed to do anything to improve the wages for those overstretched and undervalued workers is something else that says everything about what those opposite are like. They're very happy to give $3.2 billion of funds to providers with no strings attached—no genuine transparency about how it's going to be spent, just hoping that it's going to go to actual care or better food. The accountability built into this bill is so broad and loose. It's one of the big failings in this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The home-care waitlist is more than an embarrassment; it's a shame. It's a shame on this whole nation that people are at home waiting for a home-care package that they have been approved for. They have been assessed and someone has talked to them. Do you know how hard those conversations are when you've got a husband and a wife who have to sit there and say, 'We can't do this on our own anymore'? These are people who live in their home and are married. In my parents' case, they have been married for decades, yet my mother has to say, 'I can't look after my husband anymore on my own.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do those opposite ever think about what that feels like, even to get to that point of asking for help in the home? Then you may be assessed and told you're eligible for a high-level care package but there's a catch: there isn't one available and there'll only be one available when someone dies and frees it up. These are the people who we should be treating with the utmost respect and dignity, but we humiliate them unnecessarily. That's one of the things that we should be trying to change fundamentally with these reforms. When there's a royal commission which just says 'neglect', underneath that is a lack of respect and a lack of dignity. Those are the sorts of things that we should be absolutely busting a gut to improve. The Home Care Package waiting list is going to continue to be a real stain on this nation because we're letting people be in their homes without the appropriate supports that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure to put a nurse on duty 24/7 in a residential facility is also unbelievable—how can people not see how vital that is? It's a core thing to improving the quality of care. And then there's not looking seriously at more generous hours for carers and nurses to spend with residents. COVID has been hard and there are so many lonely people in aged care. I'm locked out at the moment because I've had COVID shots and so I have to wait to get my flu shot, which I will be able to do, but I just have that feeling that I can't even pop in and see my dad and help to alleviate the boredom of his day. It has been hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we have incredible staff. We need to keep them in the system and we need to upskill them. We need to make them feel proud of what they do because they're not feeling overstretched and overworked—that they can actually have a balance in their life and that maybe they only need to work at one facility because they get paid appropriately. These are the things that Labor wants to fix. I've looked at this government and at the way it has treated aged care for the last eight years and I know that Labor can do better.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. It was Scott Morrison, the current Prime Minister, who cut aged care by $1.7 billion when he was Treasurer. And in this recent budget the government spent, spent and spent to paper over their political problems ahead of the upcoming election. They spent to cover their political tracks, not to invest in aged care or to enact fully the much-needed reforms and recommendations from the royal commission. This is an aged-care crisis which we see playing out before us. It's a system that's in crisis. It has been let down by years of coalition cuts and mismanagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen again in recent weeks that, due to the embarrassingly low wages and number of hours on offer, workers are compelled to work in multiple care homes. In November last year, the Morrison government returned to a position of allowing workers to work in multiple homes. They made that decision after it was suspended for a period of time because of the pandemic. Once again, they were shirking their responsibilities and not thinking through the consequences. From the very early days of the pandemic last year, we saw the horrifying scenes in countries across the world. In many countries the elderly bore the brunt of the deadly virus. There were horrible pictures from Italy, Spain and other countries. In April last year, in Sydney—in our country—the Newmarch House outbreak took the lives of more than a dozen residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this; we saw it play out before us and we can't say that we weren't warned. The government should have learnt from this, yet the coalition government dragged their feet in taking the steps necessary in the aged-care facilities, which are under their jurisdiction. They didn't order enough PPE, they didn't help aged-care facilities to prepare or give them practical advice on infection control. They didn't mandate commonsense controls, like limits on workers working across multiple homes, and they didn't put in mask mandates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Wills, the St Basil's aged-care facility saw 183 coronavirus cases and 44 deaths—44 deaths in one aged-care facility—and there were more than 650 aged-care deaths in total during Victoria's second wave. Aged care is a federal responsibility—we know that. The majority of the deaths that occurred occurred in private aged-care centres, which are under the responsibility of the federal government. At the height of Victoria's second wave there were 1,923 cases in private facilities; in the public aged-care facilities, the Victorian state government run facilities, there were six.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than a year on, the federal government have botched the vaccine rollout, and aged-care residents are still at risk. How is this possible? It's been more than three months since our vaccine rollout started, yet only 3.3 per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated against this deadly virus. In the United States they are offering the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to anyone over the age of 12. In the UK, I think some 59 per cent of UK citizens are fully vaccinated. And here we are struggling to get the vaccine to people who are in their 80s and their 90s. We're still struggling to get the vaccine to people who work within aged care. We're still struggling to get the vaccine to frontline workers in health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister responsible was forced to admit that he has no idea how many aged-care workers have been vaccinated. He couldn't get that number. With all the power of the government departments under his control he couldn't get that number. Well, it turns out that less than 10 per cent of employees have been fully vaccinated—and it was actually left to Victoria to do a five-day blitz to vaccinate healthcare workers. Yet the minister says that he's comfortable about how the rollout is going. That is what he said in Senate estimates—he's comfortable about how the rollout is going. Where there is no comfort for the families who are grieving, the minister is comfortable—because this government and its ministers won't take responsibility. They won't show leadership. They can't demonstrate real leadership, when the country so desperately needs them to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's is easy to be distracted by numbers and statistics, but it's important that we remember that in each aged-care facility across this country there are people that we have a responsibility to look after. They are our friends, our mothers, our fathers and our grandparents. One of my constituents, Patrick, contacted my office just last week. His mother resides in a private aged-care facility regulated by the federal government. His mother has dementia and, despite her agreeing to receive the vaccine, on the actual day when they came to give her the vaccine she was confused and, in her confusion, declined the jab. She didn't understand what she was being told. When Patrick found out, he was told that she would be given her first dose when vaccine administrators came back in a few weeks with the second dose. Yet on that day they didn't even try to give her the first dose. Patrick is now having to go through this bureaucratic nightmare just to get his elderly mother vaccinated, and it's been an uphill battle. The government's advice to Patrick was that he try to get her to a GP or get a GP to come out to the facility or for her to go to one of the hubs at the Exhibition Centre to get the shot. Can you imagine an elderly woman with dementia trying to navigate the Exhibition Centre in Melbourne? Is that really the best we can do? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A future Labor government will actually deliver the care that is worthy of elderly Australians—the people who built this country; the people whose shoulders we stand on. We'll do this by ensuring that every dollar spent in aged care goes towards employing a guaranteed minimum level of nurses, assistants and carers and towards daily needs like decent food, rather than lining the pockets of the more unscrupulous providers. We will also take the steps necessary to make sure that the aged-care sector is properly funded and is investing for the long term as our population ages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;" />Providing the best care possible to our elderly shouldn't be controversial, yet it is. On this side of House we believe in properly funding our aged-care system. On this side of the House we believe in keeping our elderly Australians and most vulnerable people safe. On this side of the House we believe in investing in the long term to ensure <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">all Australians know </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">that </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">they will be able to retire and grow old safely</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">,</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> comfortably and </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">with</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> dignity. Based on all the evidence that we have seen over the past 14 months, as we look past all the PR spin and bluster from the Morrison government and his ministers, I don't think I can say the same for the coalition.</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for Cooper, noting the systemic, ongoing failures in Australia's aged-care system, as evidenced by the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, including, but not limited to, the use of restrictive practices and restraints in aged care; the inadequacy of the government's response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, including delayed and diminished legislative action on key issues and recommendations; and the government's failures in protecting aged-care residents and workers due to their poor management of COVID-19 outbreaks in residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, but the truth is that this government has neglected older Australians, and the aged-care system meant to support them, for eight long years. The reality is that this Prime Minister doesn't want to take responsibility for a problem largely of his own making—from cuts he made as Treasurer. Remember this is the Prime Minister who failed to listen to Australians living in residential aged care and their concerned families, who failed to listen to workers traumatised by systemic failures, who failed to listen to 22 expert reports and who only announced the royal commission just before an ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> investigation, which used hidden cameras to reveal abuse and harm to older Australians in aged care, was screened. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to the royal commission and the crisis in aged care is just not good enough. They've dodged, delayed or outright rejected key recommendations. Nothing will change without reforms to the workforce. There was nothing to improve wages for overstretched, undervalued aged-care workers. The government is failing to collaborate with employee organisations, despite the royal commission's recommendation to do so. At the same time, they're gifting $3.2 billion to providers, with no conditions to make sure this goes to actual care or better food, not just improving their bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have today, I'd like to turn to schedule 1, an amendment to the Aged Care Act and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act to further strengthen legislation on the use of restrictive practices, including chemical restraint. Some of the most alarming evidence to the royal commission related to the widespread sedation or chemical restraint of aged-care residents, often with dementia. Evidence from Associate Professor Juanita Breen from Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre at the University of Tasmania, in a study of 11,500 residents in 139 aged-care homes, found that 22 per cent of aged-care residents were taking antipsychotics, 41 per cent were taking antidepressants and 22 per cent were taking benzodiazepines on a regular basis, largely daily. As a pharmacist who worked in mental health and psychogeriatrics, and having lost my father to younger-onset Alzheimer's dementia, this is of concern to me and to countless individuals and families across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's interim report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span> found that the use of antipsychotics was not clearly justified in 90 per cent of cases in which they were prescribed and that polypharmacy and chemical restraint have been the norm. Sadly, this robs people of time, like the case of a beloved wife who spent the last month of her husband's life trying to wean him off drugs, who felt the sedating effects of these drugs robbed her of precious time with her husband. As the PSA's <span style="font-style:italic;">Medicine safety: aged care</span> report found, more than 95 per cent of aged-care residents had at least one problem with their medicines, and most had three, including dangerous drug interactions and overdosing; 50 per cent of people with dementia were taking medicines with anticholinergic properties, which can worsen symptoms such as confusion; and one-fifth were on antipsychotics, with more than half using the medicine for too long. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final three months of 2019-20, residential aged-care services made 24,681 reports of intent to restrain. As Associate Professor Chris Freeman said, 'Inappropriate chemical restraint and polypharmacy leading to sedation, falls and avoidable hospitalisation are some of the biggest problems in aged care.' Yet the government has failed to act properly, leaving vulnerable older Australians at risk. On this I'll finish with the words of Dr Andrew Stafford, an aged-care and dementia specialist pharmacist and academic at Curtin University. He said: 'While welcoming the budget measures, it doesn't go far enough to reduce the risk of preventable medicines related harm for people living in residential care, particularly those with dementia.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left I'd like to share the experiences of some local people in my community. In a community where one in five people are aged over 65, aged care is something that matters. It matters to everybody, like Frank who writes to me: 'Every baby boomer we know dreads the thought of having to go into a nursing home. Just look back at the issues uncovered by the royal commission and, more recently, the shocking handling of infection control with COVID-19.' He goes on: 'We have all had experience with parents and relatives experiencing substandard care in nursing homes, so absolutely everyone plans to stay home as long as possible. Of course, this means that the current problems with privately owned nursing homes will only continue to worsen as we all age.' He says: 'What all this is leading to is that it seems to me that ageing at home with support is the best and most logical solution. It's the option we plan to take, if we can.' As of December 2020 there were 1,057 people living on the Central Coast waiting for a home-care package. Across Australia there were some 97,000 people waiting for a package, and I'm aware of people who've been waiting for 18 months for a home-care package. The government has announced 40,000 additional packages this financial year and the next, and this is of course welcome. But it won't clear the waiting list while more people join the end of the queue. Older Australians shouldn't have to wait for the care they so desperately need, leaving them and their loved ones at risk and vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm often contacted by people at the end of their tether waiting for packages for themselves or loved ones. Dianne of Tumbi Umbi wrote to me: 'I've been waiting quite a few months now. I've been granted a level 3 package and in the interim I've been granted a level 2 package, but I've not received either. My husband has deteriorated immensely over the last couple of months, and I'm needing further help as I am slowly going crazy. At present I receive three hours a week.' Jennifer of Long Jetty told me she's the carer of her 94-year-old mother. She's 68 herself, and her mum's on a level 1 package. She's been waiting since February to be upgraded, and Jennifer is concerned that the level 1 package will not give her mother enough support while she herself is in hospital having surgery. Roger, who is 84, was assessed for a level 3 package 18 months ago, which he has not received. He's been paying for the services he needs out of his own pocket and now has a debt to his provider. Carol, who is 82, applied for a package in late 2019 and was assessed the following year. She was assessed at a level 2 package but was told there'd be a nine- to 12-month wait. In May of this year she was advised that she was still looking at a nine- to 12-month wait. Then there's Margaret, 77, of Wyoming. Margaret and her husband were assessed for a level 2 package 18 months to two years ago and haven't had any service since then. Older Australians and those who love them deserve better. The government has to do more. It's urgent and they have to act now.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 and I want to speak today about Beryl and Quentin. Beryl wrote to me just last month. She lives in my electorate of Paterson along with her husband, Quentin. She wrote outlining her long list of concerns about the lack of care her husband, Quentin, was receiving during his stay in aged care. Sadly, Quentin has been diagnosed with early-onset dementia. This has resulted in him losing most of his cognitive functions in communicating and comprehending conversation. He struggles to understand what's being said to him and around him and he struggles to let others know what he needs and what he has to do himself. Beryl has said that her husband has experienced a significant lack of care regarding showering and general hygiene. Quentin wasn't even being provided with hot water when being showered. Can you imagine someone who's confused and not sure what's happening being showered with cold water? The mind just boggles. At times he was left to sleep in soiled sheets. How distressing for him and for Beryl, who has found him in this situation more than once. Quentin has multiple health checks that have been neglected and therefore his cholesterol has risen dramatically over the last six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad reality is that stories like Quentin's and Beryl's are all too familiar, because some aged-care facilities aren't being adequately funded or properly and competently managed. Beryl has shared her story and Quentin's story with me in the hope that our Prime Minister will actually hear what is being said and will act on stories like these. I don't think that this is a failure to listen by those opposite. I think they're hearing what's happening—how can they not?—but the issue is they're not acting. They are not acting, and these people need action from their government. That is one of the principles of winning government, of having the privilege of governing. People vote for you. They vote for you under the assumption that you will act once you are the government, not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to their plight. And that's why we need action from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inadequacies of the Morrison government in responding to the royal commission into aged care—look, they really are quite appalling. There's no sensible-thinking Australian who would say: 'There's nothing more to be done for this. We're thinking about what we can do, but we're just not there at the moment.' Surely we have heard enough horror stories. Surely we don't have to hear any more before this government will take appropriate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been three months since the final report from the royal commission was handed down. The sector is no better off; there has been no road map to suggest how we are going to improve this really diabolical situation. And consider this: we live in a First World country, where ageing should be something that is celebrated, where people should be confident that the people they love will be competently cared for. God forbid you could consider increasing staff or wages for hardworking carers! The figure of $21 an hour really is an insult to those people who are far more than just carers. They are pseudo nurses; they are often pseudo doctors; they are certainly pseudo psychologists; pharmacists—they are doing everything that is being asked of them in these aged-care facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just about not being paid adequately; this is also about respect. These people are often the salt of the earth, and they're the people with the biggest hearts in our community. They don't do their job because it pays $21 an hour, let me assure you of that. They do it because they have an overarching sense of purpose. Of course they need to put food on their tables, but they do it because someone has to, and they want to. They want to be there when that frail hand reaches out. They want to be there to give that touch and give that love back to that person. At least that's what most of the people who work in aged care have described to me. It's far bigger than just a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to this Prime Minister: action speaks louder than any other thing that you can do. We know that the royal commission graphically highlighted the tragic outcomes for and neglect of older Australians. Two-thirds of residents were found to be malnourished or at the risk of malnourishment. And, as my colleague the member for Dobell, a qualified pharmacist, has outlined most graphically today, the use of medication as a chemical restraint is shocking and abhorrent. It cannot be the case that we are just doping up our elderly Australians to keep them sedated and quiet in homes. That cannot be their existence in the latter years of their lives. We cannot accept this for any Australians, let alone those who—we rightly say—have paid their taxes and paid their dues to their country. Surely we are better than this here in Australia. This government has failed to listen. It has failed to listen to 22 experts, and now even its own royal commission. It's like we are in some sort of twilight zone here. I have to pinch myself when I think about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hardest decision a family member can make is to move a loved one into permanent residential care. I know that there are many people across Australia who battle with that decision. We all want to die peacefully in our sleep in our own home at a ripe old age, surrounded by people who love us. That's the dream. But so few people in Australia get to have that dream. Many more should be able to, but we know that, if they're in a nursing home where there's not adequate staff and that's not being managed properly and they're being medically and chemically restrained—what sort of an existence is that for someone?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the hardest decision a family member will make is to put someone into care, and I know that personally. Just this last weekend I've had to have the conversation with my sisters and my mother about her leaving our family home, a place where my family has resided for generations, and going to a home, and it is absolutely devastating. People don't want it to happen, but it does happen, so we have to make sure that, if your life, after a well-lived life, is about to be reduced to a room about the size of a cupboard in a nursing home, those final years are the richest, safest, most social and best that you can have. If that's what has to happen for you or if you choose to do that, it should be a terrific experience—for all Australians. We here in this place have been charged with that, and I again appeal to the Prime Minister, to this government, to the aged-care minister: liven up, become active about this, get actions into place, give our elderly Australians the absolute best twilight years of their lives so that we can proudly know that we have done our utmost for them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  Our aged-care system is in crisis because of this Liberal-National government, and its response to the aged care royal commission is far, far from enough. In fact, it really is a complete disgrace. In fact, the government itself is in crisis. We've seen this today, and, instead of focusing on the really big issues across the country, like its bungled vaccine rollout or its lack of quarantine facilities, its completely consumed with itself. We're seeing crisis after crisis from this government, particularly when it comes to aged care. The government's response to aged care really falls well short of what was required and fails to deliver on the long-term reforms that are needed in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They created this crisis through their ongoing funding cuts and their lack of will and capacity to address problems within the sector. This crisis, when it comes to our senior Australians, is part of the government's overall failure, whether it's their pension cuts or their failure to invest in aged care. Time and time again, our senior Australians know they just cannot trust this government when it comes to accessing the services or the health care or the aged care that they might need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were all equally horrified by some of the reports that we saw in the royal commission. Some of those stories of maltreatment and substandard care were truly distressing. Some of the really graphic stories we heard, very tragic ones, include things like neglect, including maggots in the wounds of residents. This is disgusting! We heard that two-thirds of residents were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. It is appalling that these older Australians in our nursing homes are being treated this way or are at risk of such horrific treatment. The stories were incredibly distressing right across the board. But make no mistake: this situation is a direct result of the Morrison government's severe funding cuts to aged care. That's why the situation is so bad. They have chronically underfunded aged care; they cut billions from aged care over the past eight years. The Liberal-National government, with the various prime ministers and deputy prime ministers throughout that time, have consistently cut funding to aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see a lack of funding when it comes to home care as well. We know there are over 100,000 Australians waiting for home-care packages. With the very large proportion of seniors in my electorate, every day I hear from locals who are unable to access home-care packages or the sufficient package that they require to stay in their homes. Of course our older Australians, like everybody else, want to remain in their home for as long as they can, but they can't do that unless they've got a home-care package tailored to their needs, and so many of them are waiting sometimes up to two or three years. This is just appalling—the situations we hear about day by day of older people who are unable to stay in their homes because of this government's funding cuts—and it keeps getting worse and worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, I totally support the amendment moved by the member for Cooper which notes the systemic ongoing failures in Australia's aged-care system as evidenced by the royal commission, including, but not limited to, the use of restrictive practices and restraints in aged care, the inadequacy of the government's response to the royal commission, and the government's failures in protecting residents and workers due to their poor management during the pandemic and the COVID-19 outbreak. The amendment also calls on the government to explain, as a matter of urgency, its plan to fully vaccinate aged-care residents and workers. What an ongoing debacle that has been! Right throughout the country, we have seen the failure of the vaccine rollout and the constant bungling by this government, but, in terms of the residents and the workers in aged care, it has been horrendous. These people should have been prioritised and vaccinated first. We've seen so many situations where particular nursing homes have had to be locked down because these people are not vaccinated. This government has completely bungled it. When it came to this pandemic, they had two major responsibilities: to roll out the vaccine and have fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities. They've completely failed their government responsibilities. The Prime Minister's responsibility—totally failed it. Of course this Prime Minister is responsible for the aged-care system. He's responsible for the funding cuts, and he is responsible for that terrible neglect that's been identified in the royal commission, yet he fails to take responsibility for that and fix it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does fail to tackle some of the major issues in aged care. The problem is that the government has failed to put forward a comprehensive, overall plan for reform of the sector. They've fobbed off or delayed or outright rejected many of the key recommendations, and there is nothing in this bill that will address desperately needed workplace reform. The people who work in the aged-care sector are incredible people, but they are underpaid, overstretched and overworked. They are not properly paid for the incredible work that they do, and there is nothing in this bill at all to address that. The government has also failed, in this bill, to make sure there's adequate transparency and accountability linked to funding given to aged-care providers. Also, in terms of the introduction of the assurance review, it's disappointing that the government hasn't followed more closely the recommendations from the royal commission to increase transparency and accountability measures. They've failed to clear the home-care package waitlist of over 100,000 people, and they've also ignored the recommendation to require a nurse to be on duty 24/7 in residential care. This is absolutely imperative and is at the heart of improving care. They have ignored that. We know that staffing levels are central to the quality care issues that we've seen in aged care. The government has also failed to do enough in terms of ensuring that there is enough support for those at risk due to the use of restraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, as I have said many times before, we have a duty as a nation to ensure that every Australian is treated with respect and dignity, and we must ensure that they can access public services, health care and aged-care support when they need them. We must always remember that it's our older Australians who built this country, and they need to have better support from this government. It is disgraceful that they've been neglected by the Liberal-National government. We see across the board the government's complete neglect when it comes to our older Australians. Whether it's because of their cuts to pensions, their plans to expand the cashless welfare card or their cuts to aged care, older Australians know this government cannot be trusted at all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="133646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I want to dedicate this speech to an amazing family from my community: Edgard Proy; his father, Silvio; his son, Oscar; and their beloved Monica: mother, grandmother and wife. Edgard is someone I've spoken about before in this place. He fought for his mother to be released from the chemical restraints that an aged-care facility put her in when she and Silvio had to make the hard decision—and Edgard had to be part of that—to go into an aged-care facility. Monica had dementia, and Silvio had suffered a stroke. That aged-care facility put her into chemical restraints in order to 'control her and her behaviour'. Edgard fought for his mother, and he fought for her to be released from those chemical constraints. It took two years to wean her off the medication, with the help of loving and dedicated carers. Edgard then, in 2019, fought for the practice of excessive chemical restraints of people in aged care to end. He bravely told his mother's story and his family's story publicly so that it could be part of the consideration of the aged care royal commission so that others didn't have to go through what Monica went through. Sadly, Edgard and Silvio and Oscar lost their beloved Monica recently, but her legacy lives on. This bill, the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, is proof of that, because this legislation does prevent the overuse of restraints and restrictive practices in aged care, except in the most extreme cases and only as a last resort. That's why I'm very pleased to be supporting this bill put forward by the government and supported by my Labor colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a little bit disappointing that the royal commission's recommendation around the introduction of an independent expert approval for the use of restrictive practices was rejected by the government. I understand their reasons for doing so, but it is a shame. Nonetheless, on behalf of Edgard and his family and everyone who's had a loved one go through what Monica went through, I'm very pleased to support that part of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that there are a lot more problems in the aged-care sector. Some of them stem from underfunding, some of them stem from practices that are more about profit than about care, and some of them stem from systemic undervaluing and a lack of support of the workforce. I recently wrote to my entire community proposing that together we should fix the aged-care system, because aged care affects us, our parents, our grandparents, our friends and our community, and more than half of all Australian women and about a third of Australian men will end up in residential aged care. Sadly, we know that it is the case that over the last eight long years Australians and their families have suffered through an aged-care system which has been in crisis, and this crisis was born significantly from budget cuts and from prioritising competition without regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that there was a royal commission with an interim report that was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. We've all heard about the maggots in wounds and that two-thirds of aged-care residents have been malnourished or at risk of being malnourished. There are key recommendations of the royal commission that have not been accepted by the Morrison government, and I am deeply disappointed by that on behalf of my community, particularly the failure to accept that a registered nurse should be on duty at all times, to increase the wages of nurses and carers, and to implement a comprehensive workforce plan, because the truly amazing and dedicated people that work in aged care are the soul of that system and we must value them more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as many of my colleagues have said, the bungled vaccine rollout put residents and community at risk, and in Victoria we saw the tragic consequences of that and the tragedy of COVID escaping quarantine for so many individuals and families last year. So we do need to fix aged care, we do need to have minimum staffing levels, we do need to have greater transparency about the use of taxpayer funds and we do need to ensure that all residents and staff get the vaccine urgently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in the letter I sent to my community recently, 'Let's fix aged care once and for all.' I asked my community to fill in a survey, and I'll just give this chamber, this parliament, a small flavour of some of the comments that have already come back—I think this survey has been in letterboxes for not much more than 24 hours—'There should be enough fully qualified personnel working in aged-care retirement homes to cater to those in need. It's a basic proposition, and it's a shame on our country that people still think the government needs to hear it.' I've got a constituent whose mother went through 'hell' in an aged-care home. His wife had to complain many times and, in fact, burst into meetings of the staff at that facility in order to try and get something done. I have a constituent who saw an elderly woman tied to a chair in an aged-care home. I have a constituent who has worked in aged care for 20 years and is concerned about the lack of referrals to Dementia Support Australia from aged-care facilities in my community. We know that dementia is the No. 1 killer of women in Australia and the No. 2 killer of people overall. Surely there is more need for the free and available services of Dementia Support Australia. Is the government informing aged-care facilities that the Dementia Support Australia service is there?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a constituent who worked as a PCA in a facility that had run out of adult nappies, and that short time as a student nurse taught my constituent that one day they or their family might be subject to these basic failures. As they wrote to me: 'Aged care needs to be so much more than just money. It needs money, of course it does, but it needs all of the attention and proper regulation to ensure nothing slips through. The elderly aren't useless. They are Australians who have paid their taxes, served their country and it's up to us to protect them at all costs.' I couldn't put it any better than that member of my community, who took the time to write to me: 'The elderly aren't useless. They are Australians who have paid their taxes, served their country and it's up to us to protect them at all costs.' We must do more. We must do better. The Morrison government must urgently do better, and we're not going to stop asking them to do so. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. Of course the Labor Party will support this, but we've moved a second reading amendment because we need to do so much better than this to address the absolute crisis in aged care. This is not just another minor problem, as this government sees it. So often with the government we see that they are just looking for a solution as a political fix. Well, this is a deep, deep crisis. Anyone who has a loved one in aged care knows that, and anyone who has looked at the aged-care royal commission and its recommendations knows that. I want to again acknowledge the people who contributed their stories to the royal commission, because the nation can now clearly see the depth of this crisis—the malnourishment, the neglect, the situations of people with maggots in wounds. People who've had their own experiences with aged care know that these things are not uncommon either. These are not shocking sorts of things that have happened only once in a blue moon. These are very common things. It's not good enough in a country like Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response in this budget commits nowhere near the funding that is needed to address these problems, but also it doesn't go towards tying that funding, through accountability measures, to where it really needs to go. We've seen the government ignore a lot of the recommendations of that royal commission. Why don't we have 24-hour nurses in aged care? This is something that people have been calling for for many years. Anyone who has a loved one in aged care—or, again, anyone who has looked at the recommendations—knows that staffing is key to addressing these issues. The people who work in aged care do it because they have a deep dedication to residents, because they care about the older Australians in their care. When you talk to these workers that is so clear. They front up day after day because they care about these people. What is so devastating is that they can't actually deliver the care in the ways that they would like to because there simply aren't enough people. I saw that firsthand when my grandmother was in aged care. People would come who really, really cared for the elderly people and wanted to spend time making their lives a little bit brighter. But they couldn't even give them the care to ensure that they weren't in these situations of neglect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a response from this government that does nothing to address that, and does nothing to ensure that that money goes where it is most needed. It just goes to the providers like a blank cheque. Some of the providers mean very well, and I want to acknowledge that. I've met with them here in Canberra. Some of them are people who want to create a great place for elderly people to go when they need residential care. But we've also seen people making enormous profits out of aged care while the residents don't even have three decent meals a day. That's not good enough. We could see a policy that would do something about that, but we've not seen that here. I think this quote from the royal commissioner Lynelle Briggs sums this up perfectly and quite shockingly. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At times in this inquiry, it has felt like the Government's main consideration was what was the minimum commitment it could get away with, rather than what should be done to sustain the aged care system so that it is enabled to deliver high quality and safe care. This must change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This must change, and we on this side of the House, as the member for Dunkley has just said, will not stop asking until it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a political problem to be fixed. This is a very human crisis that needs genuine commitment and a genuine solution, so that people in Australia aren't absolutely terrified of the day that they or their loved ones will need to go into aged care. And it's not just residential care; it's people on waiting lists for home care, who can't get the most basic of things to ensure they have dignity and some wellbeing in their older years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill, and we have moved this amendment to ensure that, for the restrictive practices that we've seen abused—and we have seen widespread abuse of these very serious interventions throughout aged care—an actual independent expert oversees them. We also want to see accountability measures introduced. But so much more needs to be done. After eight years of cuts and neglect from this government, more needs to be done and Labor wants to see it happen. We have a plan that, under a Labor government, would see a decent aged-care system, decent child care for young people and a decent Medicare for people in between. We have a plan that actually cares about people, because we on this side of the House actually do care about people. We don't see this as a political fix, and we will keep asking.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I speak today on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. I note that we will be supporting this legislation but also note the second reading amendment moved by the member for Cooper. Obviously, anyone who has had a relative in residential aged care in the last 10 years or so knows that the aged-care system has problems, and in fact arguably was failing long before the royal commission handed down its report. I don't need to remind you, Deputy Speaker, that the title of the interim report was damning. It was a simple title: <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Morrison government are responsible for aged care and we know that they're about to enter their ninth year of government. This broken system is, sadly, one of the Prime Minister's great legacies. As stated by some of the earlier speakers, some of the rot started when he was Treasurer Morrison. We now have an aged-care system that has failed older Australians, those people entrusted to its care, who are some of our most vulnerable Australians. It is a disgrace. I can't understand why that title, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, should not have been motivation for great change instead of incremental distractions. We know the Prime Minister is personally responsible for the devastation in the aged-care system, because, when he was Minister for Social Services and then Treasurer, he was responsible for funding cuts. He is therefore responsible for the neglect identified by the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The entire nation was shocked by the neglect uncovered by those royal commission hearings. It was horrific neglect that included leaving wounds in a state that no civilised nation should accept. There were people with maggots in their wounds. Two-thirds of residents were malnourished or at risk of being malnourished. For eight years, the coalition government have failed to listen to our vulnerable Australians in the aged-care sector. They have failed to listen to families who have raised concerns. They have failed to listen, most importantly, to the workers in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than looking at some of the fine words that have come from those opposite, let's look at what they have actually done, because it amounts to contempt for the workers in the aged-care system. The coalition have failed to listen to 22 expert reports. Now is not the time for kicking the can further down the road. Sadly, now that the royal commission into aged care has handed down its final report, the Morrison government's response shows that it has not listened to the royal commissioners. The facts were horrific, but the coalition's response, at best, aspires to woeful. They have no plan for reform that will improve aged care in the long term, when we have a tsunami of people who will be experiencing dementia and lots of other health issues. They have fobbed off, delayed or outright rejected some of the key recommendations from the commissioners. The aged-care sector will never improve without reform to the workforce. That is a fundamental part of what a good government's response should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's see what the Morrison government haven't done. They have not committed to improving wages for overstretched, undervalued aged-care workers. Aged-care workers are currently being paid less than someone working at McDonald's. Call me old-fashioned, but I still think that giving people money is a sign that they are valued. It's not complicated. Aged-care workers have an incredibly complex job. It's difficult. I've been to some of the aged-care facilities in my own electorate. I'm currently trying to get my 85-year-old father into the aged-care system. I know it's complicated. I know, just from trying to coordinate things with my siblings, that it's incredibly emotional. It's draining on staff to deal with the people in front of them. They're not statistics and they're not case loads; they are people with real-life stories and real-life families. But, for all of that, aged-care workers are still some of the worst-paid workers in the land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it's an enormous responsibility to care for residents in aged care. One registered nurse in an aged-care facility reportedly said: 'People don't go to residential aged care for no reason. They go there because they can't look after themselves. They have chronic issues.' In some aged-care homes, registered nurses arrive for shifts to face the responsibility of looking after more than 100 residents. Just think of physically moving amongst 100 humans and having some meaningful interaction with 100 people in a row. That's not fair to the workers or to the aged-care residents relying on this care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Morrison also ignored the recommendation to increase mandatory care minutes in residential aged care. Staffing levels are central to many of the care quality problems in residential aged care. We know that we're going to need an additional 700,000 workers in aged care by 2050 to cope with our ageing population. There is no way that's achievable when these jobs are disrespected and undervalued by the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does support this bill because it will help prevent the overuse of restraints and restrictive practices in aged care except in the most extreme cases and only as a last resort. I'll mention, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, your other capacity as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. We conducted an inquiry into restrictive practices in aged care. We got some great evidence, and I think some good outcomes flowed from that. But the royal commission concluded that 30 per cent of older people in aged care, almost one in three, had experienced some form of substandard care. They specifically heard about the excessive use of physical and chemical restraints in residential aged care. The use of restraints robs older Australians of their dignity and autonomy, often in their final years or final months. Older Australians suffering dementia are often heavily sedated or physically restrained as a simple management tool, rather than as something that's in their best interests. This bill will help prevent the overuse of restraints, but obviously it's nowhere near the whole answer. When carers are overstretched and undervalued, they can't give the care that residents deserve. They just don't have the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians deserve much more than what is contained in this bill. All Australians deserve a Prime Minister who will listen to the experts and not continually ignore their advice. The royal commission made recommendations that, if implemented, would change the lives of older Australians. In some cases they would save their lives. Sadly, older Australians, their families and hardworking carers can't trust Prime Minister Morrison to fix the broken aged-care system that he started the rot in when he was the minister. Eight years of neglect, nudging into nine—that's what older Australians in aged care are experiencing now. It's not going to be fixed by this bill. Older Australians built this country. They and their families deserve much more than the broken system the Morrison government has created. Aged care impacts all of us. We all expect better than neglect.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. This bill takes a welcome first step towards addressing the very serious recommendations of the royal commission and the independent review of provisions governing the use of restraints in residential aged care. The royal commission and the independent review revealed shocking tales of neglect and abuse in this sector. This bill will address the use of restrictive practices in aged care in alignment with the definition applied under the National Disability Insurance Scheme, bringing care practices in line with the NDIS. The bill also introduces additional scrutiny on home-care packages by creating a role for the secretary of the department to conduct assurance reviews into the delivery and administration of home care. The third measure of this bill abolishes the Aged Care Financing Authority, and the new institutional arrangements have been outlined by the government's response to the royal commission. However, submitters to the Senate inquiry into this bill do seek assurances from the government that there will not be a gap in the reporting on financial reporting of the sector performance in the absence of the ACFA without a replacement as yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Warringah there are 18 residential aged-care facilities. They have responded remarkably to the COVID pandemic, and I commend the staff for their efforts during a most trying time for them and their residents. The staff of the aged-care facilities bore a huge responsibility for keeping residents safe during the pandemic, and I know it was a huge stress on them and their families. Many facilities went for over 300 days without the presentation of a single flu symptom, and there was no known transmission of COVID-19 in Warringah aged-care facilities. Thank you to the residents, their families and the staff of these facilities for your efforts, patience and understanding of the need to keep one another safe during what has been a very difficult 15 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that, in this bill, the government has moved relatively quickly to address the issue highlighted by the royal commission's findings. Restrictive practices involve the use of physical or chemical restraints to control the behaviour of residents in aged-care facilities. The tales and stories were harrowing. The royal commission heard stories and the media reported tales of nursing home residents being turned into zombies and of residents being strapped to a chair for 14 hours in one day. It is horrific to think that that was occurring in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Aged Care Act to make restrictive practices a measure of last resort. Whilst this is good, it is not quite the whole thing that was recommended. Importantly, it requires that the quality-of-care principles limit the circumstances in which a restrictive practice can be used. It should be noted that the Law Council of Australia points out that the definition used in this bill, unlike the definition employed by the royal commission, doesn't define 'restrictive practices' as 'a restriction on a person's ability to make decisions'; rather, it defines it only as 'a restriction on a person's rights'. So there is a concern about that discrepancy. The Law Council is concerned that the definition of the bill may not as clearly apply to the use of chemical restraints as intended by the royal commission, and the explanatory memorandum for the bill doesn't explicitly address the regulation of chemical restraints. I echo the Law Council's call for the bill to be amended and clarified to ensure that 'restrictive practice' is defined to include chemical restraints and to include safeguards specific to the use of such restraints. That was one of the aspects that was most shocking to people—the extent to which chemical restraints have been used. I urge the government and the minister to consider refining the definition of restrictive practices to clarify the responsibility of providers in relation to their use and to require that much greater control be applied to any circumstances of use of restrictive practices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also creates the ability for the secretary to conduct assurance reviews for the purposes of assuring that arrangements for the delivery and administration of home care are effective and efficient. Home-care accountability audits are very important. The Council on the Ageing supports greater oversight of home-care providers and also the increased transparency for consumers through the publishing of such reports on assurance reviews, including any recommendations and conclusions. We need these assurance reviews. Leading Age Services Australia has expressed concern at this clause in the bill, including the lack of definition of the term 'effective and efficient', and the absence of a clear methodology to be employed by the Department of Health. Again, it's really important that, when these bills are put to the parliament, the government and the minister ensure that appropriate definitions for these very important terms are included in the legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing accountability and transparency of the delivery of home-care packages is a welcome step; however, I urge the government to increase the capacity of the home-care sector to eliminate the waitlist for home-care packages. Whilst the additional 80,000 places over two years announced in the budget are very much welcome, there is still more than 100,000 people on the waitlist, and I can't imagine that list getting any shorter with the aging population that we face in this country. The royal commission recommended that the waitlist be cleared by 31 December 2021. At present, there doesn't appear to be a plan in place to clear that list until beyond July 2023. I don't think that is good enough. This is an urgent issue and one that requires immediate attention. Whilst I will always support greater transparency, I also support action, and auditing the performance of providers, rather than rolling out more packages, and slowing down their rollout is not the action that we need right now. It is really important for both of those actions to be taken on board by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 148 recommendations of the royal commission into aged care extend from legislative change to governance, establishment of specialised facilities and care models to improving public awareness of aged care and conditions for workers. It was very extensive. Last month I supported the member for Mayo's motion to establish a parliamentary joint select committee to oversee the implementation of the response to the royal commission. The diversity of issues and the dire need for reform demand ongoing parliamentary scrutiny through a joint select committee. Huge amounts of public funds need to be expended in this sector, and there needs to be the right oversight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the government's response to the royal commission, but I urge them to take on board the need to implement more of the findings of the commissioners and the recommendations within the final report. In particular, I need to draw the government's attention to recommendation 72, which aimed to achieve equity for people with disability receiving aged care. There is currently discrimination against people over 65. In December 2019, I presented a petition of nearly 20,000 signatures which addressed the issue of age discrimination. It was brought to me by the ever-determined Bobbie English, whose husband, Chris, had had an accident at the age of 69, giving him quadriplegia. Prior to his accident he was a fully active member of society, but, unfortunately, because his accident occurred after the age of 65, he was not able to receive the level of care that really should have been his due. The government's response to recommendation 72 was non-committal, and no further clarity has been provided on this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When someone over the age of 65 has an accident—and everyone in this place should think carefully about how active people over 65 are, like some members of this place or parents of members in this place—they're not eligible for an NDIS package. An aged-care package is worth less than half that of an NDIS package. Sadly, in relation to Chris and Bobbie English, Chris passed away in January this year, but Bobbie continues to fight for equality for people who acquire disability over the age of 65. Recommendation 72 needs to be addressed. This is something that gets passed around between the minister for aged care and the ministers for social services and the NDIS. Something needs to be done in this respect. We need to make sure that age discrimination isn't occurring. Just as you brought the guidance for restrictive practices into line with that employed by NDIS, bringing support and assistance in relation to disabilities into alignment would also be essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the government introducing this legislation and acting on some of the recommendations of the royal commission, but much more needs to be done in this sector.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I am not alone in this place in being someone who has experienced having a parent in residential aged care. My wonderful father, Jack, spent the last couple of weeks of his life receiving beautiful, high-quality palliative care in a residential aged-care facility in the town where he had spent most of his life. High-quality care should not be the exception to the rule; it should just be the rule. The Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 is a first step in making some rules that will enable higher-quality aged care, because high-quality aged care must extend to everyone. One of my attempts at ensuring that this could happen again in my own community was to take up a position as volunteer director for an aged-care facility, and I did my best to make sure that we could deliver the highest-quality care to people in our facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces restrictive practices limitations. Restrictive practices include chemical and physical restraint, and environmental restraint such as seclusion. It clarifies the definition of 'restrictive practices' so that this mirrors the much better NDIS definition, and it will expand the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's ability to respond to breaches, issue written notices and make applications of civil penalty. This is a good place to start in aged-care reform, because we have all seen the heartbreaking testimony of the royal commission and we all have images of what it looks like to see an older person strapped to a chair, either with ties or with a table clicked into place, or, indeed, restricted in their movement due to the use of sedative drugs. It's an awful sight and one that I never welcome seeing. I know it shocks many people when they see it, but the question here is: why would this be happening in the first place? Why would restraint ever be used, and what consent would be required if it were determined to be the only remedy, the last resort, to guarantee a person's safety?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, known in the trade as BPSD, are a very challenging aspect of aged care. In Australia around 60 to 80 per cent of all residents in aged-care facilities have a cognitive impairment related to dementia. We know that the rates of dementia are rising. The associated behavioural and psychological disorders associated with dementia frequently result in the prescription of antipsychotic drugs and the use of these other forms of restraint. Person-centred care approaches to the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia has not been widely implemented, despite their reported effectiveness, and the barriers to the use of the non-pharmacological strategies need way more research. We need an evidence base that tells us what's stopping this happening in residential aged care. But what evidence we do have tells us of the positive impact of a person-centred approach, with skilled staff utilising, for example, music therapy, exercise and story work, ensuring that medical issues such as urinary tract infections and unmitigated pain receive rapid diagnosis and treatment and ensuring that issues like polypharmacy are addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at the core of this are staffing issues that preclude 24-hour access to registered nurses. We need to see all staff, including our personal care assistants, trained in behavioural management and we need to have access to experts in aged care, such as older persons nurse practitioners and mental health clinicians. Nurse practitioners are an incredible resource that could be mobilised across our aged-care sector if the policy levers were shifted to allow them to operate in a way that they could. Their access to Medicare items needs addressing urgently, and I call on the government to work closely with the College of Nurse Practitioners to get this happening. I know the Minister for Health has an interest in this area. So I encourage him to really get going on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen the job satisfaction and joy that aged-care workers experience when they are resourced in a way that allows them to give high-quality care and when they are resourced in a way that makes the use of restraint truly one of last resort and only implemented with full and informed consent—the last resort rather than the go-to. We must not see restraint as a default mechanism to compensate for inadequate staffing levels. So many aged-care workers do incredible work, with great love and care, and this bill is one small step to alleviate decisions of desperation—decisions that are made because of constraints, of there not being enough people on the floor. There are roughly 1,650 people living in residential aged care in Indi, and I want this bill to ensure that there should never be an instance when anyone visiting a loved one sees that loved one restrained without full knowledge and consent. Informed consent is key to the contract of trust that a provider enters into with a resident and their family. We need good, functional decision aids to assist staff and carers to give informed consent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this bill is around home-care assurance reviews. I have advocated for greater numbers of aged-care packages from the very first day, my very first speech in this House. It's crucial. It's what people want. I have been encouraged by the government's funding of additional aged-care packages in the last budget. And, of course, I call on them to keep going with that and to make sure that they cut that 100,000 people waitlist right back—well, completely, really. When we are paying good taxpayer money for aged-care services in the home, we want to see the highest-quality services that we can get. We want value for money and we want to see the right services delivered at the right time in the right place. We don't want to see packages eaten up by administrative fees or travel. We want to see adequate services in local areas close to where people live. I think the home-care assurance review is one step to making sure that that happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indi, over the last quarter, in 2020, 167 new people received a package. What I have been concerned about is what kind of packages they receive. We know that some people approved for high-level packages still remain on waitlists and are receiving lower-level packages. Again, I hope this bill goes towards improving the overall efficacy of the rollout of home-care packages, because we know that, when a person does not receive a home-care package at the level they need, it forces their hand to enter residential aged care much earlier than they otherwise would have. If, for example you live somewhere like Bright or Myrtleford, in the beautiful Alpine Valley region, there are very few residential beds available. There is no high-care aged-care facility in Bright at all. So, instead, we have people with high-care needs making the heartbreaking decision to move away from their homes to receive adequate care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They move into the bigger regional centres such as Wodonga, Wangaratta or Benalla. For some people who have spent their entire life in a beautiful little alpine village, this may as well be another planet. For their relatives, often elderly, having to make the trek to that other town is extremely difficult and heartbreaking. For some people, in winter, travelling from Bright through snow-covered mountains across to Mount Beauty is a trip they simply can't do. This often means that husbands and wives are separated, and that's a decision that no family should ever have to make. No longer can anyone just drop in on their way past to fit in with sports and school. A trip to see grandma or grandpa can be an hour and a half's drive away. For ageing friends with mobility issues, it's even harder to keep close.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for a high-care residential facility in Bright isn't new. This issue has been raging since the 1980s. That they are still waiting for a solution 30 years on tells its own story of intergenerational neglect of our older people in regional Australia by this government and successive governments. Bright needs better aged care so that our older community members can age in the place where they've raised their families and lived and contributed their whole lives. Luckily, though, we are united on a solution. We need a new 35- to 40-bed high-care facility run by Alpine Health and co-funded by state and federal governments. Alpine Health is now looking for money to have their master plan for redevelopment funded. This is the first step. The master plan and the feasibility study from 2015 identified the full redevelopment of the hospital, including the provision for aged care, with some extension into the vacant hospital block.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The master plan redevelopment was left out of the federal and state budgets. For the life of me, in an environment in which we are really promoting high-quality aged care, I don't understand why. But, in my conversations with ministers from both governments, they say they're happy to come to the table and work together to find a way forward to support aged care for people in Bright. I had a really constructive meeting with Mr Coulton, the Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government, who is very sympathetic to the situation. Like me, he knows rural communities right to his bones. We do share the experience of parents in aged care in our small rural towns. He sees a pathway forward to work with all parties to get the aged care this community needs, and I will continue to work with him and his office as we move this forward. A few weeks back I met with Mark Barnes and Cathy Eldred from the Bright Hospital redevelopment committee who have worked tirelessly for over a decade to get high-level aged care in Bright. I visited Alpine Health several times and met with residents and the CEO, Nick Shaw, on this proposal. I know that this is possible, and I know they have all the skills they need to make this happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care reform happens on a national level, like this bill, but change happens at the facility level—at the place and at the moment that people decide to enter residential aged care. I want to see state-of-the-art residential aged-care facilities in Bright. I want to see high-quality aged-care practices wherever people are, and that's where reforms in this legislation should play out. So, today, I call on the ministers and those holding the pen. We need more than platitudes. In places like Bright and in the alpine region, the need couldn't be any more clear. Follow up on the broad-reaching reforms in this bill with something we can see on the ground. I really look forward to working with the committee of Alpine Health and the federal and state governments to get this done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good bill, and I commend it to the House. I do, though, also support the member for Mayo in her call for a parliamentary committee to oversee the recommendations of the royal commission. This is one of the most important and one of the biggest reforms our nation will see. We have to get it right. We will all be judged by this. We must get it right.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  The aged-care royal commission has shone a harsh light on the horrific mistreatment of many older Australians. It has revealed the grave failures of the Morrison government to act on a broken aged-care system, summed up aptly, but tragically, in the title of the interim report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. The royal commission found that the Morrison government remains focused not on what should be done but on the minimum commitment it could get away with. Those aren't my words; they are the words of the commissioner. So I welcome the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, and Labor will support it, with amendments, as an important first step in correcting the mistakes of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are no small mistakes. These are horrific, systemic mistakes that have resulted in the gross neglect and mistreatment of many of our most vulnerable citizens—our elderly citizens who rely on this government to ensure that they're treated with dignity, respect and compassion. Sadly, it took a royal commission and the words of brave individuals to force this Prime Minister to act and to introduce amendments to further strengthen legislation on the use of restrictive practices in aged care. Six years ago the Australian Law Reform Commission made recommendations to the Liberal government to stop the overuse of physical and chemical restraints, labelling them as a human rights abuse. But these reforms were ignored by the Liberals, leaving our elderly at serious risk of maltreatment. For example, in January 2019, we saw footage of Terry Reeves. Terry had dementia. He was regularly tied to his chair with a lap belt, sometimes for a total of 14 hours a day, and was heavily sedated with antipsychotic drugs. Terry's daughter, Michelle, gave evidence at the royal commission of other residents with dementia being kept in a small room and strapped to their chairs, just like her father. The statistics are damning. In the final three months of 2019-20 residential aged-care services made 24,681 reports of intent to restrain and 62,800 reports of physical restraint devices. The stories were so shocking that the former Liberal aged-care minister announced the government would consider introducing new legislation, and here we are, many, many months later, finally seeing this occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation changes will bring the definition of restraint into alignment with the one applied under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The legislation will provide a clear definition and ensure all restrictive practices are included. It will expand the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's ability to respond to breaches of approved aged-care providers' responsibilities in relation to restrictive practices, and it will amend the Aged Care Act to empower the health department's secretary to conduct reviews to ensure the arrangements for the delivery of home care are effective and efficient. But this bill is nowhere near what we need to overhaul a broken system, a system that is no longer trusted by Australians due to the inaction of the Morrison government—inaction on malnutrition, inaction on sexual abuse, inaction on maltreatment and inaction on neglect in the aged-care sector. The legislation remains limited and unresponsive to many of the royal commission's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has rejected calls for a registered nurse to be on call 24/7 in aged care, and it has not dealt with the underpayment and overwork of aged-care workers. How can it be that workers in this female-dominated profession get paid less than someone stacking shelves at a supermarket? Labor would do so much better because we value workers and we value the tireless dedication of workers in this sector. I personally have experienced this with the care of my mother-in-law, who, sadly, died in aged care during the pandemic. And this bill does nothing to ensure greater transparency in the aged-care sector, with no requirement for the health department secretary to release reports for scrutiny. It is solely discretionary. It does not respond to the unacceptable number of older Australians waiting for home-care packages—it does respond but it will only reduce it, leaving more than 20,000 older Australians languishing on the waiting list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the vaccine rollout. Only three per cent of our population has been fully vaccinated, and the government cannot even tell us how many residents in aged care have been vaccinated. The government only had two jobs during this pandemic: to manage the vaccine rollout and to ensure a safe quarantine process, and they've failed on both accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, older Australians cannot afford another three years of this government. All Australians deserve a government that will treat our older citizens with dignity and respect and not abandon them to a failing system. We need a government that will restore trust in our aged-care system, because one day we may all face the prospect of entering an aged-care home and when that day comes we want to be assured that it will be a safe, caring and respectful place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  The Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 makes three urgent changes to deliver the first stage of aged-care reform developed in response to the royal commission and to ensure senior Australians receive high-quality and safe aged care. From 1 July 2021, this bill introduces important limitations on the ability for approved providers to use restraints and strengthens protections for aged-care recipients from any abuse associated with this practice. The term 'restraint' will be replaced with 'restrictive practices', continuing regulatory harmonisation with the disability sector. Further and more specific details of the strengthened obligations on approved providers will be prescribed by the Quality of Care Principles 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill and the amended principles provide a framework to minimise the use of restrictive practices. The amendments do not authorise the use of restrictive practices where they are otherwise unlawful. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's powers will be expanded to include the ability to give a written notice if a provider does not comply with its responsibilities relating to the use of restrictive practices and the ability to apply for a civil penalty order if they do not comply with the written notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care providers and their staff are very important. I know from personal observation that the vast majority of providers do a good job in my own electorate of Petrie up in Queensland—that's from talking to staff and residents in that area. But these changes here are to further strengthen what's required. I want to give a bit of a shout out to the staff in my own electorate of Petrie for the work that they do. They do an amazing job. The staff there care for people in aged care who in many ways helped to build this country. I know that many of those residents have had a difficult time as well with COVID-19 over the last 12 to 18 months. They haven't been able to leave the premises and also have not been able to receive visitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to young people too, as the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services, to maybe consider a career in caring for our elderly. That's very important. On Friday I visited a resident in my own electorate, Mr John Russell OAM, who is 101—it was his 101st birthday. He's a veteran from the Second World War. He spent seven years overseas and he actually spent time in Antarctica as well. He's also the author of a new book which has just been released. His daughter, Sue Morgan, is the carer for him. But I would say to young people that caring for our elderly Australians is a great career and that you can learn so much from elderly Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes an annual program of risk-based assurance reviews of home-care providers. The secretary of the Department of Health will be able to require approved home-care providers and their employees to provide information for the purposes of program assurance and to prepare and publish reports on the assurance reviews. This builds on our existing work to improve transparency of the aged-care sector and fosters community confidence in the costs of the aged care they receive. The bill also repeals a requirement for the minister to establish the Aged Care Financing Authority, the ACFA. An advisory group will be established to replace ACFA from July 2021, to ensure that the government continues to receive advice on financing issues in the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Today I am providing an update on some health issues in Shortland. In my recent community survey of Shortland residents, health care was ranked as the top third concern by all respondents. I imagine this would be similar right around Australia. Access to quality health care is of fundamental importance for all Australians. For me, health as a priority is particularly important as I represent the sixth-oldest electorate in the country. The elderly constituents and young families I represent care about health, and they care about the Liberals and Nationals attacks on Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before talking about Medicare, I briefly want to give an example of the government's appalling rollout of the COVID vaccine in Shortland. I was recently contacted by Joyce from Windale, who was distressed as she wasn't able to make an appointment for herself and her 95-year-old partner, Jack. Her medical practice is not able to distribute the vaccine because of government red tape. Joyce called my office as a last resort, desperate. She and Jack were determined to be vaccinated; they just had no idea about how to go about getting an appointment. I am pleased that my staff were able to assist them to get such an appointment. These are two elderly people, both clearly category 1a, who, nearly four months after the vaccine rollout began, have been left high and dry by this incompetent and bumbling government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people have also contacted my office regarding the government's recent Medicare changes. They are concerned about the Liberals' and Nationals' ongoing campaign to attack the cherished institution which is the basis of our healthcare system. The most recent changes come after years of eroding Medicare services by this government, which has fundamentally undermined the universality of the system and made it almost impossible for my constituents to find a bulk-billing doctor. The government's classification of my electorate as being metropolitan—the same as Mosman in Sydney—cutting how much GPs receive for bulk-billing, combined with the five-year pay freeze for GPs, mean that many of my constituents struggle to find a doctor that bulk-bills. I met recently with local GPs, and they were distraught at not being able to continue to bulk-bill their patients. One GP gave the example of having to swap from bulk-billing 80 per cent of his patients, with 20 per cent not bulk-billed—to only bulk-billing 20 per cent. Imagine that—a complete reversal in the ratio of those being bulk-billed. And now the changes to the MBS mean that people will pay much more for surgery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a few of the comments from my constituents over the last few weeks. Sharon said, 'All Australians should be able to access medical treatment regardless of their bank balance.' Ellen from Buff Point wrote, 'As an aged pensioner Medicare is very important to me and many others I know.' Barbara emailed saying: 'Medicare is an essential service for Australians and particularly disadvantaged Australians. We have an enviable  health system that must not be sabotaged.' Finally, Sarah wrote: 'My husband and I rely on the Medicare system. Having access to affordable health care means that we can continue to work and support our family because we can access health care when we need it.' These are a few examples of how the constituents I represent—constituents who live in regional, not metropolitan, Australia—feel about Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate that I represent, Shortland, not only has, for the most part, an elderly demographic but also has pockets of very significant socioeconomic disadvantage, and these constituents rely on Medicare. They can't afford to pay a gap to see their GP. For them, the choice is between doing the groceries or paying for an appointment. I know this because my constituents have told me this. This is a choice no Australian should ever have to make. And, as we know, if a consultation for treatment for a relatively straightforward complaint with a GP doesn't happen, that condition will get worse, often requiring attendance at a hospital emergency department, which puts even more pressure on our public hospitals, costing an already overstretched public system more. This demonstrates that undermining Medicare not only is disgusting from a social justice perspective but also makes no sense economically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bungled vaccine rollout and the distress and anxiety this has caused by constituents, many of them elderly, as well as the renewed attacks on Medicare are a clear sign that this tired Liberal-National government is not only incompetent and useless but also completely out of touch with the lives of ordinary Australians. And the government is at it again—undermining Australia's world-class healthcare system, in Medicare. The latest changes to the Medicare benefits scheme come after the recent cuts to bulk-billing rebates of GPs. These cuts, combined with a five-year GP freeze, mean that it is now virtually impossible for many of my constituents to find a bulk-billing doctor in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At least the Liberals had the integrity in the mid-1990s to say that they would abolish Medicare. Now they are killing it by a thousand sneaky cuts. Labor will oppose this. I will oppose this because Medicare is the fundamental essence of a fair and just Australia, and I will stand up for my constituents.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  As the representative for Goldstein now for five years and two terms in, and seeking a third, I believe it's important to refresh the trust of representation as headier waters form on the horizon. Going into preselection, I made a promise to myself, knowing that I could never live with losing if I'd pretended to be someone else and that if I'd won on those terms it would always haunt the full longevity of my service, whereas living with losing when you're true to yourself only comes from accepting that others were looking for something else and that, upon winning, you needn't contort yourself because they always knew that they supported you and why. I've taken the same approach to each federal election: to not hide or deceive but to be candid and forthright with electors, which is rarely the foundation for agreement but often for trust. But this came with the added promise that, if successful, my decisions would be made on a hierarchy: Australia first, Goldstein second, party third, self always last.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Parliament is not a <span style="font-style:italic;">Congress</span> of Ambassadors from different and hostile interests … Parliament is a <span style="font-style:italic;">deliberative</span> Assembly of <span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> Nation, with <span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> Interest, that of the whole.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are community representatives, but we vote for the nation. The issues present when we put ourselves to the mercy of the ballot needn't be those that define the term. None of us have an inherent right to be here, and if your incentive is longevity you should question why you are here, as, if it comes to that matter, should an MP who cannot successfully drive change here without persuading at least 75 others and 39 in the other place. Nimble compromise is necessary to be effective and to know which hills are worthy of sacrifice. It is from principle that policy must derive, least of all because we should want our elected representatives to show the courage of their convictions in pursuit of the national interest. But neither exists unless underpinned by core belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no common opinion that unites communities, but there can be common values; therefore, we should not be blinded by temporary policy challenges when compared to the influence of eternal values that inform our judgements. Burke also correctly identified:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Your Representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In parliament we are rarely faced with binary choices. All require the weighing of competing considerations that necessitate judgement to make considered decisions that advance Australia. All members know those who seek to assert power over them by saying, 'Do as I wish or I won't vote for you.' MPs should respond by saying, 'If I did, you should not.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Should a community elect a populist, they elect a weathervane which swings in their direction only until the wind changes. Populism may make a representative popular temporarily, but that is a false charm, as they will inevitably trade national interest for self-interest. Our relationship to the community is to fulfil the trust afforded by listening. But to truly honour it, the relationship must be founded on respect derived from honesty and candour. Others will judge, but, to date, that's the basis upon which I have sought to represent the good people of Goldstein, and it is the one upon which I will continue to do so in the future, with their favour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my lifetime, the long moral arc of history has bent favourably, but Australia and the world will need representatives with moral courage for it to continue. That comes from core belief—core belief that they take to the people, seeking trust to implement it into policy that advances our nation. That will sometimes depend on withstanding prevailing winds and upon a constituency that appreciates that principled stands serve a higher purpose. I know that Goldstein values such principles and such service and that we must always seek to make a stronger Australia.</span>

A community of around 320 people, it is the home of the iconic Barunga Festival, one of the longest-running festivals of its type in Australia. It has been held every year since 1985, and I have been to most of those celebrations.</span>

It's a proud tradition of celebrating the best of remote Aboriginal Australia, and I want to thank the generosity of the traditional owners, the Bagala and the Jawoyn people, for opening their community to share their country and their culture when I was there on the Queen's birthday weekend. It attracts around 4,000 people, both First Australians and the broader community, from all over the country, who descend on this small remote community to camp and take part in the extensive three-day program of music, sport, traditional arts and cultural activities. They play footy, and one of the teams was short of a few players, so their coach wandered around the camping ground and spotted a couple of Victorians and said, 'Do you feel like a game?' They ended up playing for two days!</span>

It's steeped in history, First Nations politics and a belief in a treaty going back to 1988, when Prime Minister Bob Hawke was first presented with the Barunga Statement, the architects of which were principally Galarrwuy Yunupingu, the then chairman of Northern Land Council, and Wenten Rubuntja, who was the chairman of the Central Land Council. It came out of years of engagement and advocacy. In 1988, when the rest of Australia was commemorating Australia's bicentenary and the arrival of colonisation, Aboriginal clans from across the Northern Territory delivered the all-encompassing statement at Barunga. This remarkable bark document, decorated in art from both saltwater country and desert country, has at its heart a call for a treaty between the Indigenous owners and occupiers of Australia and the Australian government and people to recognise their rights, and these rights are listed. I might point out that the very last act of Bob Hawke as Prime Minister was to hang the Barunga Statement in this parliament. The rights requested are not extraordinary. They are fundamental human rights: acknowledgement, respect and good manners. The Barunga Statement calls on the Commonwealth to pass laws providing the following:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="203092" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  The electorate of North Sydney is bordered by the beauty of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers and Middle Harbour. We are a community as we are a city that has been shaped by these incredible waterways. This is a phenomena of not just recent times but ancient as well. The harbour was to have a profound impact on the Indigenous peoples who occupied its foreshores for tens of thousands of years, including the Cammeraygal and Wallumettagal peoples, who lived in the region partly covered by my constituency. Protecting and preserving our harbour environment and its foreshores is a cause that has touched the hearts and minds of so many Sydneysiders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents of my own electorate today, and for so many generations, have a long and rich history of defending our local environment. It's something I've always championed, both as a federal MP and also during my time as a local councillor and as a resident. Today, as a result of the foresight and actions of so many residents, much of my electorate is fringed by beautiful parks and bushland, the value of which was rediscovered by many during the lockdowns of 2020. In my own neighbourhood I never cease to be awe-struck by the beauty of places like Balls Head, so close to our great CBD but yet a place of nature and tranquillity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our efforts to protect our harbour foreshores continue as new opportunities arise. Just last week, for example, the New South Wales government made important decisions which will enhance our foreshores. I want to congratulate my state colleague Felicity Wilson, the member for North Shore, on the announcement that private land has been acquired in McMahons Point to expand Blues Point Reserve, one of our city's great vantage points. Also last week, the New South Wales minister for heritage, Don Harwin, announced the heritage listing of the coal loader in Waverton, which North Sydney Council has transformed into one of our area's most popular and precious sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the federal level, I have long been a supporter of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. In an earlier life I was proud to have a role in its establishment by the Howard government. The trust will go down as one of John Howard's greatest legacies for the people of Sydney and Australia. The trust manages some of the jewels in the crown of Sydney Harbour: former Defence sites which have been saved for all Australians. I am very pleased that legislation has now passed both houses of this parliament which will ensure that the role of the trust and the protection of these sites continues in perpetuity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the trust manages the Woolwich Dock and former Sub Base <span style="font-style:italic;">Platypus</span> on behalf of the Commonwealth. Last week, with the $10.4 million that I worked so hard to secure, the trust was able to announce the final plans for the creation of a new park at Sub Base Platypus. This will be a wonderful addition to harbourside open space on Neutral Bay, which I know will be enjoyed by both local residents and indeed all Sydneysiders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to reflect on an anniversary being marked this month which is so significant to the history of community activism in protecting our harbour foreshores. It was 50 years ago that a group of 13 women from Hunters Hill accomplished the seemingly impossible by enlisting the BLF and its secretary Jack Mundey to institute a green ban on proposals for the development of an area that is known as Kellys Bush. This was an unlikely alliance between largely Liberal-voting women from one of our most prosperous suburbs in Sydney and what was a radical and militant group of unionists. And yet their actions would go down in history and, most importantly of all, save this incredible area of bushland on the Parramatta River in Hunters Hill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Led by Betty James, 13 mothers came together to form a group that became known as the 'Battlers for Kellys Bush' to fight proposals which would have seen this place of beauty developed into high-density housing, including eight-story apartment blocks. It in fact took the battlers 13 years to achieve their goal of saving Kellys Bush, but they never gave up. That spirit of determination and perseverance has inspired thousands of others, not just in Sydney but in fact across the globe—such was the attention that their actions attracted. One of our local journals, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Village Observer</span>, recently wrote that those women:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… organised campaigns, protests, and courted the media over tea and homemade baked goods. Their well-mannered, conservative and relentless approach was impossible to ignore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today their work is continued by the Friends of Kellys Bush, supported by Hunters Hill Council and indeed by the entire Hunters Hill community. It is an anniversary that should be marked for its enduring legacy, not just for local residents but for all of those of us who love and value our great harbour. We are in the debt of those brave, determined women and all they achieved for our city.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  In March this year the Morrison government was forced to release the findings of the Functional and Efficiency Review of the National Archives of Australia. This was a review commissioned almost two years earlier and headed by Mr David Tune AO, PSM, the highly respected former head of the Department of Finance. Mr Tune provided that final report to the former Attorney-General, the member for Pearce, back in January last year, 17 months ago. As he did with the Respect@Work report, provided to him that same month by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins, the former Attorney-General responded in his usual fashion, by doing absolutely nothing. In fact, a whole year went by before the government released the Tune report in response to media demands and the legal requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. Just why the government had been so reluctant to release the Tune report became clear, as it laid bare the disaster the National Archives is facing after eight long years of neglect by this government. The situation is so bad that, without urgent funding, unique and important records will soon be lost from our history forever. Those irreplaceable records include film of early Australian Antarctic exploration, ASIO spy surveillance footage, audio recordings of the royal commission into the stolen generations, Prime Minister John Curtin's wartime speeches and priceless letters from World War II prisoners of war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January last year the Tune review warned $67.7 million was urgently needed over the next seven years to digitise the highest priority records before they are lost forever. Yet, in last year's budget, the Morrison government gave the National Archives precisely nothing to implement that urgent recommendation. Incredibly, last month's budget did it again, with not a single extra dollar to implement the Tune report recommendations. Instead, they sent out a junior minister, Senator Stoker, to dismiss the concerns of Australians who care about our heritage with a series of facile comments trying to justify the government's neglect. In a disastrous performance at Senate estimates, Senator Stoker dismissed concerns about the disintegration of our precious historical records as just 'part of the ageing process' and 'time marches on'. Time does march on, Senator Stoker. That's why we need national archives. This is a government that claims to follow the conservative political tradition, a government that claims Robert Menzies as its inspiration. But conservatives don't trash Australia's history. Menzies didn't trash the National Archives; he established it. Fortunately, this government's contempt for our nation's heritage is being noticed and called out for the disgrace that it is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A campaign has been launched by over 150 eminent Australians, including some of our greatest historians, writers, researchers and thinkers, two Nobel laureates, former science minister Barry Jones and former Liberal Premier Ted Baillieu, calling for the National Archives to be saved from the Morrison government's wanton neglect. In an open letter to the Prime Minister that group wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we fear that the integrity of the nation's premier memory bank, the National Archives of Australia, is in jeopardy … the National Archives is one of the pillars of our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, which is refusing to provide even a paltry $10 million per year to preserve our nation's irreplaceable historical records, is the same government that unlawfully diverted over $100 million into a Liberal Party election slush fund under the sports rorts scandal. It is the same government that handed over $33 million to a Liberal Party donor for airport land worth $3 million, and the same government now paying out nearly $2 billion to settle its callous, unlawful and catastrophically failed robodebt scheme. Perhaps the government is hoping that numerous records of its own conduct will be irretrievably lost, records like the colour coded spreadsheets at the heart of the sports rorts scandal. Or perhaps they hope that the documents revealing what happened with the airport land scandal will be lost. Maybe Mr Morrison is hoping we lose forever the documents that reveal his personal involvement in establishing the shameful and illegal robodebt fiasco. The willingness of the government to let our history rot, rather than implementing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  Not unless you're the member for Bennelong! I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate several significant figures in the community of Bennelong who have recently been acknowledged through the Queen's Birthday Honours List. It is very fortunate that we've had so many recipients this year, although it's not surprising, as Bennelong is home to many people who have quietly worked hard to improve their community, better their profession or generally striven for excellence. It is a privilege to inform you of their successes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To begin with, Ms Narelle Barker has been made a Member of the Order of Australia for her services to education and the community. Ms Barker has had an exceptional career in education spanning more than 40 years and, in addition to that, has contributed greatly to several local volunteer organisations, including as a member of Rotary and as a supporter of the Salvation Army and Neighbourhood Watch. Since 2017, she's also been a director of Christian Community Aid, an organisation that I know firsthand because it does so much to improve the lives of vulnerable people in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, Dr Elizabeth Harris has also been made a Member of the Order of Australia for services to equity in health care, to research and to social work. Dr Harris is an adjunct associate professor at the University of New South Wales medicine and health department and has worked as a clinician, health services manager, tertiary educator and public health researcher. She is focused principally on addressing health inequality and has worked on subjects including unemployment and health, child health, interventions in disadvantaged communities and the promotion of public health policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our final and most recent addition to the membership of the Order of Australia is Ms Anna Lao for services to badminton and to the multicultural community. Ms Lao is the most successful badminton player in the history of Australia, having won numerous Australian championships before going on to represent Australia at the 1992 summer Olympics at Barcelona in both singles and doubles, where she placed fifth, better than any other Australian badminton player in history. She later went on to win the French Open in that same year. After her retirement from professional badminton, she founded the Australian Badminton Academy here in Sydney in 2002. The academy has become the largest and most successful of academies in New South Wales. Ms Lao's impact on badminton in Australia has been tremendous, and I congratulate her on all of her achievements and contributions to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, I'm proud to say that four members of my community have been acknowledged with the Medal of the Order of Australia. Ms Christine Howe has been acknowledged for her services to secondary education. Ms Howe is the Director of Performance for the Catholic Education Diocese of Parramatta and has had a critical role in Catholic education in our community. Mrs Norma Notley has been recognised for her long service to the 1st North Ryde Scout Group. Mrs Notley has served an incredible period of more than 60 years to the Scouts, which she is tremendously attached to, and it is a great achievement. Mr David Rickards has received his award for his service as Chair of Social Enterprise Finance Australia, which provides financing support to Australian social enterprises in fields such as affordable housing, education, arts, community enterprises and disability organisations. Finally, Mr Michael Robertson has been recognised for his service to the community as a foster carer and to transport safety. I thank him for his service to us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These recipients are testament to the community spirit and kindness that we have in our suburbs. We are so fortunate to live in an area with such great civic society and local residents who are so involved in our community. If 2020 was the year we locked down, it was also the year we opened up our communities and opened up to our neighbours, ensuring that everyone has been okay and ensuring that no-one was isolated in these tough times. We have so much to be grateful for in our communities, and I am so glad that we can acknowledge these wonderful people here today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise today to speak on behalf of the pensioners of my electorate. Time and time again the Morrison government shows nothing but contempt for the pensioners of this country. Just last week every member of the Morrison government voted against not cutting the pension. What message does that send to pensioners in my community and around the country who have worked hard and helped build the communities that we all live in today? It tells them that this government is not on their side. This government is not on the side of pensioners and it will take any chance it gets to cut and destroy our social security system. Just last year it tried to freeze the pension. For the first time in two decades there wasn't going to be an increase, and it wasn't until Labor caught the government out on this that it acted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deeming rates is something I've raised in this place before. The government continues to short-change pensioners by maintaining unreasonable, inflated pension deeming rates. In the middle of a pandemic, when pensioners are anxious about costs and staying safe, while things are changing all around them, the government short-changes them on deeming rates. Since the Liberals and Nationals have been in government the cash rate has been cut 10 times, yet the aged pension upper deeming rate has been adjusted only four times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of respect this government has for older Australians and the lack of support it gives pensioners is shameful. We see this with the speculation about a cashless welfare card—a privatised card which keeps 80 per cent of people's pension payment. The Minister for Families and Social Services has signalled her intent, saying she wants to start a conversation about universal cashless welfare cards. If the government gets its way, all pensioners will be moved onto a cashless welfare card managed by a third party—a private equity firm that will dictate what pensioners will be able to spend their money on. Pensioners won't have cash. Think of all the things that an aged pensioner might use cash for: lunch at the RSL in their community, the second-hand goods that they buy, or a scratchie or lotto ticket. Pensioners won't be able to use the cashless welfare card for these purchases.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the concept of a cashless welfare card carries a stigma, and in communities that have been part of trials there are many people who feel shame and embarrassment. Is this how this government wants to treat older Australians? Is this how it wants to treat pensioners? These are people who should have dignity in their retirement. They're people we should be supporting, not telling them their spending habits need to be monitored. We know these cards don't work. Privatising welfare doesn't work. We should be standing up for pensioners. Pensioners deserve a government that's on their side, not one that's telling them what they can spend their money on or one that's maintaining unreasonable deeming rates. Labor will always stand up for pensioners. We know they built this country. We've got your back. Labor is on your side.</span>

We all know that one person's trash is another's treasure, and at the moment it has never been a better time for local people in the Redcliffe Peninsula, Moreton Bay or north Brisbane areas to recycle at Peninsula and Bay Scrap Metal Recycling. I went down there the other day. People bring in all sorts of items: hot-water systems, old air-conditioning units, car bodies, metal bar stools—even the kitchen sink is recyclable. It's all worth dollars in your hand. Michelle Wardle, who is the co-owner of Peninsula and Bay Scrap Metal Recycling, said that years ago it was mainly tradies who were bringing in this scrap, but nowadays it's mums and dads and even some of the youth who want to earn a little bit of extra pocket money. So go down to Peninsula and Bay Scrap Metal Recycling, opposite the dog park in Clontarf; it's a great place to go. Michelle said the biggest change over that period has been people's attitude to recycling. She and her husband, Glen, began their business with partners Sharon and Craig McQuade. She said that it's just changed so much, as people don't want public landfill anymore. So get your old metal and take it down to Peninsula and Bay Scrap Metal Recycling—a great local business on the Redcliffe Peninsula.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that the Morrison government worked to get Australia's first ever national recycling act by passing the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 through the Senate six months ago. This legislation permanently banned the export of waste, including plastics, paper and tyres. Businesses like Quality Plastic Products are leading the way in Australia in developing technology to keep onshore and replace our imported plastic products for use in the gardening and nursery area. In fact, there is a production team negotiating with Bunnings right now to replace 60 per cent of their imported plastic products. Often these imported plastic products can't be recycled; they're made from styrofoam. This is great news for the environment, but it's also great for Australian jobs and jobs in the Petrie electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quality Plastic Products's tag line is 'Australian made from recyclable materials that won't cost the earth'. It's clever, but it's also true. We need to find creative solutions for our waste for the good of the earth. The Morrison government is backing businesses like Quality Plastic Products by awarding it a $465,000 manufacturing modernisation grant to invest in new robotic technologies that will encourage innovation, boost productivity and grow Australia's competitiveness. This will enable businesses like this to expand their workforce as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  Our community in Little Bay had a big win on Friday when the planning panel rejected the outrageous proposal by the developer Meriton. The south-east Sydney planning panel unanimously decided to reject a plan for 1,900 new apartments in Little Bay. It was a clear case of overdevelopment at it's worst, but it brought out the best in our community who joined together to fight Meriton and its arrogant approach. That saw opposition from local residents, Randwick City Council and local Labor MPs of the state and federal level who stood together and said, 'Enough is enough.' So Little Bay has been saved for now after a hard-fought campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was over a year ago that the council had already rejected Meriton's proposal in favour of the existing master plan for the site that was in place when the developer bought into the area, but Meriton tried to ride roughshod over the local planning process and go straight to the state planning authority. When the master plan was approved in 2009, it allowed for 450 dwellings at five storeys. Meriton wanted to build 1,900 dwellings up to 18 storeys high on the same site. It is pure greed and over the top. Thankfully, the south-east Sydney planning panel found that the proposal had 'unmitigated significant impacts on transport and amenity'. The scale of the development simply wasn't supported by existing transport infrastructure, and the panel found that Meriton wanted to impose 18-storey towers at a level of density that was inappropriate and out of character for the iconic Little Bay area. Indeed, the height and bulk distribution of buildings and the intrusion into the view corridors to the coast from the surrounding areas would have been significantly impacted, and it would have significantly impacted the amenity of the site, its environment and the surrounding area, as the panel said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The panel has left the door open for future lower scale development at the site. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is an opportunity for alternative distributions of development density and built form on certain parts of the site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, our community isn't opposed to any development at Little Bay, but there have to be restrictions. It has to work within the master plan. The support for the existing master plan is that it be in line with existing residential developments and character in this iconic part of Sydney. Meriton must now abide by the master plan if it wants to have any future in the Little Bay community. The developer can't simply keep gaming the planning system until it gets its way. Little Bay has been saved for now. I thank everyone in the community that got behind this wonderful community campaign.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first book <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Bushland Shire</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Story of Hornsby Shire</span>, published in March this year, is a compilation of local history research from the district. Contributors to the book include Tom Richmond OAM, Councillor Nathan Tilbury, Ralph Hawkins, Derek Woodlands, Rosemary Curtis, Gillian Diekman, Elizabeth Roberts, Mari Metzke, Patricia Dewey, Julie Debray, Mariana Landeo and Robert Green, and the foreword is written by Philip Ruddock. <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Bushland Shire</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Story of Hornsby Shire</span> has a chapter on every suburb in the shire and focuses on key landmarks, vibrant communities and the transformation as the shire has gone from rural lands to being part of metropolitan Sydney. The book includes chapters on the Hawkesbury River; the communities of Dangar Island, Bar Island, Marramarra Creek, Wisemans Ferry and Milsons Passage; and the Old Northern Road and the suburbs along this historic road from Castle Hill and Glenhaven to Dural, Glenorie, Forest Glen, Canoelands, Maroota and many others.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second book I want to mention is <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Asquith NSW</span>. This two-volume history book, written by Robert Green, covers 160 years of the history of the suburb of Asquith, named after the British Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith in 1915. While Asquith is a relatively small suburb of 347 hectares, with a population of approximately 3,500, it is rich in its history. Green's book is the result of three years research and records details of the first land grants and subdivisions, as well as the early struggles as the pioneers cleared their land, established orchards, raised families and transported their produce to the Sydney markets by horse and cart, which at that time, extraordinarily, was a two-day return journey. The construction and opening of the Northern railway line in 1887 saw the beginning of the development of Asquith. Partial land resumptions reduced the number of orchards in the area and saw the growth of community organisations, including the establishment of six churches in the early 20th century. The Asquith Shopping Centre buildings on the Pacific Highway are mostly unchanged since the 1950s and 1960s. However, there has been significant growth and change in the area with the construction of many high-rise apartment buildings over the last five years. The book contains 18 chapters, covering land in the state, subdivisions, how Asquith was named, and a history of the suburb's streets, shops, businesses, transport, sporting and community organisations, parks, playgrounds, churches, schools, government utilities, industrial areas and housing statistics. There are stories about accidents, incidents and crimes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Hardie's significant work, including highlighting the importance of curiosity and cross-disciplinary cooperation in science education, has led to his recognition as a Member of the Order of Australia. I commend him on his decades of involvement in professional societies as both a member and an office bearer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Barbara Bates—or Barb, as she's known—at a Paint the Town REaD event in Katoomba, inspiring teachers and librarians to share the joy of reading. I'm thrilled that she's been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for that amazing initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Isaacs has been recognised with the OAM for services to the community through a range of roles, including as the driver of important Rotary projects, including one on homelessness. His award is very well deserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An OAM has also been received by Frances Maguire, particularly for her work in organisations dedicated to reducing violence against women and her contributions through the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dharug woman Coralie Richmond is as active in her 80s as she was in her 40s, I think, and her list of community service, especially to the Blue Mountains, is extraordinary, from teaching to being a director of the Blue Mountains Aboriginal Cultural and Resource Centre and volunteering with the Salvos during the recent fires. It's a joy to see her recognised with an OAM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Advocating for veterans has been central to Brian Turner's life, and his recognition with the Medal of the Order of Australia is absolutely fitting. I'd like to note the huge amount of work he put in following the fire at the Katoomba RSL. Brian played an intrinsic role in the success in rebuilding and refitting that RSL for veterans following a very sad event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three meritorious awards were also presented this year. The Australian Police Medal was awarded to Chief Inspector Sean McDermott, with specific mention of his role in improving the police response to victims of domestic violence. Murray West's work, including through the Black Summer bushfires, has resulted in his receiving the Australian Fire Service Medal. And the Ambulance Service Medal was awarded to Michelle Shiel, including for her contribution to New South Wales Ambulance's operational response during those same fires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank each and every one of these women and men for their commitment to our community in so many different ways and congratulate them on their recognition.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I often say how proud and honoured I am to be the representative of the Chisholm electorate. The reason why I am so proud of Chisholm is largely down to those living in Chisholm. I have met some of the most incredible hardworking and committed individuals across my time as the federal member. Members of my community never cease to amaze me with their achievements and the work they do in the area. I'm thrilled to see a number of these individuals are represented in the Queen's Birthday honours this year. I've had the privilege of calling a number of those who received awards to congratulate them and talk about the outstanding work they do in Chisholm and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take the time to highlight those who have contributed enormously to those around them. Firstly, there is Professor Kylie Ball, who has provided significant service to physical activity and nutrition education. She is an academic powerhouse and an impressive woman. Congratulations to Professor Ball. Then there is Jan Rice, a strong and capable woman who I had the pleasure of speaking with last week. She has been instrumental in the provision of services to nursing, wound care and education. Well done on your award, Jan. Susan Campbell is another resident of Chisholm who I had the privilege of speaking with last week to congratulate her on her achievements. She has played a pivotal part for youth in the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. Thank you, Susan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I give a shout-out to Kevin Mitchell, our very own ex-football legend in the electorate and another well-deserving addition to the Order of Australia. Even off the field, he has continued to make a notable contribution to the game. For that I commend him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could continue to talk about the impressive achievements of all recipients of the OAM, but I simply don't have enough time. So I would like to give a quick shout-out to Mr Phong Nguyen, Ms Kaye Speed and Ms Deborah Upstill—all worthy recipients. I congratulate all of you on the recognition you have received for your contributions and achievements.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  Recently during National Volunteers Week I had the privilege of recognising just some of the thousands of volunteers in the community at the annual Werriwa Volunteer Awards. I congratulate the 2021 winners: Kiran, Selima, Shewetha, Anne-Marie, Krishna, Gwenda and Sanjeevkumar. I especially thank the people in our community who have taken the time to nominate the awardees. The volunteers come from all parts of our community—Meals on Wheels, SEWA Australia, CNA Italian Services, the Salvation Army, headspace, Prestons Robins Little Athletics, Mounties, environmental groups, sporting clubs and public schools—the list goes on. SEWA Australia, in particular, coordinates blood drives three times a year, with one of their volunteers having recorded more than 70 donations of blood and plasma in just three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers ensure that important community activities such as delivering meals, allowing children to play sport and providing disaster relief can take place. Almost six million Australians over the age of 15 volunteer their time across the country each year. The rate, however, has declined by almost eight per cent in the last 10 years. Casualisation of the workforce, stay-at-home requirements for older Australians in the pandemic and other stresses often mean the same commitments can no longer be met, but I thank all volunteers in Werriwa who take the time to serve their community. You make our community the wonderful place it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the pleasure of visiting the new mycar store at Edmondson Park. Mycar is one of the largest employers in the automotive service and repair industry, with more than 1,300 employees Australia-wide and 260 store locations. They are also the single largest employer of apprentice motor mechanics in Australia. I thank Adam and the team for showing me the impressive new store and explaining the innovative measures they employ. Mycar recycles all the oil it uses. It does so with purpose-built methods which keep the workshop clean and make sure it can all be recycled. I wish you all the best for your future within Werriwa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago, Liverpool City Council hosted a civic reception for the South West Sydney Academy of Sport athletes. As a previous board member, I know the academy provides an opportunity for elite athletes, coaches and administrators to both improve their skills and learn new concepts in nutrition, leadership and fitness. Many of the graduates of the program have represented Australia, New South Wales and regional areas at the elite level, even winning gold medals at the Olympics. To this year's representatives: good luck for the future. I thank Gerry Knights, Peter and the volunteer board members for all they do to ensure that the youth in our community get the opportunities they deserve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282982" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Reid has very long, historic and proud ties to the veteran community. Last Friday I attended the official opening of Fussell House at Concord Repatriation General Hospital, in my electorate. Fussell House provides a non-clinical place for veterans to stay together and share experiences in a relaxed environment while receiving support and treatment at the National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare. The National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare is a world-class facility, and the New South Wales government should be commended for the significant investment in the future wellbeing of veterans and their families in this state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new facility, Fussell House, is named after Lieutenant Michael Fussell, who was serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan when he was tragically killed in action by an improvised explosive device. It was a privilege to have his parents, Ken and Madeline Fussell, at the opening. Their son gave our country his life for our freedom, and, on behalf of all Australians, I say we are eternally grateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth provided $6.7 million to develop the Fussell House accommodation facility, which forms part of the world-class National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare at the Concord hospital. The 19-room facility will especially benefit those from regional and rural areas when veterans are getting treatment. It will also allow families to stay with the veterans as they are receiving treatment—which is very important, because family support is critical to recovery. We know that veterans overwhelmingly prefer to have their family close at hand and involved in their treatment and care, and that is why this new facility is just so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare has multiple specialists in one location, working as a multidisciplinary team. The specialists combine with the patient and their family, carers and primary healthcare providers to create one collaborative treatment team. Further enhancing the care provided to veterans and their families, the centre has established links with community support organisations, including Open Arms—Veterans &amp; Families Counselling as well as local educational facilities and schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of Soldier On in the development of this community. Mr Ivan Slavich, the CEO of Soldier On, provided crucial support for the family, and the Soldier On charity continues to provide critical support to services for our veteran community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fitting that my electorate of Reid is the location for this magnificent facility. From the Burwood War Memorial Arch, to Concord hospital's historical ties to the Australian Army, to the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in Rhodes, Reid is the very proud home of the veteran community. While we can never fully repay the debt we owe to Lieutenant Fussell, I am pleased that we can continue to honour his memory and his sacrifice for our nation through his ongoing legacy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a valued local, a friend and an all-round legend, Billy Metcalfe. Billy is a proud Kurri boy and a passionate community advocate. On 1 April this year, Kurri's favourite dynamic duo, Billy and Di Metcalfe, called it a day for our beloved Station Hotel. They celebrated 20 years as being some of the best publicans at the iconic and oldest pub in Kurri Kurri. For two decades they provided locals with a space to talk, laugh, shed a tear or two and just generally get together. Billy has been a fantastic example of community minded business activism, having spent much of his life advocating for improved facilities for our town and our region. It was bigger than the pub. It was bigger than Billy himself. It was about Kurri; it was about our community; it was about his love for the place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Billy and I have known each other since I was a little kid. I can't actually tell you when I first met Billy, such was his legendary status. He's a relative of one of my best friends. The first time I really realised that Bill was so passionate about our region was when he started to talk to me about the Richmond Vale Rail Trail. He knew that this disused railway line, which was built by the great entrepreneur John Brown, was going to be something that could change our region forever. If people were allowed to ride bikes and walk along the full 48-kilometre stretch of rail from Kurri Kurri all the way into Hexham and then on to Newcastle, it would open our region up to jobs and potential, to tourism. It would educate our young people about our rich and diverse mining history, the environmental pieces that go through that track, the old bridges—just an incredible piece of community infrastructure. Billy had a vision and still has that vision for that infrastructure. I tell you now, Bill: I want that project as much as anyone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Billy has not only created a haven in our town with the Station Hotel; he's created so many other things. He's been part of the Kurri Mongrels bush riding group, where the guys and girls get together and ride their mountain bikes out through the bush of Kurri Kurri. It is just such a fantastic spot. Most rides take off from the Station Hotel. Billy and Di put in extra accommodation because they could see the opportunity for people coming to our area to visit the murals of Kurri Kurri and then go on to the vineyards for concerts.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  As I raised in this chamber on 12 May this year, the eagle needs to be sent home. Cigna pharmaceuticals and nib Health Funds, in a recently announced collaboration, have formed this joint venture under the term, ironically, Honeysuckle Health, with the intention, obviously, of working towards some minimal cost savings, which ultimately can, in the end—and we know from US experience—harm patient care. These contracting groups that we have seen from the US are basically a bundling value-based contract and they basically put the hands of insurers on the clinical decisions between the doctor and the patient. And it's a bad precedent. I'm deeply concerned because I've seen what's happened in the US. If there's one thing to say about the US health system, it is that they have struggled to rein in costs. Eventually these network care arrangements produce these silos of non-overlapping care, where patients are locked into narrow and separate providers, and increasingly costs and restrictions and multiple tiers lead to limits in choice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give you some examples. There is an additional $10,000 to transport a patient to a hospital that's not in the network, and an additional $36,000 of healthcare costs because you're transporting, by helicopter, someone to a hospital that's not in the network. There is an insurance administrator who basically scurries around hospital corridors looking for patients to discharge, against medical advice, because the beds aren't there and the company bed count has been exceeded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are gynaecologists who claim that a patient needs a hysterectomy but they have to wait until the haemoglobin level falls to a particular point before the insurance company allows them to proceed. There is, remarkably, the need for insurance pre-approval before an operation can be performed, and we require permission again from an admissions clerk. The breast cancer procedure is performed by a general surgeon rather than a breast surgeon, and the reconstruction is done by a surgeon who is not qualified in either plastic or breast surgery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's ironic they use the term Honeysuckle Health, because we here in Australia all know that honeysuckles are an invasive and pestilent species, recognised as such in North America and across Europe, and the way to treat an invasive pest of this kind is generous doses of glyphosate. We're asking this chamber and this nation to recognise that we shouldn't need to resort to such extreme measures, because a simple piece of legislation that I know would have support from the other side of the chamber would simply mandate that we keep this important competition between providers and hospitals in place. The purchaser-provider split is a very important part of high-quality and contested work. The last thing we want to see is private health insurers purchasing into hospitals and promising early on no-cost and low-cost services for very simple cases, because ultimately it is the complex cases that can blow out and cause extreme out-of-pocket pressures on patients. Say no to Honeysuckle Health and no to deals with our Australian healthcare providers. Let's sendtheeaglehome.com.au.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I am pleased to be able to address the house in relation to the health budget over the course of 2021-22. All up, there will be over $121 billion invested across the portfolio and related activities in other portfolios for health, aged care and sport. Of most significance are, of course, the central pillars of the portfolio. In terms of Medicare, we see growth from approximately $19 billion in the year prior to us coming into government to $30 billion, $31 billion, $32 billion and $33 billion. That includes an additional investment of $6 billion in Medicare alone in this budget, including $711 million for new Medicare items. That's an incredibly important investment, whether it's in relation to blood pressure; whether it's in relation to new items for infants for aortic valve treatment; or whether it's in relation to mental health and antidepressive activities such as, for the first time, the listing of transcranial magnetic stimulation, a very important treatment. That is then accompanied by the investment in new medicines: a critical investment of $43 billion over the course of the coming four years. We've already delivered over 2,600 new medicines, but this budget specifically, for example, included the listing of Emgality for the treatment of migraine. That will help some thousands of patients save thousands of dollars a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, the budget includes a very significant package in relation to hospitals. What we see is a $6 billion increase in the amount of funding for hospitals. From $13 billion when we came in, that will grow over the course of this budget to $26 billion, $27 billion, $28 billion and $29 billion a year. Then, of course, what we see is the fundamental investments in mental health and in aged care. There is $17.7 billion for aged care and, as part of that response to the royal commission, this package is built across five pillars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First is home care, with an over $7½ billion investment, including 80,000 additional packages. We see here that we will have gone from approximately 60,000 aged-care packages when we came into government to 275,000, a rate of growth which is vastly in excess of the population growth, a rate of investment vastly in excess of the population growth in the over 70s or in any age group. So we had to take the situation as we inherited it, and we have addressed that challenge and it is fundamentally important. It also includes over $790 million under home care for support of respite, and that's to assist both older Australians and their carers—critically and fundamentally important steps forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pillar, of course, is residential aged-care sustainability, and, as part of that, there's $7.8 billion, with several fundamental elements. The first is the increase, in line with the royal commission's recommendation, of a $10-a-day basic daily fee uplift. That's an investment of over $3.1 billion. The second is the adoption of the standards of safety and care, of 200 minutes a day of care, which will lead to a $3.9 billion increase over the course of the forward estimates or projections in the budget. The third is the residential aged-care quality and safety actions, and these include the ability to ensure we have over $300 million for doctors to make in-home visits to residential aged-care facilities, backed by an over $600 million investment in the workforce—in particular, with retention bonuses for nurses. Finally there is governance, with a nearly $700 million investment, which will be critical with all of the new steps that are being taken forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've added to that $2.3 billion for mental health, which I will explore further on in the discussions. That's fundamental to saving and protecting lives, with a particular focus on youth and Indigenous suicide prevention and treatment right across the age groups.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  In the time I have today I want to focus on mental health, particularly the mental health and wellbeing of young Australians. Recent natural disasters, such as bushfires and floods and, of course, the COVID-19 global pandemic, have brought mental health and suicide prevention policy into sharp focus. In Australia each year, more than 3,000 people lose their lives to suicide, and suicide remains the leading cause of death for Australians between the ages of 15 and 44 years. In addition, one in five Australians experience some form of mental illness each year, with about three-quarters of common mental health problems emerging before 25 years of age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A study conducted by the Black Dog Institute, surveying more than 5,000 people between March and April last year, saw 78 per cent of respondents report their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, with more than three-quarters of all who responded saying they felt uncertain about the future. As Associate Professor Jill Newby observed at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given that loneliness, social isolation, and financial stress are significant risk factors for poor mental and physical health these findings really are concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this backdrop, and the findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry's report into mental health received by the government in June last year, the Victorian royal commission and, more recently, the report of the National Suicide Prevention Adviser, Christine Morgan, the budget delivered in May provided some welcome funding commitments, including funding for a National Suicide Prevention Office and for follow-up or postvention for every person discharged from hospital following a suicide attempt. Given my experience working in adult acute mental-health inpatient units for almost 10 years, these are significant announcements, and it is our hope, working in a bipartisan way, that the measures announced in the budget are introduced quickly, as the need is urgent and growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of concern that there have been announcements in the previous two budgets that have not yet been implemented. I am regularly contacted by members on behalf of local people desperate to know when their promised headspace will be up and running or expanded, given the urgency and growing unmet need. While announcements matter, delivery is what counts, and young people, their families and caregivers in many communities across Australia are running out of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I met with the City of Swan from Western Australia. With a population of 160,000 and a third of local people aged under 24, they have a headspace in Midland and a satellite in Ellenbrook and told me that young people are waiting eight to 12 months for an initial assessment. That's not for the start of therapy or a treatment plan; that's for an initial assessment. Tomorrow I am meeting with Mitchell Shire. They have a dedicated volunteer suicide prevention service but are struggling, with the nearest mental-health inpatient beds—and only 17 of them—an hour's drive away in Shepparton. In my own community, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in 2019 there was a commitment for a $1.5 million new headspace for Wyong. Minister, you've said to me recently that this would soon be delivered, but, as yet, it's not open. For young people in my community, particularly through COVID, this is incredibly distressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant barriers which must be overcome to implement the budget measures and other outstanding mental health announcements or commitments. The first one is workforce: the critical shortage of trained and experienced mental health workers, especially outside of big cities. We understand the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy is being developed by the Department of Health and the National Mental Health Commission to consider the quality, supply, distribution and structure of the mental health workforce and identify practical approaches for Australian governments to attract, train and retain the workforce needed to address the growing demands of the future mental health system. I understand this workforce strategy was due to be completed this month. However, we understand that it may be delayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another hurdle is the ambiguity over the responsibilities and accountabilities of the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. This issue was raised both by the Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health System and by the Productivity Commission in its mental health report. It is hoped that work currently being undertaken with the states and territories to resolve these issues will result in existing gaps and the poor coordination of mental health services being overcome. Another significant problem which is of much concern is the accessibility and affordability of mental health services. Like other health services, access to mental health supports is a particular problem in outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas. Increasing out-of-pocket costs for both GPs and medical specialists compound these problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions are: Will the government make sure measures announced in the 2021 budget and previous budgets are delivered as a matter of urgency? Can the government advise when the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy will be completed? Will the government provide an update on the delivery of headspace commitments across Australia, as this is urgent?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  The Australian government is certainly committed to improving the health of people in rural, regional and remote Australia in supporting better teaching, training, recruitment and retention of our rural health workforce. Regional Australia is driving Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19 through our investment in the health portfolio. In the 2021-22 budget we continue to support the regions and local communities to prosper and to grow. This investment will benefit regional and rural communities and support the government's JobMaker plan for Australia, emerging from the pandemic with a more resilient and competitive economy. However, we understand the challenges associated with attracting and retaining doctors and health professionals to rural areas, and therefore I ask: can the minister please detail measures in the budget that will encourage doctors to train and practise in regional, rural and remote areas?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always been a very strong and passionate advocate for rural health because I've seen firsthand the benefits of a strong and robust rural health sector, especially in my electorate of Leichhardt. I and my good friend Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari, have been co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Rural and Remote Health for quite some time. This is why I have to say that we were both very pleased to see that the new office of the National Rural Health Commissioner would be established in my home town of Cairns. This is another major step forward in closing the health gap between rural Australia and major cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A focus of the commissioner's role is to work with communities experiencing chronic workforce shortages to develop new models of care which reflect the communities' circumstances. The office will also play a key role in supporting the government's ongoing rural response to COVID-19, which includes advising on the impact of the health workforce in regional, rural and remote communities in keeping people informed about the vaccine rollout. I, along with regional health minister Mark Coulton, recently had the pleasure of officially opening the office of the National Rural Health Commissioner in Cairns. There is absolutely no doubt that the commissioner, Professor Ruth Stewart—who hails from Thursday Island, so you can't really get more remote and rural than that—and her team will do an amazing job. I look forward to working closely with Professor Stewart to deliver better health outcomes for residents right across my vast electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another initiative announced in this year's budget is the government's $65.5 million investment over four years in rural bulk-billing incentives in rural and remote medical practices. A new and progressive incentive schedule will be applied that increases the value of rural bulk-billing incentives based on remoteness. This will enhance the financial viability of practices in rural and remote areas as well as reduce the gap paid by patients. The more remote the area, based on the Modified Monash Model, the greater the incentive payment that it will receive per eligible consultation to recognise greater challenges and cost pressures. Therefore, about 10,158 medical providers in country areas will immediately benefit from this announcement, including many of those in my electorate of Leichhardt. The rural bulk-billing initiative encourages doctors to offer medical services without out-of-pocket costs to vulnerable populations, including children under the age of 16, senior Australians and concession card holders. On average, Australians in rural and remote areas have poorer access to the use of health services compared to people who live in metropolitan areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make mention of the government's $2.3 billion investment in mental health and suicide prevention, the largest investment in Australia's history. This issue is one that I am extremely passionate about. Given that I am the independent chair of my own headspace, I have to say that I was particularly pleased to see the funding allocated towards a new national network of 57 national mental health treatment centres and satellites as well as the expansion of the headspace program. Sadly, one in four Australians are affected by a mental health illness every year. Headspace offers a safe, welcoming place where young people can get non-judgemental, professional help and peer support so that they can tackle their challenges in a way that is right for them. With that, I'd like to also give a shout-out to Gabrielle Gill, the manager of our headspace, and her team. They do an outstanding job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's critically important that young people can access the mental health services they need and to make sure that they've got access to them when they're needed. This record investment in mental health reinforces our government's strong commitment to achieving better mental health outcomes. Finally, I'd like to say thank you very much to our health minister for the outstanding job he has done during this— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the issues still facing our healthcare system through the pandemic and into the future. First of all, to give credit where it is due, I do credit the Minister for Health and Aged Care with our very good response to the pandemic. I don't credit the Prime Minister, because, of course, as we all know, he was off to the footy during the beginning of the pandemic. I think he failed to understand the seriousness of the issue, and I think the minister was the one that brought us back on track. I thank him for his hard work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times during my time in parliament about the issues facing our healthcare system and on Medicare in particular. Medicare was founded on two principles: universality and equity. This has gradually been eroded during the eight-year term of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has recently introduced some changes to the Medicare schedule, and they are very likely to make the erosion of the universality and equity of Medicare even worse, by all accounts. I've worked in the system for over four decades. I've seen what's happening to our healthcare system. It's becoming less and less equitable and more and more difficult for people on low incomes and for disadvantaged people to access the best of 21st century health care. We're still experiencing lockdowns, I know, during the pandemic, but this has made things even worse for things like waiting lists for cataract surgery and for outpatient services. The issues are getting worse and worse, particularly in those areas of disadvantage: outer metropolitan Sydney and rural and remote areas. Health care in Australia is becoming less and less obtainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before I came into the meeting today, I did a quick run around of some practices in south-west Sydney. For example, to access a private consultation with a paediatrician, the gap cost varies between $120 and $200. For a cardiologist, the average is around $200. So this is making health care less and less affordable for people who are disadvantaged and on low incomes. People shouldn't have to worry about putting food on the table and a roof over their heads before paying for health care. It erodes the primary principle of Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shameful attacks on Medicare by the coalition have meant that for many people health outcomes and life expectancy are dramatically worse just because of their postcode or their socioeconomic status. I've stated previously that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has detailed that as many as 1.5 million Australians are avoiding Medicare services annually owing to costs. We've seen the collapse of our public outpatient system. Again, I did a ring around this morning to see if I could get someone into a virologist at our local hospitals and either the phone rang out or I was put on a queue of over 20 minutes to get through—just to try to make an appointment. I don't know how long the waiting lists are, but they are preventing people from accessing the best of our health care. These are people with chronic illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, strokes, seizure disorders et cetera. The cost of medical care is skyrocketing and that is making it more and more difficult to access even primary care. I have contacted the minister's office on a number of occasions about the difficulty people in my electorate are having in accessing GPs. Nothing has been done; I get a motherhood statement but nothing else. The minister is constantly trying to politicise issues such as the PBS, which for the long-term has been bipartisan, yet we get no action on people accessing primary care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to ask the minister several questions. Will the minister ask the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport to investigate the local effects of the recently announced Medicare changes in terms of access to care and increases in gap costs? Does the minister concede that outpatient services at our public hospitals are at breaking point due to a lack of adequate resourcing and what specific plans does the government have to try to improve this? Out-of-pocket expenses have skyrocketed over the last eight years. What does the minister plan to do to rein in soaring gap costs for Australian patients? Will the minister commit to revisiting the classification of distribution priority areas for regions that are presently struggling to recruit and retain general practitioners and specialists? What will the minister do to make our health care more equitable and more universal for all Australians, not just those at the top end of town?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I rise to discuss with the Australian people how important it is that we continue to fund investment in our National Health and Medical Research Council. Our medical research fraternity should be congratulated on the wonderful work they have been doing to back in Australia's health. I would like to ask questions of the health minister about how we continue to increase and support the investment in this critical sector of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government supports the critical role of health and medical research in improving health outcomes and that has been very clear through the COVID pandemic. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Health and Aged Care for leading what has been an exemplary response to the global COVID crisis. Since the commencement of the Medical Research Future Fund, in 2016-17, the government has invested $1.5 billion in medical research projects through the fund. I was a medical researcher at the time of this announcement, and I have to say that this was regarded internationally as world's best practice. As Australians and as Australian taxpayers, we should feel incredibly proud of our forethought in creating the Medical Research Future Fund. It has provided surety, certainty and sustainability for the medical research sector, which results in improved health outcomes for patients right around Australia not just in cures and care but also in prevention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NHMRC funds over $800 million worth of competitive research grants each and every year. A total of $3.6 billion has been committed to the NHMRC over the four years from 2021-22. As of May 2021 the Biomedical Translation Fund has made 22 investments totalling $233 million in 21 companies conducting late-stage biomedical research. As someone who has been involved in the Biomedical Translation Fund, I know how important this is to the critical and innovative ideas that Australian researchers are making each and every day. We know that this research helps drive forward improved care for patients, improved prevention for concerns about illnesses that are emerging as we speak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed $5 billion to the 10-year Medical Research Future Fund investment plan around four important pillars. The first is patients and investment in improving patient outcomes, with $1.3 billion of additional funding being provided for vital clinical trials activities and new research funding to tackle global health issues, including COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second is investing in researchers, our people who do the research, with $792 million to build the capacity of Australian researchers through the provision of additional fellowship positions. Again, I have been a recipient of a National Health and Medical Research Fund fellowship position, and I can tell you that the day on which the letter came from the minister for health was one of the best days of my life, because effectively it was saying, 'We back you and the research that you are doing.' It is an incredible privilege to receive one of these fellowships, and it is so important to the future of our health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third area the government is investing in is research missions. These are really new and novel, and they're very strategic: $1.4 billion to support crucial Australian missions that have the potential to challenge current ways of thinking and transform medical research by inspiring researchers to be bold and change the face of medicine. We know this because we've heard the minister for health announce these missions, including missions regarding cardiovascular health and genomics—all sorts of missions that are making a change. The Million Minds one also comes to mind. This is changing the way we do health care, and Australians should feel very proud of the work that is being done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth is research translation: $1.5 billion to harness research and translate it into real-world benefits. This is not just about doing ivory tower research; it's about making a real impact and a real difference to the lives of Australians. It will also support the establishment and extension of data infrastructure to support world-class health and medical research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, these investments are consistent with the new Australian Medical Research and Innovation Priorities 2020-2022, developed by the independent Australian Medical Research Advisory Board, AMRAB, following national consultation in accordance with the Medical Research Future Fund Act 2015. These are independent assessments, and they are very important for the integrity of the system. My question to the minister is: what is the federal government doing to continue to support the excellence of the medical research sector and the health outcomes of this country? I'd like to again thank the minister for health for the amazing leadership he has shown through an incredible health crisis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Throughout this pandemic, aged-care residents and aged-care workers have been at the greatest risk of COVID-19 infection, but we still have large concerns about the rollout of the vaccine in these facilities. Last year, 335,889 Australians used some form of aged care. The federal government is the primary regulator and funder of this system. Last year, it spent $21.2 billion on aged care. At the same time, we had a royal commission telling us that the system is woefully inadequate. When it comes to the rollout of the vaccine, again, it is woefully inadequate in what has happened and, indeed, not happened in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've put on notice questions to the minister about the rollout of the vaccination program in my electorate. Having not received answers to those questions yet, I'm going to ask them here again. On what date were residents in each of the aged-care facilities in the Perth electorate first offered a vaccine for COVID-19? On what date were staff in each of the aged-care facilities in the Perth electorate offered a vaccine? What percentage of residents in each of the aged-care facilities in Perth are fully vaccinated, and what percentage of staff in each of the aged-care facilities in the electorate of Perth are fully vaccinated? We know that there is huge community concern about the rollout of this vaccination program, and every time we look closer we are more disappointed and we find out that there are more and more gaps in this system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big gap is in the quarantine system, which we are continuing to pretend is fine. Hotel quarantine in the CBD is no longer acceptable. It was a good emergency response but, more than a year into this pandemic, we need something smarter and safer than hotel quarantine. It's the businesses and communities in my electorate in the Perth CBD who are hit worst when we have leaks out of the hotel quarantine system, and we know there will be more leaks. So I would also like the minister to explain: Why did the budget contain no additional funding for new national quarantine facilities? Is the minister actively considering the proposal from Perth Airport to have a quarantine system on the grounds of Perth Airport? Is the minister talking to his colleague the defence minister about using RAAF Base Learmonth as an alternative location or seriously considering the proposals from the state government to use somewhere such as Busselton, close to Busselton Margaret River Airport, to provide proper quarantine facilities for Western Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a note of curiosity, as I came in here, I saw the report about the Prime Minister doing some private tourist business while he was attending the G7. We saw the Prime Minister doing private tourist business while on an official government trip. I'd be interested if the health minister can explain how we can have one rule for millions of Australians and a different rule for the Prime Minister to be able to go to a pub, visit family and track his family history. I'd be interested to know if the health minister was aware of this, whether the health minister gave any advice, whether any of the chief medical officers or any of the health officials were aware the Prime Minister wasn't just planning to attend the G7 but was also planning to go on a holiday in the United Kingdom in the middle of a global pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to mental health, I think we all need to know where all these new headspace clinics that were announced in the budget are going to be. The minister would know right now where they are intending to put those headspace clinics. There is a clear need in my electorate in Perth to have a headspace centre located in the Perth CBD. Currently, my constituents are forced to go to either Midland or Osborne Park, and we know we have a large number of young people who need that mental health support somewhere that's easy for them to access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, when it comes to the importance of universal health care, I, like many in this parliament, have benefited from a world-class public health system. I was a chronic asthmatic as a child, in and out of the Fremantle emergency department more times than I can count. I'll always defend having a proper universal health system. So why is it that we've got these sneaky, unclear almost 1,000 changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, where we don't have the full detail released by the minister? Again, the minister has these details and he could release more detail. Why hasn't it been released? What items have been cut? What impact will it have on public hospitals in Western Australia? Does the budget fully reflect the changes you are planning to make to Medicare?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Mental health and suicide prevention are key health priorities and central features of the Commonwealth's Long Term National Health Plan. The government is committed to transforming the mental health system and has undertaken an ambitious reform agenda. The government has established a number of reviews to consider the decades-long issues in the mental health system. These include the Productivity Commission inquiry into mental health and the report of the National Suicide Prevention Adviser. Together with the Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health System and the House of Representatives Select Committee on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, these reviews will inform and drive the long-term national reform work already underway to establish a more integrated, person oriented Australian mental health and suicide prevention system for the benefit of all Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, under the new national health reform committee, the government is developing a new national health and suicide prevention agreement with states and territories. It is expected that this new agreement will be finalised towards the end of this year. The agreement will help establish a single integrated national mental health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2021-22 budget, the government is investing a record $2.3 billion in the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan to lead landmark reform. Based on the principles of prevention, compassion and care, the plan will invest $1.4 billion in high-quality, person centred treatment, including $820.1 million for the national network of mental health centres for adults, youth and children through the Head to Health and headspace programs. The plan is based on five key pillars: prevention and early intervention, suicide prevention, treatment, supporting the vulnerable and, of course, workforce and governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $2.3 billion plan is the first phase of the response to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and the National Suicide Prevention Adviser, all of which the government has accepted in full, in part or in principle. Many of the reforms require collaboration with the state and territory governments, with a number to be pursued jointly through a new national mental health and suicide prevention agreement to be finalised by November. The 2021-22 budget builds on the additional $485.7 million in mental health services, and supports in the 2020-21 budget, including additional funding for bushfire recovery, suicide prevention and mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pillar 1 in the mental health approach is prevention and early intervention, with $248.6 million invested and $164.9 million from Health. This includes spending in digital, to create a world-class digital mental-health service system, including commencing the transformation of the existing Head to Health gateway into a comprehensive national mental health platform. It includes support for perinatal services, with $47.4 million allocated to perinatal services; and legal services, with $77.1 million in the National Legal Assistance Partnership to support early resolution of legal problems for those experiencing mental illness. It also includes support for fly-in fly-out workers and drive-in drive-out workers, with $6.3 million allocated to that, and for workforce participation, with $5.7 million to build on the Individual Placement and Support Program. There's small business support, with Ahead for Business digital hub supporting small business owners to take proactive, preventive and early steps to improve their mental health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many aspects to this. But my question to the minister is: could the minister please outline how the $2.3 billion for the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, and investments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, are improving access to new and improved mental health treatments through the government's continued investment in Medicare?</span>

We have had yet another confirmed case of breakout from quarantine. This federal government is looking more and more shambolic by the day, and, as I stand here, as of the last few minutes, we now have a new Deputy Prime Minister of this country, in the member for New England. This vaccine rollout is leaving Australians vulnerable, and, instead of fixing it, those in this shambolic government are obsessed with themselves—obsessed with their own internals—and are now serving Australia by returning to Barnaby Joyce, the member for New England. There is no urgency to fix the vaccine rollout, and I stand here to ask questions of the minister for health about the vaccine rollout.</span>

                    </a>  I can hear the interjections from the minister for health, but I'm going to read out a transcript from the ABC. The minister for health says Norman Swan is wrong. What happened with Pfizer last June is that they wanted to make Australia an example to the world about how to roll out—a bit like Israel or other places—and they said: 'How much do you want? And when do you want it?' And on 10 July there was a meeting, and what I'm told happened at that meeting was that there was an inexperienced person there with procurement. They were pretty rude at that meeting, and they said: 'Well, you're going to have to give us all your IP,' which is an amazing thing to have said, and started nickel-and-diming on the cost, and essentially the conversation stopped. And reports also are that Moderna did the same thing. Make no mistake: Pfizer and Moderna offered Australia as many vaccines as we needed, and this federal government, hiding behind whatever advice they choose, at that time decided to say no. Pfizer and Moderna offered as many vaccines as we needed, and we as a country said no.</span>

                    </a>  The fact of the matter is that Australia does not have enough vaccines. We have repeatedly been told by the government that we are on track, and we are not on track. We have fully vaccinated less than five per cent of our population. In a private briefing to the Australian Labor Party, I remember personally asking an official—I'm not going to name the official, but it was a senior health official—'Why are we not doing deals with Moderna?' It was a very dismissive answer: we didn't need them. They felt, at that time, the decision was to go with the AstraZeneca vaccine, and that has been the strategy all along. Now the federal government are in the situation, where, instead of having adequate vaccine supply, they are stuck with a vaccine that is not recommended for under 60s. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a problem entirely of the federal government's own making. Do you want to know why we are way behind comparable countries? Do you want to know why people are turning up to sporting events in the United States and we're going into restrictions on the east coast of Australia? It's because the federal government hasn't vaccinated enough Australians. That's it—that's the reason. We should have way more than five per cent of the population fully vaccinated. The percentage of fully vaccinated people should be in the 50s. We have a fantastic health system. But the strategy, the procurement and the decisions from the start of this vaccine rollout have been wrong. Instead of admitting it, this federal government has doubled down. They put all their eggs in the AstraZeneca basket, and Australians are paying the price. The government should start being honest about it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  In response to the final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the Morrison government will deliver a $17.7 billion package of support that will deliver respect, care and dignity to our senior Australians. This investment will deliver generational change, with improved quality care and increased viability in the sector, with services respecting the needs and choices of senior Australians. It is also the largest investment in aged care and the largest response to a royal commission in Australian history. The government has listened to the experiences of the Australians who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety and is taking decisive action to implement the recommendations, with the reforms to deliver vital services and improved quality care and viability in aged care. Our plans build on recent aged-care quality reforms, including those announced throughout the royal commission's inquiry, the COVID-19 pandemic and in the immediate response to the release of the final report. We welcome the royal commission's final report and have founded our response on the principles of respect, care and dignity. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In responding to the 148 recommendations, the government has accepted, or accepted in principle, 126 recommendations. Our response includes a five-year implementation plan underpinned by five pillars. These pillars are home care, residential aged-care services and sustainability, residential aged-care quality and safety, workforce, and governance. Under home care, we understand that senior Australians want to remain independent and in control, living at home and connected to their community. The government is providing $7.5 billion to home-care support, which will enable 80,000 more home-care packages, increase support for informal and family carers, increase support for senior Australians to find the aged-care services they need, increase Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission checks, and increase pricing transparency to ensure value for money. The government will also develop a new support at home program, providing better focused services for over a million people. It will give senior Australians greater choice when it comes to their care. The home-care funding will also boost residential respite services and early referrals to carer gateway services. The My Aged Care website and contact centre will continue to be a key entry point and a source of information for services and supports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the residential aged-care services and sustainability pillar, the government will invest $3.9 billion over four years to increase frontline care. From 1 July a new daily fee supplement of $10 per resident per day will give immediate support for daily services, such as food, nutrition, linen and cleaning. Additional funding will support face-to-face care for each resident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reforms under the residential aged-care quality and safety pillar will strengthen the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission to further protect senior Australians. We will invest $231.9 million to enable the commission to do more site audits, to enforce regulation of physical and chemical restraint use, to expand the Serious Incident Response Scheme to home care, to increase funding for the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service and the severe behaviour response teams and to give specialist dementia training to aged-care providers. A new star-rating system will highlight the quality of aged-care services, helping provide informed decision-making for senior Australians, their families, friends and carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the workforce pillar, the government is growing the home-care workforce by 18,000 and will provide additional financial support and incentives for registered nurses. We will also improve regulations and worker-screening arrangements to attract the right workers to the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the final pillar, governance, the government will support aged-care providers to improve their governance and meet stronger legislative obligations. We will create a local network of department staff, ensuring national planning is informed by local issues and needs. The new Inspector-General of Aged Care will provide independent oversight, and older people will have a voice through the Council of Elders. The new National Aged Care Advisory Council will support reforms development and offer expert advice to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year under this government home-care packages are up, residential care places are up and aged-care funding is up. Based on the most recent data available, recurrent investment in home care in my electorate of Longman went from about $19.38 million in 2018-19 to $25.26 million in 2019-20 and investment in residential aged care in Longman went from $99.1 million in 2018-19 to $104 million in 2019-20. Will the minister please explain how the government has responded to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety to improve the quality of care and dignity for our senior Australians?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  My first question to the Minister for Health and Aged Care is: will the minister urgently look to reform the distribution priority area system to allow bulk-billing GP clinics, like those in Carrum Downs and Frankston in my electorate, to recruit doctors to service the people in my electorate? The minister would be aware that I have raised in this parliament and written to him about four different GP clinics in my electorate. Dr Ravi Ravoori from the Myhealth Bayside Medical Centre has said to me that the DPA classification needs to change because he cannot attract doctors to his area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the minister recently and outlined the situation where the only female doctor working in that clinic has had difficulties finalising her exams as part of her SAPP placement, significantly due to COVID. She can no longer work at that clinic. Dr Ravoori cannot recruit a female GP to that clinic in the Bayside mall, which the minister, who comes from my area, would be aware is an enormous shopping centre that has, extraordinarily, something like 400,000 people going through it a week. That is the bulk-billing clinic in the centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Ravoori's concern is that there is now no one specifically to deal with the mental health issues of people who attend that mall. It has been a very successful model. Dr Naseri, who can no longer work there, has been responsible for that mental health. If Dr Naseri is unable to get her medical practising certificate, as Dr Ravoori says, it's the DPA classification, which does not set Dunkley as an outer metropolitan priority area, which will prevent him from recruiting another doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of the other medical clinics that I have raised previously and have written to the minister about are part of a group of medical clinics. They are specifically the Ballarto Medical Centre, on Ballarto Road in Carrum Downs; and St Mary Medical Centre, which is on Frankston-Dandenong Road in Carrum Downs. It is becoming a desperate situation for these two medical clinics, which provide bulk-billing services to some of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of my electorate. It means that the medical clinics are struggling to function, but, as the minister would be well aware, it also means that members of my community can't access health care when they need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very recently, Rachael Hatzopoulos, the group operations manager for these two clinics, wrote to me again. She wrote: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">to see if there is anything that can be done to try to help us. The Department of Health have made it impossible to recruit doctors to a bulk-billing clinic in a metro location. We have struggled so much with the St Mary Medical Centre especially. We open until 10 pm and all weekends and public holidays, and rely on one doctor for after hours. Our three other GPs in St Mary are so heavily booked with patients and cannot do any more than they are doing. Our patient demand is far greater than our capacity. We are turning patients away daily and often after hours have to direct them to emergency when they could easily be handled in primary care. It is so ironic given the television commercials I am seeing that say 'don't call 000 or go to emergency; see your local GP'. It's a very big contradiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A few weeks ago it was quite upsetting that someone put a post in one of the community notice board pages about how bad our waiting times are. We do take appointments, but patients also know if they are unwell they can walk in when needed. There were a subsequent 60-odd comments of complaints about how we should just, quote, 'Get more doctors,' along with many other comments. We have done so much to try to get more doctors to offer more appointments to patients, without any success. We have many doctors that contact us wanting to work, but the Department of Health and immigration restrictions make it impossible. I am just reaching out with the hope you may be able to help us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, my question to the minister for health is: will you urgently review the entire system, but specifically these medical clinics and the issues in the electorate of Dunkley? Affordable universal health care is under threat because GP clinics that bulk-bill cannot get doctors to service some of the most vulnerable members of my community.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  We've had very valuable contributions, although I may not agree with all of them, in particular across five areas: mental health, rural access, Medicare, aged-care, and coronavirus and the national response. I'll respond to the first two of those, mental health and rural access, in this, and the latter three items if given subsequent opportunity. In particular with regard to mental health, amongst others, the members for Dobell, Reid, Leichhardt and Perth have all raised questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to mental health, let me begin by saying that this has been the largest ever investment in mental health in any budget in the course of the federal parliament, with an additional $2.3 billion as part of our National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, which is our response to the Productivity Commission. It covers five particular pillars. The first is in relation to prevention and early intervention. It has a particular focus on young people but it's not confined to young people, because these issues transcend all ages, sadly, and very much in many cases tragically. That includes $250 million, of which the largest component is $111 million for expanding and extending the Head to Health online and telephone network. We want to be able to support all Australians at any time. In the dark of the night it's 3 am and somebody is having a mental health crisis, and that capacity to reach out through the Head to Health network is a critical one. It's about having a common national system. It's both a destination in itself and an access vehicle for Beyond Blue, Lifeline, Kids Helpline and so many other areas, all of which have been supported in the course of the budget and in this particular component.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pillar is, critically, suicide prevention, which has the support of all members on all sides of both houses of parliament. It's a $300 million investment. The most significant element—and I acknowledge the member for Dobell, who recognised and appreciated the government's commitment to this—is $158 million to establish what's called a universal aftercare system. The single group in our nation who are most likely to take their lives are those who've been discharged from hospital having previously attempted. So to offer all of those people the capacity for follow-up care and for follow-up treatment, I hope, will save not just hundreds of lives but thousands of lives over the course of the coming decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our achievements during COVID has been that, to date, we have not seen the much-predicted increase in the loss of life to suicide. We haven't seen a significant decrease, so we have a lot of work to do. But what could have been has not eventuated thanks to comprehensive work and, in particular, the telehealth system which was put in place. We'll also be putting in place $22 million for postvention to support the family and friends that have been left bereaved. We know that suicide, sadly, can have a contagion effect, and it can be catastrophic across communities. We'll be creating an office of national suicide prevention for the first time ever, charged with the singular task of reducing suicide rates and coordinating national responses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treatment is the third pillar and the area of largest investment—$1.4 billion, including $820 million for creating the three-tier comprehensive national approach to mental health treatment. We will have 40 initial national adult Head to Health treatment centres. We will grow to 164 headspace centres. The Wyong headspace centre, which was asked about by the member for Dobell, is due to be completed in Q4 of this year, but the Lake Haven centre will be upgraded, with a $4 million investment, from a satellite to a full headspace. We will have 15 Head to Health kid centres for treatment. Related to that, there will be $100 million for the vulnerable, including $77 million for Indigenous Australians. There will be $200 million for workforce—in particular, there was a question about workforce—which includes $59 million directly for workforce training, $16 million for GPs and $117 million for evidence. And then, on rural and remote, we have a very strong initiative of expanding the bulk-billing incentive rate for the Modified Monash Model 3 to 7 areas, which will help both with investment and incentives for doctors. That's coupled with the expansion of telehealth, with a $200 million investment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  Minister, can you provide detail of how the $12 million to continue the Rheumatic Fever Strategy will be spent and how the $19.1 million to continue and improve the Trachoma Elimination Program will be spent? In addition, Minister, I would like for you to provide advice on why funding of a very successful program which treats RHD at Maningrida will be discontinued as at 30 June. You'd be aware, Minister, that Maningrida has the highest incidence of RHD per capita in Australia and amongst the highest in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mala'la Health Service Aboriginal Corporation has been funded to provide a targeted program that provides a focus on improving long-term secondary prophylaxis and a focus on new activities to prevent the incidence of acute rheumatic fever by addressing primordial causes. They provide community education, they provide screening, they have an employment and development program in which three community workers have been developed and trained to carry out education sessions and skin checks, and they employ a healthy homes coordinator, who coordinates the activities and provides support for education and community workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, Mala'la's outcomes to date have been very encouraging. They've developed an active referral to the RHD program for clinical staff to treat clients at the clinic for scabies. This allows for home visits, which facilitates the second treatment necessary to treat mites and engage with the household for environmental assessment. Three community workers have been recruited in full-time employment, and all have undertaken training and are competent in telling the Heart Story. All schoolchildren attending school and their teachers receive regular education sessions about the Heart Story and have a good level of health literacy. More than 3,000 skin checks have been carried out and treated, if there was evidence of any skin sores or infections, with all cases of scabies treated. Over 150 homes have been checked, and maintenance issues have been reported. A partnership has been established with the West Arnhem Regional Council, Maningrida College and One Disease. Rates of compliance with secondary prophylaxis have increased significantly during the funding period: in the last quarterly report, 82 per cent of the clients on Bicillin were receiving 85 to 100 per cent of prescribed doses. None of these activities, Minister, will continue beyond 30 June without additional funding. So could you provide detail as to why funding has not been made available, and will you undertake to ensure funding is made available beyond 30 June?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I respect the fact that you have allocated funding for a working partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to develop and finalise in mid-2021 the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan 2021-23 and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Strategic Framework and Implementation Plan 2021-2031. Minister, could you provide details of expenditure on the initial plan, 2013-23? Can you advise on the implementation strategy for that original plan? Can you advise on the agreed implementation strategy and what has been funded? And could you advise on what funding has been made available for specific measures and what those measures have been? I understand that the plan is being reviewed, as I have previously said, but could you advise on the process being engaged for the reviewing of the plan, the timing and the consultation process, and could you advise on whether or not the central themes of the original plan will be continued? Will you advise further on the progress of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workforce plan and the central elements of it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I am encouraged by some of the words you have spoken to us about COVID in the bush, but could you detail for me, please, the extent to which COVID testing has been undertaken for remote aged-care patients in Aboriginal communities? Could you also advise us on the rollout of COVID vaccines across northern Australia but particularly in remote Aboriginal communities? Understanding that there have been huge issues around the reluctance of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—but particularly Aboriginal people in remote places—to be vaccinated, I would like to understand what public education campaigns the government is funding in that space.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we look at health. Hand sanitiser, masks, QR codes and contact tracing have become the norm as Australians make sure we are looking out for each other's health and protecting our communities. But one thing that hasn't changed is the Morrison government's commitment to the health and wellbeing of all Australians and our guarantee for the essential services Australians rely on. That's why, in the federal budget, we've committed an additional $6 billion to Medicare. In this budget, we've committed $30 billion to Medicare, increasing to $31 billion, $32 billion and $33 billion over the coming financial years. This will have a tremendous impact for families in my community of Lindsay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is about delivering better health outcomes for local people, and one such example is telehealth. Since telehealth was introduced, 61.8 million services have been delivered to over 14.1 million patients, with $3.1 billion in benefits paid. Over 84,000 practitioners have now used telehealth services, and this has enabled almost 100,000 people in my electorate of Lindsay to access telehealth services during the pandemic. This is truly remarkable. As part of the budget, we've extended telehealth services until the end of the year, because we recognise the impact it has on ensuring more people and families in my community and right across Australia can access the care and support they need as we continue to navigate the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government are also ensuring that patients in my electorate of Lindsay have access to modern medical procedures and treatments. We've committed over $711 million in funding for new and amended Medicare listings to improve health and wellbeing outcomes. The Morrison government have overseen record levels of GP bulk-billing rates; the rate for this year, up to March, is 88.7 per cent. This is compared to a bulk-billing rate of 82 per cent when Labor were last in government. The importance of guaranteeing the services that Australians rely on has only grown during the coronavirus pandemic, and we have responded to the needs of people in our communities throughout the pandemic to adapt and provide the best services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also making a record investment in women's health in this year's budget. When I wrote to women in my community about what matters most to them, so many of them wrote back to me about women's health. The Morrison government's $350 million package for women's health will go towards perinatal mental health; addressing the rates of preterm birth; breast and cervical cancer screening programs; and endometriosis. This will make such an important difference to the lives of women and their families in my electorate of Lindsay, helping them through difficult times with life-changing and life-saving treatments and medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to guaranteeing the essential health services that Australians rely on when they need them most, both now and into the future. The Minister for Health and Aged Care came to Lindsay and helped me launch my Lindsay Healthy Active Living Network. Like me, he knows how important Western Sydney is and he shares my passion for encouraging healthy active living. I am very committed to making sure my community is an even better place to live, work and stay healthy. We are working on important health initiatives from improving our mental health services—I'm so pleased that we have a mental health hub coming into Penrith—to tackling really serious issues around childhood obesity, which in the electorate of Lindsay is higher than the state average. I am very much committed to addressing that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's plan guarantees the essential services that families in my electorate of Lindsay rely on, and that is absolutely essential. Could the minister please outline what new listings the Morrison government has funded in this year's budget, what the GP bulk-billing rate means for people in my electorate of Lindsay, how important telehealth has been for my community and right across Australia, and the important measures that were funded in our $354 million women's health package?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  We've had a very wide range of issues and questions raised for the minister today, and I thank him for being present and doing his best to answer those questions. I want to focus on aged care. If we are honest, the way the Morrison government has responded to aged care is entirely symptomatic of its whole eight years of government: it only seems to act when it has it's back to a wall; it only acts to fix political problems and then, all too often, its response is too little too late. After eight years of neglect the Morrison government had to call a royal commission—effectively into its own handling of aged care. After the incredibly hard work of the royal commission—months of work, in fact—and 148 recommendations it's clear to everyone that the government's response falls short of solving a number of key issues within the sector and fails to deliver enduring improvements and reforms for the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that it has accepted or accepted in principle 126 of the royal commission's 148 recommendations. But even when they say they've fully accepted a recommendation it doesn't actually mean they're going to implement it in full. When you look at the details in their response, times are pushed back, sometimes by years, and key sections of recommendations are often excluded. Sometimes they say they have accepted a recommendation, and their response doesn't even pretend to match it. That's a weird definition of 'accept'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the key areas of concern—firstly, staffing levels and minutes of care. In recommendation 86 the minimum staff time standard for residential care sets out two phases of mandatory minimum care minutes in residential aged care. The first phase mandates a minimum of 200 total care minutes per resident per day, but not until July 2022. The second phase increases this to 215 total care minutes by July 2024. The second phase also includes an all-important requirement to have a registered nurse on site 24/7. So why is the government only implementing the first phase or stage of this recommendation? Why have they ignored the second phase and the crucial step of having a registered nurse on site 24/7? Can the minister explain how the government has accepted this recommendation when only actually doing half of it? Secondly, we know that nothing will change without reform to the workforce, yet there was nothing in the budget to improve wages for overstretched, undervalued aged-care workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While answering a question at question time on Thursday 13 May, in response to a question about whether the government have a plan to increase aged-care workers' wages, the minister said: 'In relation to this there is $3.2 billion which goes to the $10-a-day uplift fee and that will flow through to our staff. This is absolutely directly about wages; $3.2 billion which goes to the ability to provide additional support to our personal care workers and for our nurses. That's how they're paid. They aren't paid directly by government; they're paid by people who employ them. That is providing support to the employers to support the employee.' How will this money actually increase the wages of workers? How will the minister ensure that it does flow through to staff? Is there actually a plan or no plan to increase workers' wages? What measure is there to ensure that providers use this money for wages? Is there any mechanism to enforce this? The royal commission clearly stated that the wages of aged-care workers were too low. It's clear that we won't be able to attract the workers needed to fill demand until this issue is resolved. What is the government doing to raise aged-care workers' wages so they're fairly and justly recognised for the hard work that they do?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on vaccinations, we're almost four months into the government's vaccine rollout strategy and still less than three per cent of Australians have been fully vaccinated. The latest advice from ATAGI and the impact on the AstraZeneca rollout will be yet a further brake on this desperately slow, desperately behind vaccine rollout strategy. This is particularly an issue for aged-care workers. Can the minister confirm that only 11 per cent of the aged-care workforce are fully vaccinated? And what is the government's plan to ensure that this critical workforce will have their vaccinations without them having to go on their own to their GP?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I want to thank all of the members who have spoken in consideration in detail and I appreciate their contributions. I think there are four remaining areas to be addressed, if I'm fair:  Medicare and hospitals, aged care, Australia's COVID response and Indigenous care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Medicare, hospitals and the number of Australians who are able to access the doctor without having to pay for it, during our time in government the bulk-billing rate for general practices—and bulk-billing represents somebody who is able to visit the doctor without having to pay—has increased from 82 per cent to 88.7 per cent. For the people of Lindsay, that means that, on average, if you take the national average, 6.7 per cent more of visits are free. It means that almost nine out of 10 visits are free. The year-to-date rate represents a significant step forward: 6.7 per cent greater than it was at any time under the previous government. Related to that, Medicare funding has reached record levels: going from $19 billion under the previous government to $31 billion, $32 billion and $33 billion over the course of this budget cycle, including an additional $6 billion all up for Medicare and an additional $700 million specifically for new Medicare items.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hospital funding—and this question was raised by the member for Macarthur—goes from $13 billion, under the previous government, and is more than doubled to $26 billion, $27 billion and $28 billion over the course of the forward estimates. Very importantly, related to that, we have also seen the change in private health insurance fees halved on an annual basis, from six per cent under Labor to just over 2.7 per cent under the coalition. It's the lowest change in 20 years. Over the last five years it has progressively been the lowest change in 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to aged care, at the outset I set out the five pillars, but I will address matters raised by the members for Perth, Longman and Cooper. The most fundamental thing here is a $17.7 billion investment and transformation in aged care. Part of that is $7½ billion for home care, including $6½ billion for additional home-care places, as we build towards a single support-at-home program. There is $7.8 billion which goes directly into residential aged-care investment. As the member for Cooper has said, $3.2 billion is for the basic daily fee, which goes to support the operations of facilities, patients and workers—all of those things flow from that investment. It is then immediately added to the new investment of $3.9 billion under the AN-ACC system for the work that is done to support care minutes. Those care minutes are all about the employment of workers—nurses and personal carers—to provide that care. It is a fundamentally important step forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to COVID, there has been some comparison with the UK and the US. Tragically, in the UK over 127,000 lives have been lost. In the US well over 600,000 lives have been lost. These figures are almost incomprehensible. If Australia were to have had the developed-world average, we would have had approximately 30,000 lives lost. If we were to have had the per capita rate of those two countries, we would have had 50,000 lives lost. I thank and acknowledge Australians. More than 26 per cent of eligible Australians have participated in the vaccine rollout so far. We urge them to continue. Over 6½ million Australians have been vaccinated, 100 per cent of aged-care facilities have had first doses and over 97.8 per cent of facilities have had second doses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, with regard to Indigenous Australians, $4 billion over the forward estimates goes specifically to their needs, with $781 million new. To answer the member for Lingiari, the funding in relation to Maningrida has been transferred to local community control, and I am advised they are now able to deliver the services.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Australia's economy is recovering quickly from the pandemic, with more Australians in work than ever before and job advertisements at their highest level in 12 years. The Morrison government wants all Australians to share in the opportunities created by our economic recovery. We understand that this means providing extra support for those within our community who face additional challenges and barriers. The Social Services portfolio measures in the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2021-22 being considered today will deliver an unprecedented boost to services supporting some of the most vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than $10 billion has been committed in the 2021-22 budget for new initiatives. These will work towards our commitment to protect the most vulnerable Australians now and into the future. This is on top of the base funding for the portfolio—resourcing for the Department of Social Services is a staggering $131 billion in 2021-22 alone. This represents a historic expansion of support and recognises that safety and security are more important than ever. The measures include a historic package to address women's safety and security—a very high priority in the budget. They include a national early childhood program for children with disability and improvements to the National Redress Scheme. There's also $9 billion for a series of permanent changes to strengthen the social security safety net and ensure jobseekers have the best opportunity to secure employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the big year-on-year increase to the rate of unemployment benefit since 1986, the base rate of working-age payments such as JobSeeker has been increased by $50 a fortnight as part of these extraordinary changes. This additional and ongoing support will assist income support recipients as they transition back into the workforce. The income-free area for working-age payments has been bolstered to $150 per fortnight to support jobseekers as they secure employment. These permanent changes strike the right balance between support for those Australians in need and incentives to return to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes also come on top of the unprecedented level of economic support provided to Australians to assist them through the coronavirus pandemic, including the coronavirus supplements and the economic support payments. The Morrison government's economic support payments alone benefited 5.1 million Australians who were in receipt of the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment or veterans payment or who were concession card holders. In total, these payments provided $12 billion in additional assistance to Australian households, above and beyond these recipients' regular payments. On top of these payments, the 2021 budget is further supporting retired Australians with a package of reform to enhance the pension loan scheme, providing pensioners and self-funded retirees with access to lump sum payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also provides enhanced support for those on the cashless debit card through an economic and employment support services package for the first four CDC program sites. The cashless debit card delivers on the Morrison government's commitment to ensure that social security recipients have access to the best technology to manage their money and overcome social harm. Under the package, $30 million will be allocated to establish a jobs fund and job-ready initiatives under an economic and employment support services package to create employment opportunities for individuals residing in those sites. The CDC support services for employment, as well as funding for rehab facilities, will also be bolstered. This support complements that provided by the cashless debit card in reducing access to products that can cause social harm. Data collection arrangements and community engagement for the cashless debit card will also be improved. Further, the extension for place based income management to 31 December 2023 provides certainty and support for around 2,500 vulnerable Australians in 12 sites. It offers participants assistance to build their budgeting skills and ensures the needs of individuals and families are met from the safety net provided by income support payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the comeback in Australia's economy is well underway, we know we'll continue to confront challenges. During the pandemic, the government stood side by side with all Australians, and we'll continue to support Australians as they look for work and the economy recovers. These and other measures form a comprehensive social services package to support Australians faced with challenges and barriers, as well as to secure our economic recovery.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  The past year has reminded all Australians of the importance and the value of our social security system. It exists and functions to ensure that Australians can live with dignity, no matter their employment status, their age or whether they or a loved one have a disability. Australians understand that life can be random and unpredictable. You never know when one day you may need a bit of extra help, and Labor will always seek to strengthen and improve our social security system. Our pensioners have worked hard and contributed all their lives. They deserve respect, and they deserve to live with dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, over the past year this government has either cut or tried to cut the pension. In 2015, they did a deal with the Greens that saw 370,000 pensioners receive $12,000 less a year. In 2014, they cut $1 billion out of the pensioner concessions. They have spent five of the last eight years trying to increase the pension age to 70, and just last year they were caught trying to freeze the pension by refusing indexation. The short-changing of pensioners by this government continues on the unreasonably high deeming rates. While the reserve cash rate is 0.1 per cent, this government continues to maintain an upper deeming rate of 2.25 per cent. My first question for the government is: why is the government pushing pensioners into risky investments by short-changing them with this unreasonably high pension deeming rate?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card the minister has referred to is something that we understand very well. It insinuates that Australians looking for work have chosen unemployment. The news is in: the cashless debit card has not changed behaviour in the trial sites. Labor will fight the cashless debit card every chance we get. We don't think quarantining 80 per cent of a social security payment and having, in some cases, the capacity for 100 per cent is right. My second question to the government: is why won't the government come clean about its secret plan to roll out the cashless debit card nationally? It is perfectly obvious that there is a working group with the big banks and the payment systems. Why does that exist if there is not going to be an expansion?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, today I want to speak about the Redress Scheme, something that is fundamental to the work that we do in parliament and an enormously important Labor legacy. One of the major programs the Department of Social Services has been the administrator of is the National Redress Scheme.  It follows the royal commission into institutional child sexual abuse and the national apology to survivors. This nation made a commitment to deliver redress—redress that is timely, redress that does not retraumatise, redress that survivors can have confidence in. The royal commission estimated that 60,000 survivors would be eligible for redress. As of 26 March 2021, three years after the scheme commenced, only 5,266 applications have been finalised. It is clear that too many survivors have been left waiting or are missing out altogether. Too many applications remain in limbo as institutions named in applications for redress refuse to do the right thing and join the scheme. Some elderly or terminally ill survivors have died without receiving redress and survivors are seeing their payments being chipped away by a low cap, are seeing the indexation of prior payments and are being pushed into the costly and lengthy court systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February Labor moved a suite of amendments to get the scheme more effectively delivering for survivors, to collect contributions from institutions refusing to join the scheme, for governments to act as funders of last resort, for an early payment scheme and to lift the cap on payments to reshape the assessment framework. My final questions to the government are: Will the government commit to these amendments to get the scheme back on track? When will it release its legislated two-year review?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the consideration in detail for the Social Services portfolio and the working-age payments and Pension Loans Scheme. The Morrison government is investing more than $9 billion in the 2021-22 budget to strengthen the social security safety net to ensure support is there for those who need it most. It's especially important at this time when so many Australians have been through such difficulties and changes in their circumstances. We have already legislated a package of measures that permanently increases the base rates and income-free areas of working-age payments, including JobSeeker. From 1 April 2021 the base rate of these working-age payments was increased by $50 a fortnight and the income-free area for JobSeeker payment and youth allowance was increased to $150 per fortnight. Australians without access to paid leave who are required to quarantine, self-isolate or care for someone as a result of COVID-19 can also continue to access income support under those measures. The increases for working-age payments strike the right balance between support for people who need it and incentives for people to take up work. Approximately 1.9 million working-age-payment recipients are already benefiting from these measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At home in Moncrieff on the Gold Coast, at the height of the pandemic, there were over 15,000 in my community who received the JobSeeker coronavirus supplement, and now that number has fallen to 10,158 people on JobSeeker payments who will continue to benefit from this historic increase. There are almost 2,000 students in my electorate who will also benefit from the increase in support, as well as over 1,500 single parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the biggest year-on-year increase to the rate of unemployment benefits since 1986, when I was about 17, and it has been delivered under this government, the Morrison government. It's also the largest-ever budget measure in respect of working-age payments. The pandemic caused a once-in-a-lifetime disruption to the labour market, and, while the comeback in Australia's economy is already underway, we know we'll continue to confront more challenges ahead. During the pandemic we have stood side by side with all Australians, and these new permanent arrangements continue to make good on that commitment to supporting Australians as they look for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is also improving the Pension Loans Scheme to increase its flexibility and make it more attractive to Australians of pension age. We want our older Australians to enjoy greater financial independence and quality of life. The Pension Loans Scheme is a reverse-mortgage loan product. It allows Australians of pension age to unlock the equity in their home to generate additional retirement income. Participation in the scheme is voluntary and participants have complete discretion as to how they spend their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2022, Pension Loans Scheme recipients will benefit from a no-negative-equity guarantee and access to capped advance payments. We're also introducing a campaign to raise awareness of the scheme. The no-negative-equity guarantee means participants will not have to repay more than the market value of their secured Australian property. Up to two lump-sum advances in any 12-month period will be accessible for recipients, up to a total value of 50 per cent of the maximum annual rate of age pension. Based on current rates, lump-sum payments of up to around $12,385 per year would be available for singles and up to around $18,670 for couples. As highlighted by the retirement income review, drawing on a small portion of home equity can substantially improve the retirement outcomes for older Australians. The changes to the scheme will give our older Australians more choice and more options to enjoy their life in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is giving a leg-up to all those Australians who need extra help with our safety net, whilst also balancing taxpayer contributions to our great liberal democracy. My question to the minister is: can you advise how many older Australians could benefit from these changes to the Pension Loans Scheme?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  My question to the minister is: what is this government doing to ensure that older Australian women—the fastest growing cohort of homeless people—aren't forced into homelessness because of housing affordability issues and, in particular, the enormous rise in rental costs across this country but also in my electorate of Dunkley? I have been contacted by many, many locals who are concerned because they can't get into the housing market, or their children can't, and are absolutely petrified because they are currently in rental accommodation, have been asked to leave—because landlords want to sell those properties because of the extreme rise in value of houses across the country and in my electorate as well—and can't find anywhere else to rent that they can afford. These constituents are predominantly single parents. A huge proportion of them are women who have fled violent or controlling relationships, or whose marriages have broken down and in the divorce the matrimonial house has been sold, and they are left with children. They are not able to buy back into the housing market and are relying on renting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the minister concerned that the rental assistance provided by his government and his department isn't going to be able to assist these people and people like them to be able to live in safe and secure accommodation? Given that Anglicare Australia's recently released <span style="font-style:italic;">Rental </span><span style="font-style:italic;">affordability s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">napshot</span> reveals that in the last 12 months there has been a massive drop in the number of affordable places for working families to rent, is the minister working on anything to address this struggling cohort of often hardworking but socioeconomically deprived Australians who can't find a place to live that they can afford? A year ago, 22 per cent of rental properties were affordable for two parents both working full-time on the minimum wage with two young kids. Now it's only 14 per cent of those types of families who can afford a rental property. How is a single parent supposed to be able to afford to rent, let alone buy a home?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, housing affordability across Australia has declined with the proportion of income required to meet loan repayments increasing to 34.7 per cent, according to the latest Real Estate Institute of Australia quarterly <span style="font-style:italic;">Housing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ffordability </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span>. We know there is no simple or single solution to improving housing affordability, but why is it that this minister and this government have ignored one of the biggest answers that we have: an investment in social and affordable housing? There are more people on social housing waiting lists than ever before. The wait lists continue to grow. People in my electorate contact me. They are on the disability support pension or are single parents and they are on 20-year waiting lists for social and public housing. There is less public housing today that there was 10 years ago. The percentage of social housing as a proportion of all national housing stock also continues to decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why won't the minister and this government follow Labor's policy to create a $10 billion off-budget housing Australia future fund? It will build social and affordable housing now and into the future, and it's good for the people in our community who just want safe and secure housing for themselves, for their children and for their retirement, and it's good for the economy. Given the statistics show that the program for the early release of super has hit low-income women particularly hard, and there are so many now who don't have superannuation because they have withdrawn all of it or all of it bar $1,000, what is the minister and this government going to do to make sure that those women aren't retiring into poverty and homelessness like so many others?</span>

                    <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I thank members of this House for their statements, which I'm pleased to respond to. The member for Moncrieff asked about older Australians benefiting from changes to the Pension Loans Scheme and how many older Australians could benefit from changes to this scheme in this year's budget. I am pleased to advise that any Australian of age pension age can benefit from the Pension Loans Scheme, subject to how much equity they have in Australian real estate, if they choose to use it. This is because the scheme, which is a reverse-mortgage loan product, is not just available for pensioners and part-pensioners but also for self-funded retirees. Age pension recipients can combine their pension payments with the loan amounts provided by the scheme up to a total of 150 per cent of the maximum rate of age pension. On the other hand, self-funded retirees can receive the whole 150 per cent of the maximum rate of age pension as a loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Participation in the scheme is voluntary and participants have complete discretion as to how they spend their money. Since the reduction in the scheme's interest rate in January this year, participant members have more than doubled. At the end of March, there were over 4,000 older Australians participating. We're also introducing a campaign to raise awareness of the scheme so that more Australians of age pension age are aware of the options available to them. As the member for Moncrieff has stated, these changes mean that older Australians will be provided with more choice to enjoy their life in retirement. The Retirement Income Review has shown that, by tapping into a small proportion of their home equity, older Australians could substantially improve their retirement incomes. I'm particularly proud of the way the government have supported pensioners in the way in which we're delivering for older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the member for Barton's questions about pensioners on the cashless debit card, let me be absolutely clear on the government's policy: we have no such plan and never have had such a plan. The cashless debit card is for those Australians on working-age payment to help stabilise their lives, become job ready and get back into the workforce. Overwhelmingly, Australians in Cape York were excited that they could use the cashless debit card when they travelled to Cairns, Townsville or wherever else they might go. One issue that has been raised a number of times concerns the amount of misinformation—much of it perpetuated by those opposite, unfortunately. Any campaign aimed at suggesting that age pensioners will be moving in this direction is patently and utterly wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I respond to the member for Dunkley on the issue of affordable housing. Social housing has and always has been the responsibility of state governments—any failing in social housing is a failure of state governments period—notwithstanding the federal government's intervention through programs such as NHFIC, which has sought to put over $1 billion into the community housing sector to assist. It's also important the member for Dunkley understands that the federal government spends over $5 billion per annum in Commonwealth rent assistance, on top of other primary payments. Likewise, we've increased the base rate of unemployment benefits for the first time in 35 years. That's the first time since there have been five Labor prime ministers and four Liberal prime ministers. It's this government that has put more money into the base rate of unemployment and more money into Commonwealth rental assistance than any government in living memory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also respond to another question asked by the member for Barton in terms of the National Redress Scheme. I acknowledge her heartfelt interest in the scheme and the requirement and desire for the scheme to do better. The scheme recognises that survivors of institutional child sexual abuse have been waiting for a long time for redress. I think we all acknowledge the enduring pain of survivors and their families who are waiting for resolution. No scheme is perfect; not this one, not any one. There is always trauma in coming forward. But the government is working hard to ensure that every institution with a history of working with young people joins the scheme to ensure all survivors who come forward can access redress. Institutions will be able to join throughout the life of the scheme, maximising access to redress for survivors. If institutions named in applications do not join the scheme, they will be publicly named, will become ineligible for Commonwealth grant funding and may be stripped of their charitable status.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I thank the shadow minister for families and social services for allowing me to ask some questions of the minister on behalf of constituents in my electorate. I look forward to the minister's reply. I was contacted not so long ago now by a young woman, a mum, named Bianca. I was absolutely surprised, almost beyond belief, at what Bianca told me. Of course there are the cashless debit card trials—and I want to make it crystal clear that Labor will scrap the cashless debit card—but never in a million years did I think anyone in the electorate of Gilmore would be impacted, because we're not a trial site. How wrong was I?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bianca, now residing in my electorate, originally lived in Bundaberg for several years. However, Bianca moved to Brisbane to escape domestic violence. While living in Brisbane, Bianca was placed on the cashless debit card in July 2019. Not long after, Bianca moved to Sydney and was unfortunately hit by a car, and then had a carer due to her permanent injuries. When Bianca was in hospital after being hit by the car, Bianca tells me she could not use the cashless debit card to pay for the TV to be connected, because it sold gambling products. In November 2020, Bianca complained to Centrelink about being on the cashless debit card because she went to pay for a meal in a bistro and, because they sold alcohol at the venue, she was not able to pay for her meal. Bianca said it would take up to two weeks for her rent payments to be cleared by the cashless debit card hotline, so she was constantly behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bianca's complaint resulted in an investigation into Bianca's previous leases, and it was discovered that Bianca was not living in Bundaberg, the trial site for the card, at the time of the cashless debit card rollout. Bianca was then told she had been placed on the cashless debit card in error, and she was subsequently taken off the cashless debit card. But this terrible story does not end there. Now residing in my electorate, Bianca got a phone call from Services Australia saying that she had been taken off in error and had now been placed back onto the card, with no explanation. Bianca's carer also tried speaking with Services Australia and could not get any answers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bianca is afraid that she will not be able to pay for things, because 80 per cent of her payment goes onto the card and she only gets 20 per cent in cash. She is also worried that when she buys her groceries at Aldi, if they have only one register open and it sells alcohol, she will not be able to buy her groceries. Bianca says she has a large bust and her bras cost a lot of money. She can get the ones she needs on eBay, but, because they sell alcohol, they are not an approved seller. To purchase her bras, she must first seek approval from Indue and provide photographs of what she wants to buy. Then, if approved, she must provide proof of purchase. Bianca said it is humiliating to have to get approval to buy her underwear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bianca said she fled a domestic violence situation because her partner would restrict her access to money. Bianca tells me it appears that the government is now doing exactly the same thing. So, as Bianca's federal member, I worked to have Bianca permanently removed from the cashless debit card. I am assured this has now happened. I am told that every Centrelink or Services Australia office has spare cashless debit cards. Here I was, thinking it was limited to the trial sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have three questions to the minister: No. 1, how many people are on the cashless debit card in the electorate of Gilmore; No. 2, how many people across Australia who reside outside the trial sites are on the cashless debit card; and, No. 3, given the high number of pensioners in my electorate, can the minister rule out completely that pensioners will be put onto the cashless debit card?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  Everyone deserves to be safe—safe in their homes, their schools, their workplaces and their communities. But, sadly, we know this isn't always the case. This is particularly important for people in my electorate of Lindsay, an area that experiences higher rates of domestic violence than the New South Wales state average. Between April 2020 and March this year, the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research measured domestic violence assaults in Penrith at nearly 614 per 100,000 population. This is significantly higher than the New South Wales state average over the same period, 395.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm working closely with Penrith Women's Health Centre to ensure we have the services in our community for women and their families when they need them most. We really must continue to support these on-the-ground services, who work incredibly hard to support women and children in our community. That's why I delivered funding for two specialist domestic violence caseworkers at Penrith Women's Health Centre. In speaking with the staff at the centre and the women they support, I have seen firsthand the difference this has made, increasing the availability and accessibility of services. When I have written and spoken to women in my community about this issue, so many have shared their own personal experiences and stories, including very distressing and devastating stories. It shows how important this work is and how much we must support it to continue, particularly in a community like mine, where the rates of domestic violence are significantly higher than average. Our local police know how important this issue is, and we're working together on how we can tackle some of these critical issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government also takes the safety of Australian women and families incredibly seriously. Our $1 billion Women's Safety Package is contributing to the target of ending violence against women and children. This is a historic, record investment in the safety of women across Australia, and as part of this package we're investing $600 million in this year's budget across 16 new women's safety measures. Among the initiatives is a new two-year funding agreement where the Morrison government will commit $260 million to partner with states and territories to boost local frontline services and trial new initiatives in the transition to the next National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. The funding is on top of the $130 million provided to states during the COVID-19 pandemic and the $340 million under the fourth action plan as well as the investment from state governments. This combined effort acknowledges the work of frontline services in tackling domestic violence and allows us to trial innovative initiatives and focus on prevention, early intervention and perpetrator responses. Our Women's Safety Package also provides support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. We have over 6,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate of Lindsay, so I'm particularly passionate about ensuring that they've got the best support possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Preventing and responding to violence against women and children is a shared responsibility of all governments—of everyone in society, actually—and it's why we're working with the states to provide this historic level of funding. We recognise that the impacts of the pandemic on women's safety and that there continues to be demand for support from frontline family, domestic and sexual violence services, just like at Penrith Women's Health Centre, and we're committed to removing the barriers and streamlining support for people escaping domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another program, Stop it at the Start, aims to break the cycle of violence by encouraging adults to reflect on their own attitudes and have conversations about respect with young people aged 10 to 17 years. This message needs to get through every sector of society. Violence against women is not acceptable under any circumstances. I'll continue to work closely with my local organisations in Lindsay and to support them where I can. Along with the measures I've just highlighted, could the minister advise what further programs the Morrison government is committing to in the 2021-22 budget to secure women's safety—particularly those programs helping women leave violent situations?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  It's quite serendipitous that I follow the member for Lindsay here today, because I too have questions about the government's commitment to women, particularly those fleeing family and domestic violence as well as more broadly. But I want to start by focusing on domestic and family violence. While we accept that there are some good measures in the budget for women, let's not forget that this is a government for whom women's safety and security only became a thing after their own disastrous record was revealed. The first budget statement on women was revealed in the previous budget, and one wonders why it has taken so long for this government to recognise that women's safety and security as well as a number of issues for women need to have a specific focus within the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to family and domestic violence, of course we welcome any additional funding for women's safety. I know that in my own electorate of Cowan the services that are on the front line, helping women leave family and domestic violence situations, are absolutely inundated. Last week I met with Broken Crayons Still Colour, which helps women to get out or flee family and domestic violence. They have had a 50 per cent increase in the number of women that they have had to help, and they are staffed solely by volunteers. They get absolutely no funding from the government. Similarly, No Limits, within my electorate, has been recognised with several community awards for the work that they do in helping women flee violence and helping them get back on their feet after fleeing family and domestic violence. Again, they are inundated with requests from women and children leaving domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week in this House I spoke about a case in Cowan of a woman who fled a domestic violence situation with her four children, one of whom has severe autism, and was turned away by a service provider because there simply was no room. She had to return to her abuser, who allows her to stay in the house during the day to look after the children and at night turfs her out to sleep in the local park. Our office and some of the charities in the area were able to provide her with a sleeping bag and some blankets to keep her warm at night. She has to drive 20 minutes to go to the nearest bathroom. And she's not alone in that situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before COVID-19, the government's own figures suggested that almost 10,000 women and children would be fleeing domestic violence or turned away from shelters. We know that number has increased. So my question to the minister is: why has it taken eight years for the government to realise that we have a crisis here for family and domestic violence accommodation? Fifteen years ago, when I was a volunteer for a family and domestic violence organisation, I wrote a report on a needs analysis for women fleeing domestic violence. That report was called <span style="font-style:italic;">No place to go</span>. Today, I have agencies asking for that report and quoting that report, because there is still no place to go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget sets aside $29.3 million to improve migrant and refugee women's safety over the next three years, but there is $464 million to bolster immigration detention. Let me put that into perspective for everyone here. That is 15 times more money to lock up women and children than to help set them free. Why has the government underinvested in helping women and children flee domestic and family violence, given the scale of the epidemic that we have in this country? We know that First Nations women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of domestic violence. Why hasn't the government made an investment that meets the scale of this problem? Like I said, any funding is welcome, but it is simply not enough. Can the government please explain how it came up with the level of funding to put into family and domestic violence given the scale of the problem and given the specific increases in the issue with COVID-19? Why doesn't the funding match the scale of the issue? I'm a little concerned that it's all too little too late, which happens to be a hallmark of this government, just as with its Women's Budget Statement. I would like the minister to answer those questions specifically. I would like to know where the funding is that actually addresses and meets the scale of this problem. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I thank the member for Lindsay specifically and other members for their questions and the points they have made. The member for Lindsay has specifically asked what further measures the government is investing in to secure women's safety. I'm pleased to advise her that the 2021-22 budget provides unprecedented funding towards ending violence against women and children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The priority of the Morrison government has always been keeping Australians safe—safe in their home, safe at work and safe in our communities. Working towards this goal, we are focused on making Australia a place that is free from violence against women and children. The funding committed in the budget is the federal government's single-largest investment in women's safety and domestic violence support in history, across any government. The billion dollar Women's Safety Package includes a $600 million investment in women's safety measures under the Social Services portfolio that contribute to the 'towards zero' target, forming part of the measures considered today in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2021-2022. As the member for Lindsay has highlighted, these measures build on the work of the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children and the funding committed through COVID to assist frontline services. This historic budget funding is a down payment for the future. It ensures a seamless transition to a new national plan to end violence against women and children, which will commence in July next year but looks at issues faced today and builds a base for new and emerging issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the package we are also providing funding of $12.6 million for five additional projects under the safe places initiative. These projects will provide emergency accommodation for women and children escaping violence in regional and remote communities. We want women to know they have somewhere safe to go when they make a brave decision to escape violent situations. Women and children in regional and remote communities in particular face specific challenges, especially when they're not able to stay with family and friends. The new emergency accommodation created by these projects will not only give women and children a safe place to stay but also provide access to specialist family and domestic violence services to help them get back on their feet. These projects build on the $600 million commitment announced in September last year to the safe places program, which will help around 6,000 women and children each year to escape violence. The additional funding is expected to help a further 450 women and children annually. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also investing a further $164.8 million to establish the new escaping violence payment. The government are committed to breaking down all the barriers to women leaving violent relationships, and we recognise that financial dependence or isolation can be one of the largest barriers for women to overcome. This two-year pilot program addresses the significant barrier to women leaving a violent relationship. The payment will provide women with $5,000 in financial support to help women escape violent relationships as they establish a home free from violence. This support includes up to $1,500 in immediate cash, with the remaining amount available for goods and services such as rental bonds, school fees, whitegoods, car rego and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed to continually improving the National Redress Scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, as I have said previously this afternoon. This year's budget includes a further investment in the scheme which will provide for initial and immediate action in response to the two-year review of the program. Importantly it will help ensure the scheme remains survivor focused. These measures are among 16 new women's safety initiatives that will ensure a seamless transition to a new plan to reduce violence against women and children.</span>

It operates throughout the payments network, the EFTPOS network, which has over one million outlets. It can be used at pubs, clubs and restaurants to buy meals and non-alcoholic drinks—it can be used at pubs, clubs and restaurants. To confirm what I have already said once today—I will reconfirm it because apparently it is having trouble sinking in on the other side—there is no plan for it to be moved to pensions; it is for a working-age payment only.

I thought I had lost you when I moved. It's good to see you back. The NDIS, as we all know, is a world first that all Australians justifiably should be proud of and was introduced with bipartisan support. The Morrison government is ensuring Australians can receive vital supports and services by investing a staggering $13.2 billion extra into the world-leading NDIS in the 2021-22 budget—$13.2 billion. The Morrison government has always said it is committed to funding the NDIS as a demand driven scheme, and this is reflected in more than $17 billion in additional funding in the last two budgets alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2021-22 budget also makes a significant investment in enhancements to the care and support workforce and improving the way government services are accessed and delivered, particularly for Australians living remotely. We are also delivering the NDIS and making sure it is equitable and affordable for Australians today and tomorrow. The government intends to introduce reforms based on creating a fairer, respectful and more consistent NDIS. The government is committed to improving the NDIS in line with the vision embodied in the 2011 Productivity Commission report and supported by the 2019 Tune review. The NDIS is fully funded and demand driven, with 450,000 Australians now accessing life-changing supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to further improve the way Australians interact with the government online, over the phone or in person. The government has reaffirmed its commitment to quarantining essential services now and into the future by allocating $200 million to design and deliver an enhanced myGov over the next two years as a single front door into government for all citizens. Consequently, there are 18 remote service centres assisting people living in remote parts of Australia to access Medicare, Centrelink and child support payments and services. Last financial year Services Australia had 350 agents and 235 access points throughout regional, rural and remote Australia and will continue to step up to the plate in supporting Australians now and into the future.</span>

                    </a>  No wonder there's a homelessness crisis. My question is to my sparring colleague who was the Minister for the NDIS. I'll put background to the question. The government keep changing their justification to cut the NDIS. First of all, they came up with this concern about consistency and fairness. The Morrison government sprung on Australians a plan for independent assessments when it announced its response to the Tune review in August 2020. When people were shocked, the government claimed that the independent reviewer, David Tune AO, PSM had called for independent assessments to be introduced in order to fix issues with consistency and fairness. Labor agree that there are issues with consistency and fairness, but when Labor FOI'd the report we found that the government had inserted in the report the entire chapter and recommendation for independent assessments—perhaps it was not so independent a review with not so independent assessments. These assessments will be done by companies who not only are in cahoots with the government but also used to be the government, in the case of one of the companies. One company is linked to former NDIA CEO Robert De Luca and another company is led by a former Liberal MP, thus confirming the old cliche that this government has never seen a government opportunity that it hasn't sought to monetise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Consistency and fairness' still reverberates from the new minister, like a parrot of her predecessor, my friend Stuart Robert. The new minister has said, 'Your postcode absolutely determines your package.' You could be mistaken for thinking that the independent assessment is intended to increase NDIS funding for those who are missing out—communities whose first language is one other than English, First Nations communities and people in remote areas. But what this government really wants to do is reduce the packages for people who are able to navigate the NDIS bureaucracy well enough to get a decent level of support. In other words, the answer of this government to some people not accessing it is to have independent assessments which make it harder for everyone to access it—because misery loves a friend. This postcode discrimination issue isn't solved by making it harder for the people currently enjoying this world-class scheme to get the necessary supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government was caught out on consistency and fairness it went back to an old favourite of the antiwelfaremeisters and said this was about participant fraud. Minister Robert claimed that the NDIS needed to change because people with disability were scamming the system to get themselves yachts, jetties and other services, which he felt wouldn't pass the pub test. This came from an MP who famously claimed $38,000 for his home internet bill—there is nothing that NDIS participants couldn't learn from him! The NDIA have since confirmed that, out of a thousand fraud tip-offs made against 430,000-plus participants, none have revealed fraud from the participants. In too many cases the government assumes that, if you need government support to access a wheelchair, you must somehow be a malingerer. The fact that, as early as March this year, the former minister felt he needed to employ the welfare-cheat dog whistling to garner public support just shows how desperate they are to cut the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's third explanation for independent assessments is that it's unsustainable. Somehow the government thinks that aspiring to an ordinary life is too expensive. In terms of sustainability, my question is in several parts. How much is currently being spent by the NDIA on consultants? How many matters are currently in the backlog of cases appealing to the AAT? How long have these cases been waiting for a decision? How much of the NDIS's spending is on private sector lawyers to get through the AAT case load and why isn't it being handled in-house? How many positions are currently vacant in the NDIA's AAT branch? Is the minister aware of how much NDIS funding is currently being lost to fraud by shonky service providers? What is being done to combat systemic provider fraud? When will the government come clean on the NDIS costs and release their financial sustainability report and the modelling beneath it?</span>

It was introduced in a bipartisan way. In fact, we have members in the House who were the architects of this. We should really pay credit where credit is due. From the outset it was envisaged that the NDIS would support participants with permanent and significant disability to exercise control and choice over their life with a fair, flexible and consistent package of reasonable and necessary support. The need for the NDIS to remain affordable was also integral to that initial vision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 450,000 people with permanent and significant disability are now being supported by the NDIS. Incredibly, 50 per cent are receiving support for the very first time. This is an initiative that is being supported enthusiastically by those Australians who need it. We all want an Australia where disability doesn't limit the choices you have available but opens up possibilities for different ones and an Australia where disability doesn't limit what decisions you get to make about your life or require others to make those decisions for you, but there is evidence that the current approach to assessing a person's functional capacity is inadequate, leading to inconsistent and inequitable eligibility, planning and budgeting decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data also clearly shows that those with lower socioeconomic status on average have lower plan budgets than those with higher socioeconomic status, which suggests that those who have greater means have greater access to systems, assessments and reports. We don't want to see this. We don't want to see it depend on where you live as to how you get access. That is why the Morrison government is looking to ensure fairness and equity for all Australians with disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principles of the NDIS have always been that the government decides who gets the NDIS and how much they get and that the participant with the disability decides how they spend it. That is fair and equitable. As a result, the use of standardised objectively administered assessments is a core element of insurance based schemes such as this. In fact, in 2011 the Productivity Commission recommended the NDIA engage independent health professionals to undertake the assessments of those wanting to receive NDIS support. These are clear integrity measures to ensure a fair and equitable outcome for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission noted that, in order to promote independent outcomes, assessors should be drawn from an approved pool of allied health professionals and that, in order to reduce the potential for sympathy bias, they should be independent from the person they're assessing. Independent assessments will ensure the NDIA can gather more consistent and robust information to better understand how it can support participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to be sure that we can sustain the NDIS, not just now but into the future. I will say that parents of children with disabilities understand this very core. They understand that if we destroy the NDIS because it's out of control then we are going to destroy it for the future of these children. We need to make sure that we are fair, equitable and reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Updated forecasts suggest that there's going to be an increase to the 411,000 Australians between the ages of zero and 64 who would join the NDIS as modelled in 2011. Updated forecasts project 532,000 Australians will join the NDIS by June 2023. On the current trajectory, the NDIS is estimated to cost more than the MBS in just a few years time. We need to ensure that we have a scheme that can financially endure for many generations to come. We all want this. We all need this.</span>

She is listening carefully on this issue. We are engaging with providers, with those who are in the scheme and with the experts. The Morrison government is fully committed to ensuring the NDIS is here to support Australians for years to come. I thank the minister for meeting with us in Higgins to talk about this highly sensitive and very important topic and engaging with the sector, the providers and the participants to make sure that we can together provide great outcomes. Can the minister please provide an update on how the Morrison government is delivering a strong, skilled and sustainable NDIS workforce for now and into the future?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  My question is to the absent Minister for Homelessness, Social and Community Housing, who's supposed to be here right now answering questions but hasn't turned up. But we shouldn't be surprised, because this is a minister who doesn't do his job. This is a minister who has been in the job of minister for homelessness now for six months—or, to be exact, 181 days—and he's uttered the word 'homelessness' publicly on only six out of those 181 days. No wonder he won't turn up here to answer questions about what he's doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse than that, he even refuses to meet with organisations whose job is to help the homeless. This is a letter from Australia's peak homelessness organisation, National Shelter. It's a complaint to the Prime Minister about this absent minister. It's dated 21 April, and it says they've been 'unable to secure a meeting with the minister himself despite repeated requests'. Three weeks later, they got a response from the Prime Minister's office telling them, if the minister wouldn't meet with them, to try Minister Ruston. So two weeks ago we asked Minister Ruston in estimates, 'Were you aware that the Prime Minister had flicked this organisation to you?' She had no idea. But, to her credit, straight after estimates, her office picked up the phone, contacted National Shelter and organised a meeting. My question to the absent minister is: after 181 days in the job, why won't you meet with them? Why won't you do your job?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not the only ones being ignored by this absent minister. The head of Homelessness Australia can't get in the door. Why won't the minister meet with them? They've tried and they've been rejected. They've been refused entry. Here's another organisation: the Community Housing Industry Association, CHIA, a peak body for community housing organisations in Australia. This is another organisation that has tried to meet with this absent minister and been rejected. They have been refused a meeting. This is his job. It's part of his job to meet with organisations who are trying to reduce homelessness and give this government some ideas about what to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Heaven knows they could do with some ideas, because there are more people homeless in Australia today than ever before. In some parts of Australia, there are more people sleeping rough now than before COVID. Last year, 10,000 mums and kids fleeing domestic violence got turned away from refuges because there wasn't a bed—because the inn was full. That's 27 a night. It'll happen again tonight: another 27 mums fleeing in the middle of the night and getting turned away because there isn't room. Last financial year, 95,000 individuals got turned away from homelessness services in this country just because the services didn't have the resources they needed to help them. The people who are trying to help this minister fix it can't even get in to see him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever he gets asked about this, what's his answer? Unbelievably, he says it's not his job. He says it's the job of state governments. The name on the door is 'minister for homelessness'. Why does he even have the title 'minister for homelessness'? Why won't he have the guts to turn up here and answer these questions? Why on earth does he deserve to keep his job?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  Before I respond to the previous speaker, let me respond to the member for Maribyrnong, from Victoria, who spoke prior to that. The member for Maribyrnong would have you believe the government is doing all sorts of nefarious things. The member for Maribyrnong has more front than Myer. He is coming out and saying the government is cutting the NDIS, after $17 billion extra has been put in. I dare the member for Maribyrnong to find that level of estimates variation and increased expenditure across two budgets across any government program in living memory in Australia. There is none. Silence over there; as always, silence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also remind the member for Maribyrnong as to the reason for independent assessments. It came out of the 2011 Productivity Commission. John Walsh, appointed by the Labor government at the time—an excellent appointment; an incredible and deserving Australian; the father of the NDIS—is on the record as saying that independent assessments must go forward. I ask the member for Maribyrnong: do you disagree with your hand-picked member on the Productivity Commission?</span>

                    </a>  Sit down, son, I'll let you speak when the time's up. I refer to page 327 of the Productivity Commission report—and I know the member opposite hasn't read it, but I would encourage him to pull it out. I will read it for the member opposite, only because he won't actually read it himself and it is an inconvenient truth that the member doesn't like to look at. The Productivity Commission said, and I will quote it so there is no confusion:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to promote independent outcomes, assessors should be drawn from an approved pool of allied health professionals. Assessors should be independent of the person being assessed to reduce potential for sympathy bias. This means that health professionals, GPs and others with past treatment and support responsibilities for the person would not undertake assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission recommended independent assessments. The Tune review that followed recommended independent assessors. John Walsh, the father of the scheme—a very worthy appointment to the Productivity Commission, recommended by the Labor Prime Minister at the time—recommended independent assessments. But I guess it just doesn't stack up to what the member for Maribyrnong wants, which is just a political fight. I would encourage the member for Maribyrnong to put people with disability ahead of his own political ambitions and then we might get a better outcome.</span>

Let me thank the member for Higgins for all her hard work and what she has done, for her questions and for her ongoing work in supporting the NDIS. The member for Higgins is a qualified professional in her field and knows how important the work is that this government is doing, as opposed to the hack, the member for Maribyrnong, for whom it's just all politics and no expert knowledge.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 June in Perth, the Minister for the NDIS launched the national workforce plan. Data from the plan estimated that the NDIS workforce comprised 270,000 workers in 2019-20 and forecast an additional 83,000 workers will be required to service over half a million participants by June 2024. The new NDIS workforce plan is a comprehensive blueprint for today and tomorrow. It's designed to attract workers with suitable skills, values and attributes while also improving existing workers' access to training and development. We need Australians to have a much greater appreciation of the rewards and opportunities that working in this beautiful sector provides, as well as an understanding of the personal satisfaction that is gained through care and support careers. It is a message we need to reinforce at every opportunity and by every means at our disposal. To achieve this, we need more attractive entry pathways and better conditions. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SHORTEN:</span>
                    </a>  Yes, very wise. In terms of ongoing issues about government services and the NDIS, I have a little more on the NDIS question I had, which I did not get any answers to. The opposition is seeking that the government, who claim a massive financial crisis in the NDIS, release the NDIA's fiscal sustainability report and the underlying assumptions. I put the government on notice: if they fail to honour this request at this time, we will keep persisting to obtain this information, because if you have no evidence of a fire then don't call the fire brigade. The question we would furthermore suggest to help rebuild confidence in the NDIS is: will the minister agree to facilitate a meeting between me and the NDIA workforce so I can hear their concerns and observations?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put a little bit of background on government services. We are very concerned that in the last budget, whilst other departments were given greater resources or expanded, Services Australia resources were slashed and frozen. The budget amount for employees for 2021-22 is $330,931,000 less than the previous year, 2020-21. This figure continues to reduce by tens of millions each year in the forward estimates to 2024-25. The budget states that the ASL, or the mandated average staffing level, for Services Australia would go from 27,637 in 2020-21 to 26,838 in 2021-22. Apparently the work being done by the equivalent of 799 workers is simply going to disappear. Perhaps this is because the government has further plans to automate some of this work and has some new whiz-bang robodebt-style plan to replace the human workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, when it comes to departmental expenses, services to community, social security and welfare, they are reduced by 33 per cent per annum at the end of the forward estimates. This is a reduction of more than $3 billion. These cuts to Services Australia may just be a culture war fund for the government to attack the social services safety net, but, even if the government don't care about the workforce and the Public Service, they should be motivated to care about everyday Australians relying on them for a decent standard of service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the people who use Centrelink services are men and women growing older who have often given a lot to the nation and just require a little bit of kindness in their twilight years through the contract of a generous safety net. There are veterans I speak of who have fought in foreign fields for this country, jobseekers, people with disability and the vulnerable. These cuts that I've outlined come amidst an environment of uncertainty over the government's undeclared plan to close Centrelink shopfronts. Even if they don't close the shopfronts, it's just to strip out more people in the shopfronts to reduce services to people who don't wish to have their services provided online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of the Mornington, Newcastle, Tweed Heads, Yarra, Abbotsford and many other Centrelink offices is uncertain. Therefore, in light of these facts which are contained in the appropriations detail, these are the questions relating to government services: How will the existing workloads be dealt with, or what will be dropped due to funding cuts? What areas of work or serving the public will no longer require the funding of more than $3 billion, cut over the forwards? Will the government detail its plan to reduce the number of Centrelink shopfronts or the number of people working in them, or will it just give a straight-up guarantee it won't reduce the number of staff in Centrelink offices and won't reduce the number of Centrelink shopfronts? Furthermore, when we talk about government services, on Services Australia's role in supporting the vaccine certificate, how many people have had their COVID-19 vaccination certificate added to their online myGov or Medicare profiles, and what will be the average time from vaccination for this information to be available?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, there is one request by some Commonwealth public servants through me to their minister: does the government plan to cut the official government seal—which sits above, for example, their chair's desk—from Services Australia? Why is the government proposing to cut the official Commonwealth seal from Services Australia? Will it rule out doing this? Finally, would the minister agree to facilitate a meeting between me and the workforce at the various Centrelink offices as I travel around Australia to hear their concerns and thank them for their frontline work? The minister could come with me if he were so inclined to meet the frontline workforce of his department.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I'm proud to show my stripes today, wearing this beautiful scarf presented to me this morning by the members of Common Grace. I'm not much of a knitter myself, so I appreciate the delicate work and time that has gone into crafting it. This scarf has an important message to all of us. The pattern is based on the famous climate stripe graph developed by climatologist Ed Hawkins, and shows the long-term increase in average global temperatures from 1850 to 2019 using a progression from cooler temperatures, represented in blue, to warmer temperatures, represented with red. Sadly, we are heading in the wrong direction, with global temperatures expected to rise by over three degrees. We need to act.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a single creative piece of knitting, the warming of our planet is clear for all to see. Global warming will impact every aspect of our way of life, from our health, safety, jobs and economy to our environment. I thank the members of Common Grace for their passion in seeking change and for taking such a creative and unique approach to raising awareness of the need for climate action. I thank Catherine Valpani from Warringah, who so thoughtfully knitted the piece that I wear today. This is a call for action that brought me to this place. How we act now will undoubtedly be our legacy. Too many members in this place are focused on personal ambition. We need that to stop and to focus on our futures and our children.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I rise today to update the chamber on what the WA redistribution means for my electorate. From 2 August, O'Connor, not known for its lack of size, will get a whole lot bigger, expanding to an area of 1.13 million square kilometres. That's larger than Spain and France combined. This expansion is partly due to the addition of the Shire of Wiluna. The Wiluna community has strong connections to the northern Goldfields and the Ngaanyatjarra lands that fall entirely within the current electorate of O'Connor. So it's with great delight that I welcome Wiluna into my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look forward to representing the people of Boddington. While geographically distant from the Goldfields region, Boddington is home to Australia's largest gold mine and a large bauxite mining province. The inclusion of Boddington means O'Connor now houses most of WA's prime goldmining areas. Gold is not the only commodity produced in abundance by the people of my electorate. As a former farmer, I'm delighted the wheat belt shires of Beverley, Bruce Rock, Cunderdin, Kellerberrin, Koorda, Merredin, Mount Marshall, Mukinbudin, Narembeen, Nungarin, Quairading, Tammin, Trayning, Westonia, Wyalkatchem and Yilgarn will all come on board. WA regularly produces one-third of Australia's wheat and over 50 per cent of Australia's wheat exports. That's a lot of wheat and a lot of extra shires. With the addition, too, of the scenic South West Shire of Nannup, O'Connor will now stretch across 57 local government areas. That means it will encompass more local government areas than any other electorate in Australia, which serves to remind us that, no matter how big O'Connor gets, it's the local communities that matter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Over the weekend I visited two towns in my electorate, Trentham and Bullarto, at the heart of a region which was recently struck by frankly incredible storms. The winds uprooted 100-year-old trees, turning them into kindling; they tore roofs off houses, brought down powerlines and damaged towns' drinking water. Touring the region with the CFA and Hepburn Shire, frankly I was astonished that there hadn't been loss of life. It looked like parts of the Wombat forest had been completely clear-felled, and this is a forest that has not had logging for a long period of time. I know other members here have electorates that have been affected as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In talking to the SES, the CFA, Parks Victoria, DELWP and council officers, I heard how they began that night responding to calls, before being forced back to their sheds. It was just unsafe for them actually to be out. I heard of their utes being literally lifted off the road and having to brace against fallen trees just to stay safe. Even then, it took them hours to cut through roads to get to safety. So strong were the winds that they couldn't hear the sounds of the chainsaws that were in their own hands. Not only is it a miracle that no lives were lost but, in the middle of the night, a baby was born in Trentham. In the worst storm in a generation, the population went up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you so much to everybody in the community who looked after each other: Trentham, Blackwood, Barkstead, Bullarto, Greendale, Musk, Korweinguboora, Little Hampton, Lyonville and all of the towns across Hepburn and Moorabool shires. Our thoughts are with you today. We must make sure that we recover after this— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Each person had a shocking and frightening story about how they'd lost contact with their loved ones—parents, wives, husbands—and these loved ones had been detained by the Chinese government and interned in Xinjiang province for having travelled to other countries and so being accused of separatism. In reality, they are an ethnic minority and are being persecuted for being so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the people I met, most had neither heard from nor seen their loved ones in years. One man shared with me that his wife was pregnant when detained in 2017. Chinese authorities have now told him that she has no child with her. Another member of the delegation told me how her husband had been imprisoned for most of the last four years and has now been sentenced to 25 years in prison. In reality, he's a Uighur who once travelled to, and lived for a period in, Turkey. The woman's name is Mehray Mezensof, and she has taken the incredibly brave step of going public with her husband's story. She told me that she'd been quiet for four years, hoping that that would have a positive effect, but it has not.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have assured the delegation that this Australian government, along with other nations, will continue doing everything we can to hold the Chinese government to account for this brutal injustice.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Over the weekend I was privileged to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of the Centenary Rowing Club. This club is one of the largest rowing clubs in Queensland, having been founded in 2001 by Mr Russell Pool and Mr Peter Cook, as part of the Centenary Canoe and Rowing Club. Back then, this club's operations were run out of the back of the Jindalee Scout Hall and the club held meetings at the Mount Ommaney Library or members' houses. They had only one rowing boat, a tub pair, stored under black plastic in the grass, that was used on occasion when members wished to go for a social row. Well, how far they've come! Over the past 20 years this organisation has grown into a hugely successful club that has developed excellent rowers, who've had the opportunity to compete across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was incredibly privileged over the weekend to meet one of the club's stand-out rowers, Sophie Malcolm. Sophie recently won single scull at the Australian Rowing Championships in Tasmania, which was her third time on the podium. Representing Centenary Rowing Club, she took out gold for the under-17 scull and also silver in the under-21 lightweight single scull events. Sophie's contributions to the club and to the sport were honoured at the 20th anniversary celebration on Saturday with the naming of the new Sophie Malcolm rowing boat. Her sister was granted the honour of breaking the champagne on the boat, while her proud mum and dad looked on. Congratulations to the Centenary Rowing Club for their 20 years of rowing excellence, and particularly to Sophie for her many achievements in the sport. Well done, Centenary Rowing.</span>

This is a great result for the region, made possible through an $8 million investment from the federal government and more than $20 million in contributions from the hub members. The hub will be based at the University of Melbourne's Dookie campus, east of Shepparton, with regional nodes in Birchip, Yarrawonga-Mulwala, Warragul, Inverleigh and Mildura. The hub will operate as a shopfront for farmers to access innovative technologies and practices that will benefit the entire Victorian agricultural sector. As it evolves, the hub is expected to become a flagship precinct for agricultural innovation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next week, a little more than two months since the hubs were announced, the inaugural Future Drought Fund Science to Practice Forum will be held. From 29 June to 1 July the forum will bring together the participants of the eight hubs and provide an important opportunity for members, including farmers, industry, agribusinesses and communities, to connect to and develop these real-world solutions. The forum is an opportunity to contribute to the Drought Resilience Research and Adoption Investment Plan. This will identify gaps and national priorities for the development of new drought-resilient technologies and practices. The forum is a free event, and I urge researchers, farmers and community representatives to get online and register to take part.</span>

With its capacity to deliver funds for small-capital projects and provide real social benefits for local communities, it helps communities to provide for themselves. The problem now is that it's too popular. Under the coalition, this program funds a maximum of only 20 projects, with a total of $150,000 per electorate. The government has not increased the total funding pool over the last five rounds. This round I received 70 applications, worth over a million dollars. A huge number of applications had to be rejected not because the proposals weren't any good but simply because there was not enough funding to cover them. The government's one-size-fits-all approach to funding programs needs to be reassessed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In McEwen we have many small towns and villages, such as Riddells Creek, Romsey and Panton Hill, fast-growing regional centres, such as Gisborne, Kilmore and Whittlesea, as well as the peri-urban fringe. Our needs are diverse and huge. Unlike more urban electorates, we have not one but many fire brigades, sporting clubs, neighbourhood houses, RSLs, men's sheds, service clubs and groups of Scouts and Guides. They're all hardworking and inspiring groups that come up with plans for worthy projects that will benefit their communities now and into the future. But the vision and enthusiasm that this program has inspired within my communities to improve and expand facilities and services in their areas will be replaced by defeat and discouragement. Many have struggled with their capacity to fundraise through the pandemic, and the government has not listened. The coalition government must do more for our local communities—they deserve it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I've always been an enthusiastic supporter of electric vehicles and the immense and vital potential they have to support our emissions reduction targets. Nineteen per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions come from the transport sector. The uptake of EVs will be essential in reducing Australia's emissions to net zero by 2050, which must remain our goal. Electric vehicles provide overwhelming benefits for individuals, the community and our environment. EVs produce no tailpipe emissions and have lower running costs than petrol and diesel vehicles, meaning more money in the pockets of their owners. They provide health benefits through lower air pollution, resulting in cleaner air quality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite these clear benefits, Australia is at risk of falling behind the global EV adoption rate. Electric vehicle sales in Australia account for just three-quarters of a per cent of the overall market, compared to 10 per cent in both the UK and the European Union. It is for precisely this reason that I commend and congratulate the Berejiklian government's Electric Vehicle Strategy, which was announced yesterday. It is the most substantial launch by any state government in Australia. The strategy includes several measures that I have argued for in this parliament. These include stamp duty waivers for EVs and incentives to support commercial fleet purchases. I am particularly pleased that within this strategy there is a strong focus on building EV charging station infrastructure, which remains critical to the adoption of EVs statewide and nationwide. The strategy is a positive move in the right direction, which will help ensure that we can look forward to a net zero emissions transport sector.</span>

The grants matter because they help community groups do more to help each other, to help the people who are part of the group. Since May 2019 our community has received about 117 local grants, supporting community groups, schools, volunteers and sporting clubs. It has been an absolute pleasure to work with each of those groups and schools in order to deliver those grants. I will mention a couple of grant recipients.</span>

The museum was created in 2011 by a small group of volunteers dedicated to preserving and promoting Marion's distinctive cultural heritage. Marion was one of the first townships of Adelaide and is one of only three Adelaide districts designed by Colonel William Light, who was Adelaide's first surveyor-general and picked the site for the city of Adelaide. The museum is located behind the Uniting Church, formerly the Methodist Church established in 1862, on Township Road. The site was originally in the heart of the township of Marion and surrounded by farmland, orchards and grapevines. Of course, before that it was the land of the Kaurna people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The museum and volunteers teach many locals, visitors and school students about the rich history of our local area. It is a community run museum. The collection has come from our local community. People have donated photographs, furniture, clothing, tools, household items and books. I was very impressed with the new exhibition that charts the history of policing in the area. Volunteers also host wonderful walking tours of the area, explaining the rich local farming history, buildings, characters of the district and, of course, our Kaurna heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give my sincere thanks to the wonderful dedicated volunteers—Chairman Peter Stretton, Secretary Kathy Creer, the tireless David Jarman and all the other volunteers—for the amazing work that they do explaining and preserving our local history.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  Yesterday I had the great pleasure of joining the congregation of Mary Immaculate Parish in Quakers Hill to commemorate two very important milestones in Filipino history. The first was celebrating 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines. The Philippines is now the fifth-largest Christian majority country in the world. Pope Francis recognised 16 March 1521 as the day on which Christianity was introduced to the Philippines, the day that Magellan had a mass said. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important milestone being celebrated this year is 75 years of Filipino-Australia diplomatic relations. The Philippines, as a close neighbour, is so important to Australia. It's also so important to Blacktown city. In fact, the statistic that is often quoted is that 75 per cent of all Filipinos in Australia live in Blacktown city. It has become a very popular place for people of Filipino heritage to settle. They're so welcome and they contribute so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all the organisers and the priests involved, including Father Reggie and Father Oliver. Thank you so much for your hospitality, your lunch, your cultural program and your fellowship. Unfortunately, we couldn't do it last year, but it was great to be back this year. Mabuhay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I've said it before and I'll say it again: action on climate change is not just an environmental imperative; it's an economic inevitability. The City of Glen Eira in my electorate is helping lead the way locally by advocating for clean, green environmentally sustainable projects and being proactive leaders in this space. I convened a meeting today with the CEO, Rebecca McKenzie; the Mayor, Councillor Margaret Esakoff; and the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, to advocate for new electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the municipality, funded through the Future Fuels Strategy. The EV charging stations will be installed in high-visibility locations to encourage locals to purchase electric vehicles and create a cleaner environment for all. I am particularly excited to support the advocacy of developing charging facilities at the new Murrumbeena Community Hub, currently under construction thanks to $4 million of funding by this government. This new multipurpose facility represents a prime opportunity to install EV charging stations for future community use. In addition, the possibility of two further EV charging stations at the proposed Carnegie Swim Centre was also flagged, another exciting project that would be in an ideal location. I thank the council for the continued advocacy of these important projects. I look forward to driving my new electric vehicle to one of these locations in the future to recharge it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I wish to acknowledge the achievements of aged-care reform advocate Elizabeth Barton, who I was honoured to award a 2021 Holt Australia Day Award to this year. Liz retired from nursing on 6 November 2020 after an incredible 54 years of service. She is now dedicated to improving aged-care services in Australia as an aged-care reform advocate. Liz believes—and she is very qualified to be talking about this—that, after 20 inquiries and a royal commission, we need a new aged-care act, along the lines of the Victorian safe patient care act, with proper staffing ratios and a focus on the human rights of older people. Liz states that we must end the neglect in our aged-care system and ensure mandatory reporting of elder abuses. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liz is a dedicated, hardworking member of our community, who is also on the Cranbourne Community Hospital consultative committee. She is working to ensure that we deliver an amazing new hospital for local residents in Cranbourne. Liz has also previously made important contributions to the arguments for the important nurse-to-patient ratio legislation. Liz concentrated her submission on palliative care, the area in which she worked tirelessly for 18 years. Her experience and knowledge of the discipline only strengthened the profession's submission and made compelling arguments for the importance of qualified clinicians in end-of-life care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community needs more like Liz Barton, a hardworking community advocate that doesn't mind standing up for what she believes in in the aged-care sector. Thank you, Liz, for many dedicated years of quality clinical care for patients and families at their most vulnerable time.</span>

I want to acknowledge Allison Garoza, a member who lives in North Sydney but spoke of her passion for the brigade; Sacha Price, who made a fantastic cake in the shape of a driptorch to mark the occasion; and Phil, who lives in the only house in the entire brigade region. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1934, John Tipper leased 240 hectares to protect flora, fauna and Indigenous sites and to prevent the loss of Hawkesbury sandstone. In 1969 the neighbouring Sir Edward Hallstrom former reserve and John Tipper's reserve were amalgamated to become the Muogamarra National Park. The Muogamarra Fire Brigade serves that national park. Founded by John Tipper in 1951 and amalgamated with Hallstrom's brigade in 1976, the brigade has been in its present premises since 1991. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2020 fire season, they served all over the state, travelling over 14,000 kilometres and contributing over 4½ thousand hours on the fireground. During the fires the brigade became well known when Darren Irwin started to do his 'Daily Darren' Facebook posts explaining the fire situation using very badly drawn stick figures. The brigade gained a very big Facebook following. Muogamarra now has 53 members, and their senior members have over 100 years of experience, including Jack Barnett, who himself has served for 60 years. They continually attract new members. I want to acknowledge President Anthea Roche; Captain Gordon Morgan, whose service was acknowledge by appearing on a postage stamp; and Deputy Captain James Leitch for their leadership of the brigade. Happy 70th, Muogamarra. Here's to 70 more.</span>

The club was opened on 1 December 1979 and has operated on the current site for 40 years. The concept and planning took 10 years from beginning to opening, and the idea was formulated because friends who played golf together wanted somewhere for their families to get together also. The original club president and board members were in the audience at the lunch. The club supports the community and has provided over $25 million in grants and scholarships over the last 50 years. The lunch also recognised Catholic school year 12 dux students with a scholarship to assist them at university to realise their goals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as community grants and scholarships, the club supports 13 interclub sporting and lifestyle groups, including netball, rugby league, quilters, and pipes and drums. The pipes and drums gave an impressive and inspiring performance which included the Australian national anthem. The support the board of directors provide to the interclubs with advice, compliance and accounting support is immeasurable. Congratulations to the current board of directors, led by Greg Richardson, for their support and the support they offer to our community, and best wishes for the next 50 years.</span>

These changes will see parts of the suburbs of Karrinyup, Gwelup, Trigg and the entirety of Scarborough added to my electorate. I'm looking forward to getting out and hearing what matters most to the people who live there and to supporting the small businesses, sporting groups, community groups and not-for-profits.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In taking on the suburb of Trigg, not only will Curtin become home to Perth's most consistent and crowded wave; we will also be adding our seventh surf life saving club with the inclusion of Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club. Perhaps Curtin will have the title of the official electorate of Surf Life Saving Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I'm proud to formally recognise today Mr Kevin Lynch, of Soldiers Point, who received a Medal of the Order of Australia for sporting services to the community of Newcastle. Mr Lynch is proudly a life member of five sporting organisations as well as being a long-term member of Lions, a volunteer with Meals on Wheels, a parishioner at the Catholic Church for 16 years, and on the board of the local bowling club. Mr Lynch was also a driving force behind the Knights. When we had a tough time staying in the NRL during the ugly super league war, it took a heavy personal toll. He helped start the petition that ultimately ensured that the Newcastle Knights stayed with the Australian Rugby League. Good on you, Kevin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before his retirement to my community of Paterson, Kevin worked for 26 years as a driving instructor, running his own successful business. He proudly says he taught more than 3,000 learners to drive. Anyone who has taught one learner to drive can tell you what a nerve-racking experience that can be. Good on you, Kevin. I think you deserve the OAM for that and maybe even a knighthood, mate!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most heartwarming thing about Mr Lynch is that he has dedicated this award to his wife, and soulmate, Monica. He said she has always been his strongest supporter. I'm so privileged to represent people like Kevin and Monica. Good on you, Kevin, and well done.</span>

Over the last 10 years Lynleigh has spent countless hours volunteering to support injured and vulnerable wildlife. In recognition of her selfless efforts Lynleigh was recently named the 2021 Pittwater Woman of the Year. Residents of the Northern Beaches know Lynleigh as 'the snake lady' and also for her ability to calmly rescue and relocate any wildlife that has wandered from its home into ours. Lynleigh played a crucial role in the launching of the Sydney Wildlife mobile care unit, which was deployed to the South Coast during the devastating Black Summer bushfires, saving the lives of countless fire affected wild animals—in particular, kangaroos and koalas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lynleigh often speaks at schools and local organisations—though it's more a show than a speech—as well as in the media and at charity events, raising awareness and funds to combat threats faced by our wildlife. Lynleigh Greig is a true wildlife warrior and, even though she originally came from South Africa, we on the Northern Beaches are proud to call her one of our own.</span>

With the sad demise of Holden, our last Australian car manufacturer, and a failure to invest and embrace new technologies, Australia has recently been called the automotive third world. Despite practically every major carmaker in the world planning to convert and converting their fleets to electric vehicles with tight targets in place, in 2020 only 0.7 per cent of new cars sold in Australia were electric.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I was pleased to see the New South Wales Liberal government this week announce a $500 million electric car vehicle strategy, I was also bemused. As Labor leader I took to the 2019 election a policy to increase the number of new electric car sales in Australia with a focus on government fleets and to invest in charging stations on our national highways. The Prime Minister, with his only nodding acquaintance with the truth, said in his inimitable style that I wanted to 'end the weekend' and that I was 'declaring war on the weekend'. For all their spin, though, smarter Liberals have quietly crab walked away from their 'dead weekend' nonsense as they see other conservative governments move forward into the future. Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and shadow minister for innovation, Ed Husic, have underlined Labor's commitment to catching up with the rest of the world. This will be a boon for consumers and a boon for our environment.</span>

I am here today for the demise of another leader of a political party in Michael McCormack. I have great respect for Michael and all that he's done. On every occasion that I had dealings with him as the Leader of the Nationals and as the Deputy Prime Minister of this country, he was a man of the highest integrity with a heart and a care for the people of regional Australia and this nation unparalleled by many members of parliament. It was an honour to work with Michael.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have the greatest respect for those people who knew that sticking with their leader even as he was in demise would cost them their ministerial position or other higher positions in the parliament. I have respect for their dedication to their leader of the day, standing with them in the full knowledge that the ministries that they cherish or the jobs that they cherish go with their decency and their concern to stand with the leader of the day. Having supported the leader of the day a number of times myself and having always supported the leader—once something that I shared with a former member of this parliament named Daryl Melham—there is a place for people of honour and people of substance, like those whom we have seen in the National Party today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I want to record a few words of concern around the government's sneaky change to allow international students to work unlimited hours not only in agriculture and aged care but now in hospitality and tourism. This is an appalling policy decision that they don't want to talk about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current limit of 40 hours per fortnight is already the most generous in the world, and removing this limit so broadly undermines the integrity of the visa system. Education must always be the primary purpose of a student visa, but the government is turning the student visa into a low-paid skilled work visa. They're seriously saying that students can work full time and study full time. In my view this undermines the skilled migration program and the evidence says over the long term the full-time work opportunities and wages for Australians. There are more than two million Australians seeking more hours, but, rather than putting pressure on these industries to improve wages and conditions and attract Australians, the government is ensuring that these industries can keep wages as low as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government that said low wages are a deliberate design feature of the economy. We saw it in the budget: $100 billion of new spending and $1 trillion of debt yet wages are going backwards. We should be proud of our international education sector. It's got a high-quality reputation. Turning the student visa into a work visa is disgraceful. Embarrassingly for the government, the chair of its own migration committee expressed public opposition to this change before it was announced, so it seemed they didn't even consult him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  Today I read of the miraculous story of young Richard Hutchinson, a baby born at just 21 weeks and two days gestation, who celebrated his first birthday this month. Richard's parents were encouraged to consider an abortion prior to his arrival, as their baby was given zero chance of survival, but they had greater faith than the medical practitioners providing advice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This story is relevant to the private member's bill that I was to introduce today to enshrine in law protections for a child born alive as a result of an abortion. The Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021 will seek to ensure that this nation abides by the international conventions that we are signatory to: the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The bill seeks to protect the most vulnerable by ensuring that a child born alive as a result of an abortion is provided with the same medical care as any other child, whether that be life-saving treatment or palliative care. The bill was scheduled, as I said, to be introduced into the House today, but, because of other events, I have delayed the introduction of the bill to a later date, which I expect to be 9 August. It's a bill which seeks to protect our most vulnerable, it's a bill which seeks to save lives, it's a bill which seeks to do what is right and it's a bill that I commend to everyone in this place.</span>

I met with Jackson Brown, George Brown and Sherrie Tripp of the Wreck Bay Volunteer Fire Brigade, an Indigenous-run brigade predominantly made up of people from Yuin country. Wreck Bay volunteers have spent the past two summers fighting fires both at home and around the country, with fires coming within a few kilometres of the community earlier this year. The volunteer fire brigade has 35 volunteers out of a community of only about 150 people, which demonstrates the extraordinary community engagement, connection and pride. They're an integral part of the community, putting on events like the Santa Run and providing pathways for leadership for young people. Brigade member Jackson said: 'Nothing makes us more proud than to be one of the few Indigenous brigades in Australia. It puts us in a position where we can protect our mob, engage with them and teach them about fire safety.'</span>

Students have been preparing artwork about what country means to them, local bush tucker, constellations, Dreaming stories and stories of the beautiful natural environment. The school are looking forward to sharing their work with the community this week, and I wish them every success for the NAIDOC Week celebrations.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But yesterday, the South West Rocks Surf Life Saving Club, my club, held their club presentations and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate a couple of people. The first is Stu Cole, recipient of the Volunteer of the Year award. Stu is the patrol captain and the club board and ski captain, and he completed over 80 patrol hours and also assisted in the water safety for the nippers. He also took part in a five-day search and rescue effort for a missing spear fisherman in South West Rocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge Erin Cook, Club Person of the Year, who gained her IRB driver award and is the first female in many years to gain that award. She also regularly patrols and helps with water safety at carnivals and is an incredible asset and a very good role model to younger people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank Sawtell Surf Life Saving Club, who hosted the North Coast awards of excellence on Saturday night. Congratulations to all the recipients. It was a pleasure to be there and to share the evening with you, and I congratulate everyone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  Last week I was contacted by Rachel from Mount Eliza in my electorate, who tells me that over 10 days she couldn't get through to get an appointment for the Pfizer vaccine and then, when she finally got through to the hotline, she was told she can't have a vaccination at the moment because supplies have run out. This morning, Glen from Seaford emailed me and I spoke to him. He can't get Pfizer and he says to me: why is there nothing available on the Mornington Peninsula? He has bipolar disorder and Barrett's syndrome. He should have been at the front of the queue to be vaccinated, yet now he has to wait for an appointment for at least another month and a half in order to, he hopes, get his first dose of Pfizer. Glen says: 'This is a total disgrace. The government had said that they had plenty of supply of Pfizer to accommodate, so where is it on the Mornington Peninsula? This is pathetic, and I want answers.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want answers. We were told that we were at the front of the queue for vaccines in the world, but it's clear that we aren't even in a queue, let alone at the front of it. We've recently had revelations that Pfizer could have given this country many more vaccines than what, in fact, we got. Dr Swan has told the ABC that he understands that we could have had 40 million doses. It's not good enough.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Australia's COVID-19 response has benefited from our nation's strong public healthcare system, a system of which we can all be proud. This year Goldstein is celebrating over 55 years since the first patient received care at the great 'Sandy' Hospital. Taking the tag line 'So comforting to have so close', local advocates in the 1960s understood the central role Sandringham Hospital would play in guaranteeing the health and happiness of our community, and it continues to deliver. The hospital has been extremely valuable to our community's fight against COVID-19, has hosted a testing clinic for locals to use and recently opened a vaccination centre. We're pleased that 'Sandy' Hospital will benefit from the Morrison government's 2020-25 National Health Reform Agreement. The agreement provides an estimated $131.4 billion in additional funding to public hospitals nationwide over five years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, it is led by a competent executive: Dr Lee Hamley, Janet Weir-Phyland, Paul Butler, Peter Joyce, Chris McLoughlin and Amy Kim. But of course there are incredible local staff such as Judy Reeves, who for many years was the nursing director, and more recently Sharon Hade, who has taken over as the director of nursing operations at 'Sandy' Hospital. We're immensely proud of the work that you do with community members to keep our community safe, healthy and prosperous for the future.</span>

There is the bad mayor, Mayor Humdinger, and there is the good mayor, Mayor Goodway. This week we have mayors from all over Australia here for the Australian Local Government Association conference. I'd like to give a shout-out to some mayors that follow in the footsteps of Mayor Goodway. They are good mayors. They include City of Bassendean Mayor Renee McLennan and Deputy Mayor Kathryn Hamilton; City of Bayswater Mayor Dan Bull, whom I met with the Leader of the Opposition earlier today, and his deputy, Filomena Piffaretti; City of Joondalup Mayor Albert Jacob and Deputy Mayor Russ Fishwick; City of Perth Lord Mayor Basil Zempilas and Deputy Lord Mayor Sandy Anghie; City of Stirling Mayor Mark Irwin and Deputy Mayor Bianca Sandri; City of Swan Mayor Kevin Bailey and Deputy Mayor David Lucas; City of Vincent Mayor Emma Cole and Deputy Mayor Susan Gontaszewski; and City of Wanneroo Mayor Tracey Roberts and Deputy Mayor Frank Cvitan.</span>

There are 563 local governments across Australia. Twenty-four per cent of them are based in the great state of Western Australia, many in the member for Curtin's electorate! We always do more than our fair share in Western Australia and we know that local government are an important part of our democracy. That's why only Labor is committed to giving local government a seat at the national cabinet table.</span>

There is mass population displacement involving millions of people, starvation, a healthcare crisis, gender based violence, massacres, looting, extrajudicial killings, the destruction of heritage sites and places of worship, lack of access to essential services and other crimes against humanity, including the alleged use of chemical weapons. This war is being waged by the Ethiopian, Eritrean and regional Amhara forces and is a humanitarian disaster. The Finnish foreign minister and special envoy to the European Union, Pekka Haavisto, told the European Parliament on 17 June:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  Salisbury is a suburb that sits in the middle of my electorate, a leafy suburb pocketed between four major roads, a quiet suburb that many only drive in and out of if they live there or if people are stocking up on Ballistic beer. Last Saturday, Salisbury State School was pumping. The day started with the sounds of disco music being blasted across the school oval at 8.30 am and things just got louder because Salisbury State School turned 100—actually last year, but delayed due to COVID. This year, they celebrated their 101st anniversary. The school has a vibrant history. The suburb of Salisbury was transformed from farm and forestry industries. During World War II it was full of armament factories; postwar, there were refugee settlements; and, finally, it is surrounded by the bustling suburbs of a growing Brisbane city. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the school has experienced the highest enrolment in 35 years and there are more than 20 languages and cultural backgrounds represented there. A special part of the fete was the planting of the bicentennial tree, a blueberry ash planted with help from the magnificent Rotary Club of Salisbury. It will grow into a dense green canopy with masses of pink flowers and is a worthy replacement for the school's giant fig, lost last year. Congratulations to principal Darren Ball, the P&amp;C convenors and all of the volunteers and local sponsors who made the day possible, especially a big call out to Ballistic Beer, a local brewery and a sponsor that I'm always happy to personally support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  I recently had the pleasure of attending the Cooktown and Cape York Expo with my beautiful wife and daughter, Yolonde and Mackenzie. Cook Shire Council had been planning to stage the event in 2020 to coincide with the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's 1770 voyage to Australia. Unfortunately, it became a victim of the global pandemic. Some important facts: many people wouldn't know the <span style="font-style:italic;">Endeavour</span> and its crew of 86 men actually spent 48 days in Cooktown—the longest of any significant land-based stay during Cook's voyage. During their stay, there were countless positive interactions with the local Indigenous people and, more significantly, the first recorded act of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians occurred. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 10-day event was one of celebration, reconciliation and a major catalyst for regional economic renewal but, more importantly, the event focused on the shared history of over 250 years between the local Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, something that is important to both groups. I strongly urge all Australians to put Cooktown on their bucket list and check out the amazing attractions, including the James Cook Museum, Reconciliation Rocks, the boat centre and the botanic gardens, just to name a few. Finally, I would like to give a big shout-out to Mayor Peter Scott and his team for the work they have done over the past few years to make this the resounding success that it turned out to be over the 10 days of celebrations. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Social and Community Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  It's a great opportunity for me to be able to speak about the finance portfolio in this consideration in detail and reiterate that Australia entered the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been our life for a little time, from a position of economic strength. We brought the budget back into broad balance for the first time since the Howard government. The fiscal position that we reached ahead of the pandemic ensured that we were then able to provide support to Australians in an unprecedented fashion. It is for this reason, amongst many, that the Australian economy has rebounded at its fastest pace on record, outperforming all major advanced economies in 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2021 budget consolidates these gains from last year and has put Australia on course for the unemployment rate to fall below five per cent. As we all know, unemployment has reached just 5.1 per cent in the last few days, lower indeed than the 5.3 per cent recorded at the start of the pandemic in March last year. Our fiscal strategies are based around support for strong and sustainable private sector led growth and job creation, recognising that business conditions offer the pathway to a strong and sustainable fiscal position. The priority of the first phase of the fiscal consolidation is to bolster business conditions, improve confidence and create jobs. The aim of this phase is to ensure, as I've said, strong and sustained private sector led growth to drive the unemployment rate even lower. The second phase of our fiscal strategy is to grow the economy in order to stabilise debt. This commitment to balance-sheet discipline will be managed carefully, I can assure the House, so we retain flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic response to COVID-19 has inevitably come at a significant cost. The deficit will reach $161 billion in 2021, but this is some $52.7 billion lower than we expected just over six months ago at last year's budget, and is assisted by more Australians being in work and, of course, fewer Australians on welfare. It further improves to $106.6 billion in 2021-22 before further improving again to $57 billion of deficit in 2024-25. This budget reflects higher than expected tax receipts and lower than expected unemployment benefits—of course, due to the stronger economy. In 2021-22 the government will continue to make necessary investments to help grow our economy to deliver jobs, guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on and keep Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the responsibilities of the finance portfolio relates to the oversight and governance of government business enterprises. In this respect, over the last seven years the government has made an investment of over $93 billion in government business enterprises to initiate or accelerate the delivery of vital productivity improving national infrastructure. This includes NBN, Inland Rail, Western Sydney airport, submarine and shipbuilding infrastructure in South Australia, Moorebank Intermodal Terminal and, notably, Snowy 2.0. These public investments are unlocking $25 billion of private sector investment, and support, amongst other things, job creation especially in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs will also be created through Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap, which is expected to guide $18 billion of government investment over the next decade, drive at least $70 billion of new investment in low-emissions technologies and support 130,000 jobs by 2030. We're investing an additional $2.7 billion to boost the apprenticeship commencement wage subsidy. In this respect, we're uncapping the number of eligible places and increasing the duration of the 50 per cent wage subsidy to 12 months. This further support to business is expected to generate 171,000 additional new apprenticeship places. Deregulation is also central to the government's JobMaker plan and includes $134.6 million in deregulation measures. These are estimated to deliver business a reduction in compliance costs of $430 million per year. Across a range of measures, such as tax cuts, business investments, apprenticeships, training places and a pipeline of infrastructure, we are ensuring that Australia comes back even bigger and stronger.</span>

And, of course, we can't forget the Safer Communities Fund, in which 91 per cent of the funding went to government-held, Independent or marginal Labor seats. Then there's the sports rorts affair. If I focused on that, it would take the remainder of my time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also in this budget continuing a range of ideological agendas. There is the attack on proxy advisers, which are firms who provide advice to investors. You'd think that those opposite would be in favour of free speech and the freedom of proxy advisers, but in fact they want proxy advisers to provide their advice to firms five days in advance. Asked in Senate estimates where these ideas came from, Treasury assistant secretary Tom Dickson said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we looked at overseas developments and we drew particularly on what was occurring in the UK and the US, as well as in other jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, under the Biden administration the United States have changed their position on proxy advisers. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has told the SEC enforcement team to ignore rules introduced by the Trump administration in 2019 and 2020 that would force US proxy advisers to disclose their recommendations to investors before they are made and to give listed companies their research before their clients receive it. As Dean Paatsch of Ownership Matters has put it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The problem when you're importing Trumpian thought bubbles is when those bubbles burst you're really left with nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a measure which Labor has supported in the budget, relating to junior minerals exploration. This is a measure which looks to increase the incentives for junior minerals investors, and I'd like to reiterate to the House Labor's view on this measure. The former shadow minister for resources Gary Gray told parliament on 24 February 2015, in relation to a bill on this matter that was then before the House, 'The opposition supports this bill,' but he went on to talk about the importance of the work of Geoscience Australia in driving exploration in areas such as the Carrapateena resource, a copper-gold formation near the Woomera Prohibited Area, in 2006. He pointed out that that exploration wasn't done for a tax break; it was done for the prize because of the international commodity price cycle and because of an understanding of geology. Gary Gray reiterated frequently to the House the importance of Geoscience Australia. It was in the light of that that, when the bill last came before the House, Labor amended the bill successfully, requiring the minister to publish an annual impact assessment of the Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive. I look forward to seeing the detail of that impact assessment. Labor also believe that transparency is critical, and we pushed on the government the need to disclose which small exploration companies received the benefit of that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is JobKeeper, the rort that keeps on giving, which has seen some $15 billion to $20 billion of taxpayer money going to firms with rising profits. Public universities were shut out of JobKeeper, yet we've now learned that some $17 million went to Bond University, a private university that managed to increase its profits during the pandemic.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  For me as the representative of Goldstein, it's a pleasure to be able to stand here at the podium and ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Finance being in the Senate. Of course, I do so against the backdrop of a budget that was delivered focused squarely on what we need to do to get Australians in employment. Cast your mind back 12 months and think about where the Australian economy was at the time. We all looked with trepidation at the risks that were being posed from lockdowns and international measures which potentially could have stopped not just international tourists but also international trade and, of course, students. We were worried about the consequences of where we could end up, and the focus of the Morrison government at that time was to put energy and initiative into supporting households and families and, more critically, supporting Australians to stay in work during that time. That was the genesis not just of the JobSeeker supplement but, of course, of JobKeeper. JobKeeper was one of the most radical innovations in Australian public policy, through the use of Single Touch Payroll, to deliver income support to Australians through their employer, to make sure not just that people got the financial support they needed but, as measures declined in association with COVID-19, were able to get back into their jobs quickly rather than having employment relationships severed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's the critical difference between this government and the government of Victoria. The Morrison government has been focusing on what we need to do to keep people in private sector jobs—what we need to do to support people so that they can be independent, contribute to the state of the economy and contribute to the growth of the nation as a whole. In the great state of Victoria, my home state, the primary thing the state government did was give public sector workers pay rises throughout the pandemic. Let's think about that. We had people with businesses who were on their knees. They were desperate for assistance and support through state government measures that forced them to shut down—many in the Goldstein electorate but, of course, throughout the entire state of Victoria—and the response from the state government was basically to tell them to go jump. They gave them virtually no support, no assistance. But what they did was take their tax dollars and give public sector workers, who already had significant job security—and, frankly, significant wages—a top-up to reward them for that. We on this side of the chamber have nothing against public sector workers, but we do acknowledge that they're supported through the tax revenues provided by private sector workers and those who create the wealth of the nation. If you're going to have taxpayers, you can't have those that enjoy the benefits of that payment of tax. That's why our focus is always on what we need to do to harden and build up the strength of our country from the citizen, from the family, from the community and from the enterprise up, not through Canberra and state capitals down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the great fallacy that sits at the heart of the mad ideology of the Australian Labor Party and the opposition and that is the enduring strength of the coalition's approach, particularly under a Liberal government. We understand how to build the strength of the nation to make it sustainable and put us in a position of strength not just on the world stage but to be able to provide support and assistance for Australians. That's the type of country we want and we're very proud to fight for every step of the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of measures introduced in this budget that continue that position—continued support for people to make sure that those who are in a position to be able to employ themselves or provide employment for others can do so. The tourism sector continues to struggle as a consequence of international border closures—and the travel sector and travel agents. There are targeted measures in terms of other sectors that need additional support and assistance. But we are looking at COVID-19 not just as a challenge but as an opportunity: how can we be a global hub of capital, particularly using our geography and our isolation to our advantage? Rather than seeing the tyranny of distance as something that holds us back, it's a massive opportunity to contribute to the ongoing opportunities that are provided from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical question for the minister is to look at these challenges and how we are harnessing them. Minister, for the benefit of the opposition, who are on a constant journey of learning—and hopefully one day they'll get there—why is there a benefit in a privately led jobs recovery to get more Australians into work and to consolidate Australia's position as a powerhouse economy, as though that question does not have a self-evident answer?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the consideration in detail today and ask some questions about this budget—a budget that leads us into deficit to the tune of $340 billion over the forward estimates, with no surplus all the way into the medium term, and with gross debt of $1 trillion by 2022-23 with so very little to show for it, so devoid of vision. Never has Australia seen a budget so devoid of vision—a budget that spends nearly $100 billion but forecasts real wages to go backwards. After eight years of stagnant wage growth under this government, they have no plan for wages. Actually, in their own budget papers, they acknowledge that wages are going to go backwards, that economic growth will be below trend over the forward estimates and that wages growth will continue to be at record lows—$100 billion spent but no vision for something better for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a challenging time, going through a pandemic, and we're not out of it yet. We've got a vaccine rollout that's a complete shambles. We will never get our economy back on its feet until we are properly vaccinated—when Australians have certainty that they can get on with that—and we can look towards reopening our borders. There should be positives that we look to. There should be an opportunity to invest in Australia and build back better—a more inclusive Australia, a more inclusive economy and a more sustainable economy. But we see nothing from this government for renewable energy in the budget. Today we have them tearing themselves apart, yet again, because they can't even commit to net zero by 2050—the rest of the world has, but not Australia. We want to really lag behind the world; we want to really embarrass ourselves on the world stage, as the Prime Minister did this week. He can't even commit to net zero, which we're actually supposed to be committed to through the Paris Agreement in 2015. The best we can get from this government is that 'preferably we'll get there'. My first question: how do we justify that to future generations? What's the point if we destroy the planet that we're living on?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The centrepiece of this budget was around aged care; $17 billion sounds like a big figure, but what is it actually doing to solve the problems of neglect that we've seen in our aged-care system, which is absolutely in crisis? A serious question: how is that money directed towards addressing the fact that people are malnourished, the fact that people have had maggots in wounds and the fact that people are lying in their own excrement because there aren't enough staff to look after them properly? How is this money directed towards those staff and paying them properly? Why hasn't the government committed to nurses in aged care 24/7? What about waiting lists for home care? What does the $17 billion do for that, except to put more money towards the providers, many of whom mean well but many of whom have been flaunting their wealth while those in aged care are really suffering?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is in the budget to address poverty, to address the fact that one in six Australian children are living in poverty right now? How does the increase of $3.57 per day in the JobSeeker payment help the 10 per cent of recipients who are single parents? How does it help them to put food on their table and get their kids to school in decent shoes and clothes? These are my questions to the minister. And what does it do for universities? They've been completely left out of the response to COVID. Public universities, as the member for Fenner said, are not even eligible for JobKeeper. I guess some jobs aren't as important as others, according to this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we so devoid of vision? Why have we got a government that has led us into a huge debt with barely anything to show for it? My last question is: why couldn't you find $67 million for the National Archives? Perhaps keeping the critical records of our nation isn't important! Why has the National Gallery got a leaking roof? What about our national institutions? Where's the money for them?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  We know that the key focus of the Morrison government is job creation, and the Finance portfolio and what it delivers as part of this budget are central to that. So it's a pleasure to be asking a question of the Minister for Finance, represented in this place by the Assistant Treasurer. Unlike those opposite, who often forget this fact, we know it is the private sector that creates the majority of jobs. We are here to institute policies that support the private sector—small and medium businesses in particular—to generate jobs and opportunities and to create wealth in our communities. Obviously, those policy settings are on the right track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more Australians in jobs than before COVID, an extraordinary achievement which is the envy of the world over. Our unemployment rate is down to just 5.1 per cent, and this is good news for all Australians. When it comes to delivering for jobs the Minister for Finance, like the Assistant Treasurer and many others in the Morrison government, has a firm track record of backing Australian businesses to create jobs. The Minister for Finance, in his role as the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment delivered multiple free trade agreements and no doubt was involved in laying the groundwork for the recent FTA with the UK. These are agreements that give priority access to Australian businesses to overseas markets and that boost jobs domestically. I know the Minister for Finance as well as the Assistant Treasurer are acutely aware of the responsibility that we have to continue to put Australian businesses front and centre of the policy decisions that we make and to eliminate barriers to enable them to continue growing and employing our fellow Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia we have a thriving manufacturing industry, exporting goods all over the world. We are innovators, creators and entrepreneurs. The Morrison government is focused on ensuring that we continue to have the skills to do this now and into the future. This year's budget delivers $1.3 billion to the Modern Manufacturing Initiative, which will help us achieve this aim. Our initiative will support business collaboration, enable more businesses to bring new products to the market and integrate our local SMEs into global value chains. We will be co-funding capital investments that help manufacturers scale up, invest in new technologies, create and maintain jobs, reskill their workers and develop new products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads me to a topic that often gets raised by small and medium businesses in my electorate of Ryan, and that is procurement and the ease of doing business with the federal government. This is something that the finance minister has paid particular attention to as part of this budget and more broadly. We need to make sure that, when small and medium businesses engage with Commonwealth agencies, there is a streamlined process that reduces costs and red tape and makes it easy to do business. The often repeated refrain of small and medium businesses in the Ryan electorate, as I'm sure it is around the country, is: 'The government expects us as SMEs to be at the vanguard of making sure that we pay our suppliers on time and that we pay the subbies on time. We would expect the same best practice from the government.' That is indeed what we have set about doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the COVID recovery plan we have updated the Commonwealth procurement rules in the government procurement market. As part of the new rules, there's an exemption that will allow agencies to directly engage SMEs for procurements, valued at up to $200,000, which will reduce tendering costs. These, in the life of the federal government, are the smaller value contracts but are incredibly important to the SMEs, and they can mean a real step change for their business if they can do business with the federal government, particularly if it hasn't meant the cost of a very long and arduous procurement process which often favours the primes. They instead allow small businesses to get their foot in the door on government work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quicker payment times will also be provided for. Having many former small and family business owners in the coalition, we understand how crucial managing cash flow is and how getting paid on time is such a vital part of managing any balance sheet. Taking away barriers and reducing red tape to the costs of tendering will mean more small and medium businesses engage with the Commonwealth government. In this budget, we are committed to further support in this area. We will create a series of scans of commercial interactions between Australian manufacturers and government agencies to identify areas in the procurement process that can be improved. That is what good government does: it seeks to continually improve its processes. So my question to the minister is: can you please elaborate on the government's approach to partnerships with the private sector that deliver innovation, support new technology and boost the skills of Australian workers?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  With this budget we're going to have the largest budget deficit and the largest debt—over $1 trillion worth of debt—in the history of our nation. During times of crisis and coming out of a pandemic we understand the need to boost government spending to recharge the economy and to get people back into work, but it's what you spend that additional funding on—and this government's priorities in this budget are all wrong. When you look at the budget papers, particularly over the forward estimates, the government doesn't get much bang for buck through the additional expenditure. Under this government, real wages aren't going to grow over the course of the forward estimates. Economic growth isn't going to charge forward. We're not going to deliver any of the promised improvements to labour productivity. Business investment isn't going to grow. Yet what we're going to see is a continuation of this government's waste and sorry record when it comes to the efficiency of government spending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen what this government is like with taxpayers' funds. First we had sports rorts, where the government completely abused a system that was set up to ensure that public funds went to sporting organisations that needed them the most. The government used it to pork-barrel. The Prime Minister's office was involved with the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate's office in ensuring that the recommendations from Sport Australia were completely ignored, and the government just pork-barrelled funds into marginal seats and coalition held seats. Then that was followed up by the Building Better Regions Fund, $250 million on this occasion, with 89 per cent of the projects and funding between the 2019 election and the end of 2020 going to—guess where?—coalition seats, with 112 out of 330 projects in round 3 and 49 out of 163 projects in round 4 approved by the Deputy Prime Minister's hand-picked ministerial panel, against departmental recommendations. How are you going to start getting the economy on the right trajectory and paying back some of this deficit when you're blatantly wasting taxpayers' money for your own political purposes? It doesn't end there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN, as we all know, has been a complete shambles under this government. Remember that they promised before they were elected in 2013 that the cost of the NBN would be $29.5 billion. Have a guess what the cost is to date. It is $51 billion. They promised that they would be able to roll it out quicker and that the technology would be better, because they weren't going to use fibre to the premises, as Labor was promising to deliver; no, they were going to use fibre to the node and fibre to the curb. Guess what? It wasn't cheaper, they didn't roll it out more quickly, and it takes a lot longer for people to get access to the technology. Now they're talking about actually going back to Labor's original plan of fibre to the premises, but people would have to pay for that, to the tune of about $400 a room. This government is now promising to spend an extra $3.5 billion on rewiring the NBN to deliver Labor's original promise, which it could have done much more cheaply and on time, instead of the wastage of public dollars that we have seen. It doesn't end there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get onto robodebt. The government spent $1.2 billion on a failed scheme that basically embarrassed them and showed just how incompetent they are. They're not my words; they're the words of a Federal Court judge that independently assessed this scheme. He said it was 'a shameful chapter in Australia's history' and 'a massive failure of public administration'. They are the words of an independent judge about this government: 'a massive failure'. That is what this government is—a massive failure. There were $721 million in refunds, $112 million in compo and $398 million in cancelled debts. This government says that it is better at administering public funds. What a joke. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the minister is: what is the government going to put in place to ensure there is integrity in these schemes in the future and that you don't take the opportunity to pork-barrel with Australian taxpayers' funds on all of these schemes that you have announced in the budget?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  This budget has been about the economic recovery from COVID. On that score, we've made a great deal of progress. Unemployment figures out last week, as people here would be aware, showed that the unemployment rate is now down to 5.1 per cent, at a level not seen since before the pandemic. We had 115,000 new jobs created last month, in the month of May. Our economy is larger than it was going into the pandemic. We are one of only eight economies in the world that have maintained a AAA credit rating throughout this. On that score, we have a good record. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this budget is also about ensuring our growth and prosperity in Australia in the medium to longer term, and digital here is really the key to the future. I think, as members here would be aware, the nature of value-creation and the nature of jobs and employment are changing. What we're increasingly seeing is that value-creation is characterised more by electrons than atoms. It's not so much about physical goods as about virtual goods and information and the flows of data. Increasingly, it's spaces rather than places that matter: virtual spaces and virtual marketplaces, rather than physical places and physical offices. Increasingly, it's about services rather than products, whether you're using cloud based storage services, or renting accounting services like Xero or ridesharing services, for instance. This is the way that the economy is changing and this is how the nature of value-creation is changing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, in this sort of a world, Australia actually has a huge number of potential advantages. One of the burdens we've laboured under for most of the modern era is the tyranny of distance—our long distance from marketplaces and the fact that it costs a lot to get physical goods to our customers. Well, in this new era, when what's being created is almost frictionless to move a long distance and across jurisdictions, Australia is well positioned. We are also well positioned because we've got a highly skilled workforce, we've got high-quality tertiary education institutions, we've got companies and institutions that spend a large amount on research and development, and we are a very attractive place to live, to settle, to invest and to locate, and we've only become more so through this pandemic because of how we've performed in health terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is why I think it's incredibly important that this budget allocates a substantial amount of money in new investments and further drives the uptake of the digital economy and digital technology across all sectors of the Australian economy. There's $1.2 billion worth of measures up here. We've got our Artificial Intelligence Action Plan, which provides $124 million to use AI to help modernise manufacturing and farming activities, improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and also enhance our defence capabilities. This AI Action Plan will also fund four centres to bring together industry, peak bodies and technical specialists, to help connect small and medium enterprises to AI tools and research and to provide SMEs with advice and training so they can confidently adopt AI technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also investing over $100 million to support digital skills for Australians, to make sure that Australians are prepared for the workplace of the future, which includes competitive national scholarships to train at least 234 home-grown AI specialists and help address the shortage of specialists which businesses report as being one of the most pressing challenges for them in adopting new technologies. We are also putting almost $120 million into investment incentives for digital technologies that create jobs, including the digital games tax offset, to help make Australia an attractive destination for the rapidly expanding global gaming sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing funding of $40 million to Geoscience Australia to help create a three-dimensional digital atlas of Australia's geography, bringing together a wealth of government data, on people, economy, employment, infrastructure, health, land, the environment and weather patterns into a single national data asset that will help open new economic, social and technological opportunities, from supporting bushfire response and modelling to helping manage feral animals and weeds, virtually designing new roads and helping with major infrastructure projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, digital technologies are also changing how Australians and businesses interact with the government. Australians rightly expect continuous improvement from government, in the same way they do from their other service providers. That's why we're spending almost half a billion dollars in enhancing digital government service delivery, which will allow Australians better access to government services online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, this budget is a transformative one. It contains public investment to accelerate the uptake of the latest technology in both the public and private spheres. I ask the minister representing the finance minister here if he could please comment on the importance of technological modernisation, the uptake of the digital economy and the need for public-private collaboration in taking this forward.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  Labor of course supports using the budget to support the economy in times of need. That's what we did during the global financial crisis, preventing a recession and saving many jobs. It's about how you spend the money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd think you'd get a lot for $100 billion, but this is a budget weighed down with rorts and waste. There are 21 funds either created or topped up in this budget, with some of the government's old favourites for rorts and pork-barrelling, including $250 million more for the Building Better Regions Fund, where we've seen 89 per cent of projects and funding between the 2019 election and the end of 2020 going to coalition seats. One hundred and twelve out of 330 projects in round 3 and 49 out of 163 projects in round 4 were approved by the Deputy Prime Minister's hand-picked ministerial panel, against departmental recommendations. There was a $55 million top-up for the Community Development Grants Program, where 68 per cent of projects approved between the 2019 election and mid-January this year went to coalition seats. There are new ones such as the Preparing Australia Program, which has $600 million to be administered by the new National Recovery and Resilience Agency, ostensibly for a very good cause but at this stage having Minister Littleproud as the final decision-maker. Who is to know whether this fund will suffer the same fate as others?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not to mention the previous examples we have seen. Ninety-one per cent of the $30 million round 3 of the Safer Communities Fund went to government-held, Independent or marginal Labor seats, which involved rejecting the advice of experts and redirecting money to hand-picked projects. There were the infamous sports rorts and the colour-coded spreadsheet, a program in which the ANAO found there was evidence of distribution bias in the awarding of grant funding and that the awarding of funding reflected the approach documented by the minister's office of focusing on marginal electorates held by the coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or Independent members that were to be targeted by the coalition in the 2019 election. Let us not forget the myriad waste examples. Over $6 million was spent on the COVIDSafe app, which didn't work and hasn't been used in the majority of positive COVID cases. There's a question: how many cases have actually been traced by that app? What was the point of that spending? What has it helped with as we deal with COVID? Not much at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten million dollars was spent to create a new logo for spruiking Australian products at an international trade show which was junked. And $2.5 million was spent on planning for a circumnavigation of Australia to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's voyage before it got cancelled. Billions of dollars was spent on contractors, consultants and labour hire. Millions were paid in the form of JobKeeper to companies that made profits or paid out dividends or executive bonuses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that talks about using taxpayers' money carefully. What a disgraceful record they have on wasting that money. And yet their budget shows nothing for wages. They talk about the people that build prosperity and about taking risks and working hard. People who are working hard in this country are not supported. What thanks do hardworking Australians get for getting us through COVID? They get a budget that shows that wages are going to continue to go backwards under this government. There is nothing for wages, nothing for people on low incomes, no vision. It's not often you can spend $100 billion in one go—$200 billion in the course of two budgets—and not really be left with anything. There is nothing to show for it, but that's what this government has done. The government really has no plan other than getting to the next election. It's about doing the bare minimum to make what they see as political problems go away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here on this side of the House we don't see things as political problems. We don't see the aged-care crisis as a political problem. We see it as a genuine human problem that needs a genuine solution—a genuine solution that begins with addressing the fact that so many older Australians are malnourished and the fact that people working in aged care are grossly underpaid and undersupported in that work they're doing. They are central to the outcomes that we see in aged care. The money should be directed towards them, towards getting that right. Everyone can see that that's where part of the problem lies. The fact is we need a change of government to address the real challenges facing Australia.</span>

In essence, a number of the questions asked focused on to what extent we were focused on our private sector led economy and recovery. Clearly, the data we saw on Friday, with an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent, vindicate the decisions taken by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know figures like 5.1 per cent unemployment are not good for the opposition because they vindicate the decisions taken by the government. But that figure shows that backing the private sector—through measures such as instant asset write-off, tax loss carryback, lower tax rates for small businesses, helping them with their workforces with the apprenticeship wage subsidy or helping the residential construction industry with the HomeBuilder program, as we did in last year's pandemic response—has ensured that Australian businesses can keep the foot on the economic accelerator. We have led the world with our economic response to COVID-19. It's vindicated those decisions. The decisions we've taken in the finance portfolio with respect to what has been expansionary budget spending have ensured that not only those jobs are protected but also we have grown the economy. There are more Australians in jobs today than there were in March 2020. The unemployment rate is lower than when we inherited it from the Labor Party. The Labor Party have tried to draw an equivalence between the global financial crisis and the pandemic. The pandemic is 40 times worse economically. There is no equivalence that you can draw between the two. That's why we are right to continue with this strategy. We will continue to support a private sector led recovery of the Australian economy to ensure that we remain at the front of the pack.</span>

This budget will continue to create jobs, guarantee the essential services and build a more resilient and secure Australia. I will address this chamber on a number of important measures that have been led by the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. As the minister responsible for the National Office for Child Safety, I am proud the Morrison government is committed to protecting Australia's children and ensuring their safety and wellbeing in all settings. The budget committed an initial $146 million over four years for the first phase of the National Strategy to Prevent Child Sexual Abuse. The measures lay the foundation for the landmark national strategy, which the Commonwealth is working with the states and territories to finalise for its full release in September 2021. The national strategy will be a 10-year, whole-of-nation framework to establish a coordinated and consistent approach to preventing and responding to child sexual abuse. It was a recommendation of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and will itself implement numerous other recommendations. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national strategy will focus on improving support services for victims and survivors; reducing shame and stigma to support help seeking; holding perpetrators to account and preventing first-time recurrent offending; raising awareness across all layers of society; and building the evidence base, including through data collection and linkage. This package includes $59.9 million worth of initiatives for the Australian Federal Police to combat child sexual abuse, including frontline operations activities; $24 million to strengthen capacity across acute perpetrators of child sexual abuse; $16.8 million for the Attorney-General's Department to enhance legal assistance concerning child sexual abuse; $13.9 million to Home Affairs to better equip intelligence, research and border protection agencies to disrupt the cash flow behind child sexual abuse, disrupt live-stream child sexual abuse, intercept material and offenders at the border, and enhance offender identification; $10.9 million for the National Indigenous Australians Agency to co-design place-based Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander healing approaches to support a victims-survivors. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on last year's budget, the government announced a number of regulatory reforms to ensure that essential safeguards are maintained while making it easier to do business. The government is investing more than $120 million to further support deregulation, which will reduce compliance costs by an average of $430 million annually. This will be achieved by streamlining reporting under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting scheme, benefiting more than 900 companies, reporting on 7,500 facilities every year and saving businesses $11.3 million annually; improving electronic monitoring systems to support approximately 1,220 commercial fishing operators to meet regulatory and data provision requirements; improving the technology neutrality of Treasury portfolio legislation; enabling easier communications between businesses, individuals and regulators; implementing automatic mutual recognition, resulting in savings to 124,000 Australians from having to obtain multiple occupational licences; reducing the reporting requirements for around 1,180 private education providers who deliver courses to international students; providing additional assistance to small businesses with regtech solutions to help them comply with modern awards; and investing in improvements and maintenance for the employment contract tool, which helps small businesses employ their first person.</span>

Through the 2021-22 budget, we are investing almost $1.2 billion in Australia's digital future, through the Digital Economy Strategy. Key initiatives in the budget include over $100 million to support digital skills for Australians, $124 million to build capability in artificial intelligence and $200 million to overhaul myGov and enhance government services. There's a $301.8 million investment in My Health Record; tax incentives to drive business investment, including our new 30 per cent digital games tax offset and changes to the way businesses can claim depreciation for intangible assets like patents and in-house software; and support for small businesses to go digital, including an expansion of digital advisory services and support to encourage businesses' uptake of e-invoicing.</span>

Establishing the agency is one part of our response to the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements. It incorporates the functions of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and the National Drought and North Queensland Flood Response and Recovery Agency. From 1 July 2021, the agency will also include the disaster recovery and risk reduction functions within the Department of Home Affairs and the Rural Financial Counselling Service from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  My question is to the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet—the assistant minister representing a Prime Minister whose incompetence, lack of empathy and obsession with political marketing over policy substance is hurting Australians. Last year the Prime Minister presided over Australia's first recession in nearly 30 years. This was a recession made worse than it had to be by the policy failures of the Morrison government. This year the Prime Minister is repeating the mistakes of the past. He's mismanaging the response to COVID, bungling the vaccine rollout and bungling the need for quarantine facilities. That mismanagement is delaying Australia's economic recovery. It is squandering the opportunity to build back a better Australia after last year's economic and health crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Morrison is failing the Australian people. The first fundamental failure of Prime Minister Morrison is that he refuses to take responsibility. The federal government is responsible for international quarantine—it's there in the Constitution—but Prime Minister Morrison has refused to do his job and implement federal quarantine facilities. Instead, he handballed the hotel system to the states and then blamed everyone else when things went awry. The federal government is responsible for aged-care regulation, but, when COVID-19 hit elderly Australians in nursing homes, Prime Minister Morrison blamed everyone else: he blamed the states; he blamed the aged-care workforce; he even blamed the families. Australians know a blame-shifter when they see one: never doing his job, never taking responsibility, never holding a hose and always finding someone else to blame for his own incompetence and carelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second fundamental failing of this Prime Minister is that's he's all announcement and no follow-up. He makes plenty of big announcements to get the headlines, but, once the media caravan has moved on, he fails to deliver. He junks the promises made to the Australian people and moves on to the next flashy announcement and piece of marketing spin. He is all talk, no action: no follow-through and no delivery. He is a shyster and a con man whose broken promises left Australians worse off. Before the 2019—</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. Before the 2019 federal election, he promised a $4 billion emergency response fund for natural disaster recovery and response initiatives. After the election, not a cent was spent from this fund during 2019-20, a year when thousands of Australians saw their homes and communities destroyed by bushfires. In January 2020, Prime Minister Morrison made another big announcement: a $2 billion National Bushfire Recovery Fund. Eighteen months later, less than one per cent of the bushfire recovery funding announced for primary producer support, telecommunications upgrades and native wildlife rehabilitation has been released by the Morrison government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third failure of this Prime Minister is that he treats taxpayer money like Liberal Party money. Under this government we have seen the systematic misuse of taxpayer funds for the Prime Minister's political benefit: the sports rorts scandal, where the Prime Minister's office used grants that were meant for community sport organisations to bankroll Liberal Party election campaigning; the Leppington Triangle deal, where the Morrison government paid nearly $30 million for land in Western Sydney that was valued at only $3 million; and the rorting of the Safer Communities Fund, where the minister siphoned money that was meant to be used for community safety and directed it to projects designed to bolster support for the Liberal Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such is the government's contempt for taxpayers' funds and their preparedness to use it for their own political games, that the minister the Prime Minister blamed for sports rorts, Senator McKenzie, looks set to be returned to cabinet post the demise of Deputy Prime Minister McCormack. Such is the punishment for someone found misappropriating government funds for political advantage: they spend a year on the sidelines and then they return to cabinet. That's actually a grave punishment compared to what happened to the cabinet minister responsible for rorting the Safer Communities Fund. This is a program where the proceeds of crime money—literally blood money—which are there to protect victims were used to advance marginal seat interests. What happened to Minister Dutton, the minister responsible for it? He got promoted to defence minister. With this cavalier attitude towards taxpayers' funds it is little wonder that the government is budgeting for debt to hit $981 billion in 2025—nearly $1 trillion in national debt with no lasting benefits to show for it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the assistant minister is: does the Prime Minister understand that his refusal to take responsibility, his broken promises and his misuse of taxpayers' funds are all making life harder for Australians struggling with the impacts of the pandemic and the recession?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I'm very happy to participate in this consideration in detail. I want to make particular reference to the Women's Budget Statement. I note that the 2021-22 budget has a landmark $3.4 billion package of new initiatives to improve outcomes for women's safety, economic security and leadership, and health and wellbeing. The government is investing $1.1 billion in funding for women's safety, $1.9 billion in initiatives to support women's workforce participation and economic security, and $351.6 million in health and wellbeing initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been asked a couple of times over the last month why we need a separate Women's Budget Statement. On the issue of safety, the facts are that women are more likely than men to be victims of family, domestic and sexual violence. As we have seen this year, physical and sexual abuse against women is not something that happens somewhere else. It is not limited by demographics, by suburbs or by professions; it can and it does happen anywhere. Anytime or anywhere it happens, it is wrong. According to official statistics and surveys undertaken by the ABS and other bodies over the last five years, on average one woman is killed every nine days in Australia. One in four women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from a current or previous intimate partner since the age of 15. The rate of police recorded sexual assaults against women is almost seven times higher than that for men. Approximately one in two women aged 18 and over have experienced sexual harassment over their lifetime, and nearly 40 per cent have experienced it in the workplace over the last five years. One in six women will experience financial abuse in their lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic, sadly, coincided with an onset or escalation of violence and abuse against women, with two-thirds of women who had experienced it during the pandemic saying it had either started or escalated during this time. These are appalling statistics. There never was, is not now and never will be any justification for any form of violence against women. This should be the only answer needed as to why we need to invest significant money, focus and effort in addressing women's safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of women's economic security, the facts are that, despite women participating in higher education more than men, and having done so for the entirety of this century, women still only hold 18.3 per cent of CEO positions in Australia, only 14 per cent of board chairs and 30 per cent of all board positions. Women are paid less than men, and women, on average, have 22 per cent less in their super balances at retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who believes firmly in equality of opportunity, individual choice and individual responsibility I can happily accept that there will be differences in outcomes between people where those differences arise out of people's own decisions and actions in life and provided that they represent outcomes of real choice and real opportunity, but these statistics are underpinned by evidence that there are still hurdles and barriers that are impacting on women's capacity to make real choices and be equal and full participants. There are still limitations on that goal of real choice and real opportunity, which limits the ability of women to fully realise their potential. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full and open participation of women is a matter of social and economic necessity. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted women through the escalation of violence, abuse and economic insecurity. It also highlighted the importance of women's workforce participation to our economic recovery and prosperity. The Women's Budget Statement has initiatives to combat violence against women, tackle sexual harassment in the workplace, further increase women's participation, narrow the gender pay gap, give families greater choice and flexibility to manage work and care, increase women's financial security and improve women's health and wellbeing. I ask the minister to outline how the initiatives in the 2021-22 budget will deliver practical and real outcomes for women in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic communities right across our nation have turned to the government—the public sector—for essential services, support and expert health guidance. The pandemic has proven once again what Labor has always known: a fair and just society needs a strong and effective public sector. The success of the Australian people at managing this unprecedented health crisis, in which they have put the wellbeing of their fellow citizens first, has been supported every step of the way by public institutions and hardworking public servants across every jurisdiction. However, the COVID pandemic has also brought into stark relief the Liberal-National government's flawed and failed approach to managing our federal public sector and its workforce over the past eight years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regrettable reality is that, since coming to office in 2013, the Liberal-National government, irrespective of who has been the Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister, has been steadfastly engaged in privatisation by stealth of the Commonwealth Public Service. Their record speaks for itself. They cut more than 12,000 federal Public Service jobs before the pandemic hit while simultaneously increasing wasteful spending on expensive consultants, contractors and labour hire firms to do work previously performed more cost effectively by public servants. This is a direct result of the Liberal-National government's ideologically driven approach to the Public Service, which has been exemplified by its commitment to an arbitrary and damaging staffing cap. It is this policy that has made it effectively impossible since 2013 for key service delivery agencies, such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Services Australia, to directly employ the APS workers they have needed to deliver the quality services Australians deserve. Because the cap does not apply to outsourced labour, where agencies have needed more workers they have been forced by the government's myopic policies to engage private labour hire firms, contractors and multinational consulting firms, even though it has been proven time and again that it is demonstrably cheaper and more effective to build up in-house capability within the Public Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You need look no further for the impacts of this policy than the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which last year confirmed that 42 per cent of its workforce, including more than 50 per cent of its claims-processing staff, were being sourced through labour hire companies. This overreliance on labour hire has delayed and disrupted critical services to our veterans, due to staff turnover and the loss of expertise and experience when temporary employees leave. It's also coming at a considerable cost to Australian taxpayers. Evidence at Senate estimates in March showed that the DVA has entered into more than $141 million of labour hire contracts in the six months to 31 December 2020 alone. We know from multiple agencies that the cost of labour hire is frequently well above the cost of ongoing public servants. This isn't just Labor's view; it's also the view of the Prime Minister's hand-picked reviewer of the APS, David Thodey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Independent Review of the APS headed by Mr Thodey delivered its final report in December 2019, explicitly linking declining APS capability to staffing caps and the increasing reliance on contractors and consultants to perform work that had previously been performed internally. The final review said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Labour contractors and consultants are increasingly being used to perform work that has previously been core in-house capability, such as program management. Over the past five years, spending on contractors and consultants has significantly increased while spending on APS employee expenses has remained steady.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That review unequivocally called for the abolition of the staffing cap and a far more critical approach by the government to the use of non-APS labour to deliver public services, especially the associated costs, yet the government remains stubbornly committed to its staffing cap policy that is driving poor outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also failed to take any meaningful action to quantify the cost of its use of private labour in delivering public services, let alone take any action to contain this rapidly escalating cost. That's despite finance minister Simon Birmingham telling the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Daily Telegraph</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the government has accepted, after careful case-by-case assessments, including in some areas of new investment such as aged care and veterans, that it is more efficient and effective to use ongoing staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the minister today is: given the Minister for Finance's omission of Mr Thodey's extensive review along with the evidence from the department and experts, are you persisting with a staffing cap policy that distorts agency decisions and costs Australians more? And, Minister, why does the government continue to be wilfully blind to the growing costs of consultancy for work that was previously done by the Public Service?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I'm delighted to reflect on some key budget initiatives within Prime Minister and Cabinet—the area that we're considering today, following on from the member for Tangney, the assistant minister—and really emphasise that we have absolutely made this budget a landmark budget about women, with $3.4 billion in new measures to improve outcomes for women's safety, economic security, health and wellbeing. That, of course, includes our $1.1 billion in funding for women's safety, the biggest ever investment by a Commonwealth government; $1.9 billion to support women's economic security, including $1.7 billion to improve the affordability of child care for Australian families; and $351 million for women's health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to developing this Women's Budget Statement has been informed by our values of respect, dignity, choice, equality of opportunity and justice, and these are fundamental to the safety and economic security of women in Australia. Through the package of bills on the government's investment for women in Australia, including under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children and the 2018 and 2020 women's economic security statements, everyone has a basic right to safety, equality and respect in our society. We all have a responsibility to address gender imbalances in Australia and create real change and genuine advancements for women and girls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committing more than $400 million across a range of measures to provide additional legal assistance funding for women, to boost investment in children's contact services, to reduce safety risks and to expand family advocacy support services. These measures include $129 million in additional legal funding to women's legal centres to help women access justice. This funding will be directed to women's legal centres to enable these providers to respond to the increasing demand for domestic violence assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An extra $101 million will be put towards children's contact services to reduce safety risks to family law system users, including the establishment of an additional 20 children's contact services. When you look at separated families, desperate to see their children, waiting in queues to have access to their children through children's contact services, I know just how important these 20 new centres will be. Almost $85 million will be invested in the family advocacy and support services to maintain, enhance and expand access to their services. More than $60 million will fund the reform of family law case management in the federal family courts to improve outcomes and better meet the needs of families and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will invest an additional $9 million to further implement the recommendations made in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. The Attorney-General spoke in detail on this. I thank the member for Curtin, who's with me in the Chamber, for her close involvement in getting this response right, which we have done. We now have a Roadmap for Respect. It drives amendments to improve the legal and regulatory responses to workplace sexual harassment and includes interim funding to continue the targeted delivery of support for women experiencing workplace sexual harassment while the government consults with the states and territories. That's our commitment in our Roadmap for Respect. We're also investing $5 million over three years to build evidence and further develop primary prevention initiatives to respond to sexual harassment. We'll also invest $6 million over four years for the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to work with the Respect@Work Council and extend reporting to the Australian public sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's workforce participation is a social and economic priority. It's critical to Australia's recovery from COVID. That's why we've prioritised investment in child care. The budget includes targeted measures to increase choice and flexibility for women addressing barriers to working in the paid workforce and to support women to build financially secure futures. As part of our plan to secure Australia's recovery, we're investing an additional $1.7 billion in child care, building on around $10 billion already provided annually. We are removing the childcare subsidy annual cap and, starting in July 2022, increased childcare subsidies will be available to families with two or more young children, benefiting around 250,000 families by giving them greater choice and flexibility to manage work and care. The childcare measure is so important. As a former minister for child care, I know that families are counting on us and we are delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing money for National Careers Institute partnership grants; we're investing in women in STEM, to really encourage young women to take up science, technology, engineering and maths; and we're focused on improving retirement outcomes for women. This budget demonstrates our continued commitment to creating more opportunities for Australian women.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  My questions are directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Women in the chamber today. I'd like to give a little bit of background to the so-called Women's Budget Statement and where we sit today in terms of addressing the real drivers of gender inequality in Australia. Let us not forget that Australia has fallen from 24th spot to 44th spot in the global gender equality rankings since the government was elected in 2013. That is Australia's worst result on record. We have fallen also from 13th spot to 49th spot on the economic participation and opportunity rankings. We have fallen from 69th spot to 104th spot on health and survival—worse than Turkey, Pakistan and Estonia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has neglected and underfunded the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. The government has failed to respond to or implement the recommendations in a long list of reports that have laid on government ministers' desks without response. First off, let's look at the 2016 COAG report on reducing violence against women and their children. We could look at the 2018 COAG summit statement, the 2019 Law Reform Commission report on family violence or the 2020 National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces. We could look at <span style="font-style:italic;">A husband is not a retirement plan</span>, the report of the Senate inquiry into women's economic security and employment back in 2016. We could go to the report of the inquiry into gender segregation in the workforce and its impact on women's economic equality—another Senate inquiry on causes of the gender pay gap. We could look at a committee that I have sat on since 2013 which has issued a number of reports—and I note that the chair now also shares with me a place on this committee—and that is the Social Policy and Legal Affairs committee. It issued a report on its inquiry into the family law system to better support and protect those affected by family violence. That was a report I handed down to this government at least three years ago from memory. A more recent one, which Deputy Speaker Wallace and I handed down just before Easter, was the report of our inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence. There has only now been a response to the Human Rights Commission's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report because of the extraordinary pressure that has been brought to bear on this government, rightly so, following the horrific allegations of sexual harassment that has taken place in this building and the government's extremely poor management on that front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />If we were under any doubt as to why Australian women voters have concerns about this government, we might also look at the ongoing steadfast refusal to support paid leave for women escaping family and domestic violence. Requests from the sector and women across Australia for 10 days paid leave into the National Employment Standards has been well documented, but there has been nothing from this government—no support whatsoever. Instead they have attempted to make women in crisis drain their superannuation accounts to fund their own escape plans from violent relationships. This year, for the first time ever since the now infamous minister for women Mr Tony Abbott scrapped the gendered budget statement, we've got a Women's Budget Statement in name only. This government has failed to recognise that there is a process called gender-responsive budgeting. It goes to deep structural inequalities, saying that every decision government makes about the way it collects its revenue and distributes its revenue should be run past a gender lens analysis. That is not part of this Women's Budget Statement. Let's not pretend this holds a candle to what we expect women's budget statements to look like in the future. I know we are limited for time, so I ask the minister whether or not she intends to reinstate a truly gendered lens in future years. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="265931" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters and Assistant Minister to the Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to make an opening statement on behalf of the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt. The 2021-22 budget ensures Indigenous Australians are fully part of the Morrison government's plan to secure Australia's economic recovery through delivering the support they need to build skills, address barriers, find employment, nurture thriving families and ensure their communities are safer, healthier and more resilient. In line with our approach under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, we have galvanised every portfolio to play a role in improving the lives of Indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the total appropriations for the portfolio, $1.9 billion relates to Indigenous affairs, with funding provided to the National Indigenous Australians Agency, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. We will deliver a $243.6 million Indigenous Skills and Jobs Advancement package to improve economic, social and education outcomes for Indigenous Australians. This package includes $128.4 million over three years for a new Indigenous Skills and Employment Program, $63.5 million to expand Indigenous girls academies programs across Australia, $36.7 million in increased support for prescribed bodies corporate as well as $15 million in targeted grant programs to improve food security and economic outcomes for remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is committed to closing the gap in employment and economic participation for Indigenous Australians. These new initiatives will invest in skills and training and will contribute to economic recovery and growth for Indigenous Australians following the COVID-19 pandemic. The Morrison government is also providing $111 million for the Community Development Program to meet the increased case load resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as developing a new Remote Jobs Program to replace the CDP from 2023. There is now a great opportunity for Indigenous remote communities to come together to influence and co-design the new Remote Jobs Program in partnership with the government, with pilots to commence later this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Women's Safety Package, the NIAA will receive $26 million over four years to better support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children who have experienced or are experiencing family violence, of which $17 million will expand family violence prevention legal services. These measures build on the Morrison government's continued commitment to the $5.7 billion Indigenous Advancement Strategy, helping to secure Australia's recovery by driving significant progress on a wide range of social and economic outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is proud to support a range of measures across all portfolios in the 2021-22 budget, both mainstream and targeted to provide further investments to deliver support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in achieving their goals. Across the Commonwealth portfolios, Indigenous Australians will benefit from further measures to ensure strong and safe Indigenous families and households, address Indigenous mental health in our communities, protect Indigenous land and promote Indigenous culture. These include $79 million over four years under the mental health package and $117.2 million over four years to establish a national database on service delivery performance and outcomes across the mental health system. Part of the $58.8 million in funding initiatives to attract, upskill and redistribute mental health professionals will also be used to increase the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Women's Economic Security Package, $13.9 million is being directed to support Indigenous women to start social enterprises, improving their safety and economic security. Eleven point six million dollars over four years will expand and create new Indigenous protected areas that will provide greater coverage of sea country to protect marine biodiversity and create additional employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Two point two million dollars will be provided to build the capacity of the Northern Land Council to facilitate land use agreements and drive economic opportunities in the Beetaloo Sub-basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government believes in working together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to make local decisions and in providing the support needed to deliver better life outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Further measures will also be released midyear in line with the delivery of the Commonwealth's first Closing the Gap implementation plan. Thank you for the opportunity to set out some of the highlights of our 2021-22 budget measures, combined with the Morrison government's commitment to transform the way government works with Indigenous Australians. This budget will empower them to get a great start in life, stay safe and healthy, secure employment and contribute to Australia's recovery.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I thank the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet for reading so eloquently such a speech, which I know he didn't write and knows very little about.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">A government member:</span>  That's very rude of you!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SNOWDON:</span>
                    </a>  But it's nevertheless true. I do want to apologise, however, for the member for Barton, who is not able to be here. She is out of Canberra at the moment. I was hoping that the minister would be here to be able to respond personally to the issues that we wish to raise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirteen years ago the Australian government embarked on a great national effort to close the gap and end the disparity between First Nations and non-Indigenous Australians. Thirteen years later—eight of those years having been under the coalition government—five of the seven targets have not been met. The government has now refreshed the targets with 17 new ones, but, extraordinarily, we have seen no new funding for closing the gap in this year's budget. The Prime Minister described closing the gap as the 'ultimate test of our efforts'. He said of closing the gap that his government was 'making that commitment real'. Well, let's see the evidence of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to see real progress on this critical national effort, we need to see it backed by a genuine commitment and adequate funding from this government. So I would ask the minister if he were here: how could it be that funding for the national effort is left out of the nation's pre-eminent financial document, this budget? Minister, you're not here, so you won't tell me, but nevertheless it's a question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that funding for the referendum on constitutional recognition remains in the budget. It was first included in the 2019-20 budget papers. It's been almost two years since the minister addressed the National Press Club to commit to a referendum within this term of parliament. We haven't seen that yet. It's been over four years since the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which outlined the desires of First Nations people for a greater say on the decisions and laws that impact upon them through a constitutionally enshrined voice to the parliament as well as a national process to oversee treaty-making and truth-telling. It has been 5½ years since the appointment of the Referendum Council and almost a decade and a half—14 years—since the former member for Bennelong said in 2007:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I believe we must find room in our national life to formally recognise the special status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as the first peoples of our nation. We must recognise the distinctiveness of Indigenous identity and culture and the right of Indigenous people to preserve that heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will put to the Australian people within 18 months a referendum to formally recognise Indigenous Australians in our Constitution …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was 2007. The government has asked First Nations people for their vision and the government was given it. They responded through the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Australians will be forgiven for thinking this government is cynically dragging its feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question to the government: Minister, when will the government deliver on its commitment to hold the referendum for the recognition of First Nations people in our Constitution and when will the government present a model to Australians on its First Nations voice to parliament or government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate that the Uluru statement contained two further elements—namely, the process of agreement or treaty-making as well as truth-telling through a makarrata commission. Minister, if you're not here, I hope you're listening. Truth-telling is crucial to understanding how the events and trauma of the past are inextricably linked to the challenges of the present. There can be, as you well know, no true reconciliation without truth-telling. With the preoccupation with the discussion around the voice to parliament, we cannot and must not forget these second and third elements of the Uluru statement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the only party to support the Uluru statement in full, and it's committed to realising the statement in its entirety. In February, my colleague Senator Patrick Dodson moved a motion in the Senate for the establishment of a parliamentary inquiry to explore options for a national truth-telling and treaty-making process. The government, sadly, voted it down. What a disgrace. So my final question to the government is: Minister, how will the government act to fulfil the second and third elements of the Uluru statement, the express aspiration for a national process for treaty-making and truth-telling? When will you do it?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I note the contribution from the member for Lingiari and absolutely respect his position on all of these issues and his experience in this area—his knowledge and experience over a long period of time, as he referred to John Howard and his commitment at the head of his government to first moot recognising the Indigenous Australians in our Constitution back in 2007. There is a commitment of both Labor and coalition governments to closing the gap, and over 13 years we've been trying. It's been more trying than we have been able to stand here before you and say, 'Look what we've done.' In fact, I can go back to Kevin Rudd and his disappointment in our performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We respect, as I have respected, the member for Lingiari for his knowledge in this area and his memory of what leaders of our nation have said. I'm sure that, every time they said it, it was heartfelt and deliberate on behalf of their government representing our nation. When you hear the words that John Howard said, Kevin Rudd said and leaders of opposition said in support of what those leaders said, there has been no less desire to respect the Indigenous peoples of Australia, but our respect has not carried through to delivery. If there's no respect—if we cannot respect the rights of Indigenous peoples in this country to be at least recognised in the Australian Constitution, as John Howard outlined and as the member for Lingiari described a few minutes ago—how can we progress? If there is no respect between us and the Indigenous communities we represent, and if there is no respect by them of us because we've never given them a reason to respect us, we can't progress; we can't go forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have openly, along with a number of my colleagues, supported the Uluru statement, in full—no stepping back, but accepting it in full. But this then demands the respect of the Australian people of this parliament to deliver on their behalf. Quite often, my constituents will say to me: 'We elected you to make decisions on our behalf. We don't want to have to stand back here in the electorate and make decisions.' When I go to them and I say, 'What do you think about this issue or that issue?' they say, 'You're actually elected to make the hard decisions.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But sometimes, I don't roll with the mob, whatever the mob are doing, because, when you've got the experience of the member for Lingiari, and perhaps my experience in this place as well, you do have regard for the passage of time, and the healing time that it takes to deal with a lot of issues. You've got to come to a position of absolute respect for the Indigenous communities the length and breadth of the nation, and to look at the nation as a nation—as I did in the parliament today, talking about Christians who are oppressed across the world—and say, 'Well, what are we doing here, in our own land, if we've got this schism between our communities?' That respect goes back 60,000 years. You've got to look at our nation as a nation 60,000 years old, not 250 years old, and to recognise and respect them as an absolutely integral part of our thinking. When we come to that space and we come to that place of respect, we may have an opportunity to move forward.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I acknowledge the contribution just made by the member for Monash, and I acknowledge its sincerity and the member's sincerity, as well as the contribution made by the member for Lingiari on this consideration in detail. One of the ideas that the previous speaker, the member for Monash, just raised was around time: the time that it takes to get progress on these issues and the time that it takes to not just close the gap but heed the call of the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time is important, because we have made Australia's Indigenous people wait too long. In this country, making them wait and introducing delays in answering and heeding the call of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is as critical as saying no in the first place. I think we all would agree that the time it took for this country to have its first Indigenous Australian serving as the minister for Aboriginal affairs was too long, but we all welcomed it and we all welcomed the fact that the minister was that person who was able to perform his duties in that portfolio. But, within days and hours of that minister giving his speech at the Press Club in July 2019, his efforts and his vision for the Uluru Statement from the Heart were undermined by the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has not given its full backing to this minister to realise his vision in this policy area. As the previous member, the member for Monash, and the member for Lingiari correctly stated, it was in the Press Club that the minister said that he wanted to bring a referendum to the Australian people. That is the only way that we are going to change the Constitution, the very document that defines who we are as a country and our history. This government knows that the only way that is possible is if it has the full backing of the government and the full backing of the opposition, with everyone working together in order to make it a possibility. That is why timing is so important. That is why not putting the full resources of the government behind this cause in answering the Uluru Statement from the Heart is as good as saying no. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the most pressing questions that we have for the government are: Why is this thing taking so long? Why does it take so long to put the resources and the effort of the government behind a cause that we should all be united on? Why is it taking the government so long to say yes and to commit themselves fully to the three parts of the Uluru Statement from the Heart? The problem is that, if we let this get away, term after term, the Uluru Statement from the Heart will become more and more distant in the past. We, as custodians for the short period that we get to occupy these privileged roles, will look back and say, 'We were part of the problem, we were part of the delays and we weren't part of the government and the opposition and the parliamentarians that got this done at that time.' So the request we have for the government is: please, will you try to speed things up, to speed up the urgency within the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to pay tribute to Senator Bragg, who has written about this. It is difficult to speak up inside your own party room when there isn't the momentum for it. I acknowledge him because he has added his voice to this, and we need more to do the same. We need more to have urgency and we need more to ensure that time doesn't continue to pass without the Uluru Statement from the Heart being answered in full.</span>

I understand the comments the member for Macnamara has made. I wasn't in the chamber for the member for Lingiari's comments, but I have no doubt, given his long time in his electorate and his close relationship to his local Indigenous people, that it was probably much along the lines of what the member for Macnamara had to say. I acknowledge the member for Lingiari and his work over many years. I know he will be sadly missed, heading into his retirement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to focus more practically, in the short time I have to speak on the appropriation bill, on the Indigenous Affairs portfolio and some of the stuff that we're doing locally in my community of Forde. The Indigenous population represents about three to four per cent of my electorate. There are some key Indigenous organisations in my electorate that I have quite a bit to do with. Whether it is the Yugambeh Museum in Beenleigh, the Beenleigh Housing and Development Company or the various elders groups, all these groups do a tremendous amount across my electorate not only to improve the wellbeing and the outcomes for the local Indigenous community but also, importantly, to work to build a bridge between our local Indigenous community and the broader community. There are people like Peter Eather, the chairperson and president of Beenleigh Housing and Development Company; Will Davis, the CEO of Beenleigh Housing and Development Company; Rory O'Connor, who runs the Yugambeh Museum and is involved in a lot of work in the language space; and the team at Spirits of the Red Sand and the tourism work that they're doing in that space.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look with pride across the work that all of these groups do, at the effort that they put in each and every day for their people, for the Indigenous people who have been part of our country for 60,000 years. They want to ensure that they maintain the language. They want to ensure that they are able to tell the stories of their people not just for the current generations but for the generations to come. It is critically important that those stories continue to be told, as it provides a foundation for the future of their culture.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  On the first constitutionally enshrined First Nations voice, I remember back at Garma, in north-east Arnhem Land, where the member for Lingiari, Senator Pat Dodson, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy and I sat around a table with then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. It was pretty sad because there was a leader who didn't have the fortitude to take this issue and, basically, have the debate and advocate for this very important issue. Eighty per cent of the respondents had said very clearly that a First Nations voice was required. Those opposite obviously got rid of that Prime Minister anyway. Despite slamming the door on what the Uluru Statement from the Heart actually called for, the government has engaged in a consultative process on the design of an Indigenous voice. We're currently in the midst of that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've mentioned, 80 per cent of the over 3,000 submissions—and they are incredibly important—said that the First Nations National Constitutional Convention and the First Nations voices that have contributed to this process have acted in good faith and with the best interests of their own communities at heart. What they said clearly is that a constitutionally enshrined voice is what is required. The government needs to reciprocate the strong voice in those submissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I offer two questions to the minister. Firstly, it's my understanding that up to 80 per cent of the submissions support the enshrinement of the Indigenous voice in the Constitution. If this is not the case, how many submissions from this consultation process support the enshrinement of the Indigenous voice into our Constitution? Secondly, if the figure of supporting submissions is as high as 80 per cent, will the government commit to listening to the people and acting to enshrine the Indigenous voice in our nation's Constitution? I think those questions are very important. Will this process that was entered into in good faith by First Nations people around this country be honoured? We on this side hope that it will and look forward to the minister's response to those two questions.</span>

                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  Earlier this month I had the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and the shadow minister for housing and homelessness, Jason Clare, join me at an event hosted by Bonnie Support Services at Cabramatta in the heart of my electorate. The event was an opportunity to discuss some of the very pressing issues facing my community, particularly the issue of domestic violence and the increasing prevalence of that during the COVID-19 pandemic. The highlighting of the issue of domestic violence has been brought about in light of a range of issues that have demonstrated the urgent need for more crisis accommodation for women and children fleeing violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank Tracy Phillips, the executive officer of Bonnie Support Services, and Ms An Le, the program manager, for their ongoing advocacy and community education in respect of domestic violence. As Tracy Phillips notes, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought an array of challenges for the support services provided by their organisation. She says, 'It's been a very complex 14 months or so since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on Bonnie has been enormous, as no doubt it has been on all services specialising in homeless areas.' Tracy went on to say, 'We saw a doubling in the number of clients from the 2019-20 financial year, and currently our numbers are running extremely high.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These statistics really put in perspective the dire situation faced by organisations like Bonnie Support Services in my community and indeed across the nation. I'm told that Bonnie have not only seen an increase in the number of women and children experiencing domestic violence over the past year but also seen a significant increase in the complexity of these matters during the pandemic. The nature of domestic violence sees women almost isolated before they leave the perpetrator, and in COVID-19 that's only been exacerbated. These feelings are due to the lockdown restrictions and socialised isolation provisions. There have been plenty of examples and case studies from Bonnie's of women who are struggling to buy the essential groceries for their families or put food on the table, with the finances of many of these women impacted by the economic ramifications of the pandemic. In many cases women have lost their employment or have been forced to give up their employment to look after children during these lockdown periods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also advised of the added challenge faced during the pandemic by organisations such as Bonnie's in dealing with clients who are on temporary visas but still nevertheless are experiencing domestic violence. Now, many of these people either have lost their employment or have no work rights and no access to welfare. These women are also very socially isolated and may not have family or friends in the country who can provide housing or support. These women are most vulnerable and in most cases ineligible for any long-term public housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the biggest challenge facing Bonnie's and similar organisations is the severe shortage of affordable and social housing. Local service providers are struggling to keep up with the demand for crisis accommodation and transitional housing as the number of women sleeping rough in our community continues to rise. With the lack of long-term social and affordable housing, many women are facing domestic violence and continue either to be pushed into homelessness or to risk returning to a violent partner. In a country like ours this is just not acceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to affordable, safe and sustainable housing for women experiencing domestic violence is a basic human right, and there is much more that this government can do to address this crisis. That's why I am proud of Labor's commitment, as part of our housing policy, to 4,000 social housing properties to be set aside for women and children fleeing domestic violence. After all, it is what all the experts and those working in the field have been saying is the only viable solution to this crisis. On behalf of a very grateful community I thank Tracy Phillips and her team at Bonnie Support Services. Their commitment to the community makes a difference for the better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise to speak about online safety. Australian children are immersing themselves in the online world rapidly through social media sites, online games, smartphones and tablets. The vast majority of teenagers are using social media. In fact, if you ask a group of 15-year-olds if they're on Facebook, Instagram or one of the other social media providers, almost all their hands go up. Even amongst children as young as eight, a large number report that they use these devices despite most sites having a policy that users must be 13 years of age. Social media is creating a substantial workload for school principals and teachers as well as parents. Creating a specific technology policy guideline in schools has become the norm now. If you ask a group of parents and carers what they are worried about, keeping their children safe online is one of their main concerns. The fear of predators, trolls and cyberbullying preoccupies parents and carers across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fear is real and justified. Last week I met with the inspirational Sonya Ryan. Following the murder of her beautiful daughter, Carly, in 2007 by an online predator, the first crime of its type in Australia, Sonya channelled her grief and set up the Carly Ryan Foundation. Set up in her daughter's honour, the foundation aims to help other children and families navigate the online world safely. Sonya is determined to help prevent harm to other children. As Sonya said herself, 'What defines us as humans is how well we rise from such devastation.' Sonya is not trying to scare young people from social media but make them aware that people online are not necessarily who they say they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good government takes responsibility for protecting its citizens, and that is exactly what the Morrison government is doing. The government will invest $5.2 million in a national online safety awareness campaign. This digital campaign will raise awareness of the new Online Safety Act when it becomes law and the new and strengthened schemes that will be available through the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An important part of the coalition's policy work has been to carefully review the evidence about the pervasiveness and seriousness of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying occurs in a variety of ways through a range of digital devices and mediums, most commonly through smartphones and social media sites. The posting of humiliating or harmful photos, videos or rumours is often exacerbated by other social media features such as comments, shares and likes, which can rapidly promote the spread of the damaging content. Cyberbullying can have very, very serious effects, including anxiety, depression, behavioural problems and even suicidal thoughts. The evidence strongly suggests that the remedy people want more than anything else in this situation is simply to get the harmful material down quickly, but that can be difficult to do. The online safety awareness campaign will promote a world-first adult cyberabuse scheme which will allow Australian adults who experience seriously harmful online abuse to have this material removed from the internet. The campaign will also promote the expanded cyberbullying scheme for children, which will capture a wider range of online services; a strengthened image based abuse scheme to address the non-consensual sharing of intimate images; and an online content scheme that will allow for the removal of the worst of the worst online content, no matter where in the world it is hosted. The campaign will also guide Australians to the resources, support and practical advice available through the eSafety Commissioner about staying safe online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This digital campaign will raise awareness of the new Online Safety Act when it becomes law and the new and strengthened schemes that will be available through the eSafety Commissioner. In addition to this, I note the federal government's Women's Safety Package, including the $21 million investment in women's online safety initiatives in the 2021-22 budget. The funding will allow the eSafety Commissioner to recruit 20 new staff to expand its Cyber Report team and strengthen its capacity to investigate and respond to reports of cyberabuse and other forms of harmful online content. The funding will allow for more rapid responses to reports of online harassment, abuse and harmful online content. It will also deliver an analysis capability for eSafety to identify trends, develop response strategies and provide strategic advice. By raising awareness of the support and services available through the eSafety Commissioner, the federal government will empower Australians to engage more confidently in the digital environment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  The end of our engagement with Afghanistan presents tough questions for Australia, and the world is watching how we honour our commitments. It's going to be really important for the future as we look to an uncertain Indo-Pacific. How we act from here on in—given our 20-year engagement in Afghanistan—is important because the end of our military commitment might be one thing, but we should also accept that the commitments made by our trusted friends demand honourable responses on our behalf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for the Afghan National Security Forces, the ANSF, to protect the sovereignty of their republic. The ANSF forces on the ground today are significantly better trained and more capable than they were 10 years ago, and Australia can take substantial credit for that. But they are a young security force, and the withdrawal of Australian forces should not mark the end of our advisory and capacity-building support. But, given we are closing our embassy in Kabul, it's difficult to escape that conclusion if you're in Kabul.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question we need to ask is: after two decades of war and nation-building, what role should Australia play in the future of Afghanistan? I would like to see the Australian government, in answering this, come clean on what their plans are. Is Afghanistan still important to Australia and its geostrategic interests, as we were told when our intervention began? Or do we just declare that the only reason we were there was as a flag for the US's military intervention, for good reasons, following 9/11?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely we also bear part of the responsibility for the early failure of state building in Afghanistan, as attention and resources were diverted to the Iraq War. The people of Afghanistan are now living with the consequences of those failures, and make no mistake: this disengagement is creating a vacuum in Afghanistan, which is being filled with violence, chaos and great power competition. Without international support we will watch the country further descend into the factionalism that tore the country apart back in the 1990s. This factionalism was then exploited by terrorist groups, using Afghanistan as a base to conduct international action, which, of course, was the whole reason we got involved there in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that IS, al-Qaeda and other extremist groups continue to operate in Afghanistan, and we've seen how, in places such as Syria, the vacuum created by chaos and instability can be quickly filled by these extremist groups. This situation will also mean that there will be more opportunities for powerful actors in the region—China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran—to involve themselves more fully in Afghan affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The deliberate killing of civilians, as we continue to witness, is contrary to humanitarian law and is a heinous crime. The Afghan people deserve the protections afforded to them by international treaties and conventions as inalienable human rights, but these will be increasingly under threat with a resurgent Taliban. These attacks undermine the importance of freedom of speech, human rights and the foundations of a lawful society that Australia says it supports its partner countries in achieving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection of Afghan women fulfilling professional roles in society and the protection of women in general are massive concerns. Afghan women lawyers, judges, educators, journalists, students, political analysts and civil servants are extremely vulnerable. Many have already been displaced from their roles in several provinces or just killed outright.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From talking to senior officials in the Afghan government I know that moral is low and hope is fading. They are feeling abandoned, like many of our faithful interpreters. I want to acknowledge the veteran Jason Scanes who set up an ex-service organisation called Forsaken Fighters. He was here in parliament last week, but I'm not sure whether any government MP had the chance to meet with him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rapid shutdown of our embassy has sent a chilling message about our commitment to that country. Don't get me wrong; it is right that we refocus to the Indo-Pacific, but it's also important that we support those that are trying to survive after 20 years of our commitment. The government has the chance to reverse this disengagement and renew its commitment to peace and nation-building in Afghanistan, and I encourage the government to seize that opportunity.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  This week students at Leonay Public School in my electorate of Lindsay are embarking on their school Canberra trip, and I'll be meeting them here at Parliament House. It's always a delight to see local students here in our nation's parliament getting a hands-on lesson in Australian democracy, and their excitement and engagement truly is heartwarming. When I meet with students both here and in my community, what's always at the front of my mind is: are they being educated and trained with the skills that they need to take on the jobs of the future?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education and Youth recently joined me in Penrith, where I brought together a number of our local principals as well as met with Western Sydney University to discuss the challenges and opportunities for schools and students in our community. I've also recently brought the Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business to meet with my Advancing Manufacturing Taskforce, with representatives from schools, TAFE, universities and our strong local manufacturing industry. Both discussions with schools and with industry emphasise the need to ensure education is preparing these students, equipping them with the right skills for the jobs, that are coming to Western Sydney, but we are not there yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The classrooms of today across Western Sydney are playing the most central role in educating our kids with the jobs of the future. It is absolutely essential we are getting the settings right, from the school curriculum to how our teachers are being trained, to ensure students have the skills they will need to meet the challenges and opportunities ahead. This is an issue I have been passionate about since my first day in parliament and long before. In my maiden speech to parliament I asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How do we move the dial so that more people can work where they live? The answer is in Lindsay. We ensure that Lindsay's world-class education institutions … are training our local kids in the jobs of the future. This starts in school and connects all the way through to post school education and workforce training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that today, in classrooms across Western Sydney, these students are being taught by experienced and qualified teachers with STEM backgrounds. How will local people be prepared, educated and trained in the jobs of the future if their teachers aren't? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity here that we cannot let pass. Western Sydney is poised to create tens of thousands of jobs, developing the emerging industries in advanced manufacturing, defence, space, research and medicine. The investment in the Western Sydney airport and Aerotropolis precinct offers a unique opportunity for us to seize the emerging advanced manufacturing industry. COVID-19 has reaffirmed the importance of a sovereign manufacturing capability onshore, and the private sector recognises the potential of our regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join the Prime Minister in welcoming Visy's $2 billion commitment over 10 years to its Australian operations, made right in the heart of Penrith. The Sydney Science Park, a $5 billion private industry investment, is set to transform Luddenham into a hub for research, education, innovation and commercialisation. They too recognise Western Sydney's potential with the government's investment and desire to accelerate advanced manufacturing. To make the most of this investment in our community we must ensure that our children are developing the skills they will need, and this all comes back to the classroom. We must do more to encourage, recruit and keep STEM professionals in teaching to ensure local people are ready for these local jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education and Youth has launched a review looking at how to attract high-quality teachers and better prepare them to be effective in the classroom. The Quality Initial Teacher Education Review panel's discussion paper notes that quality teaching is the most significant in-school driver of student outcomes and school quality, accounting for up to 30 per cent of the variance in achievement. I'm concerned, particularly focusing on STEM, that there are longstanding shortages of STEM teachers. Data also shows that up to 17 per cent of STEM teachers are not teaching STEM. This is at a year 10 level, when children are being prepared to enter the workforce and further education. Instead, they are teaching non-STEM subjects. The review's focus on attracting and selecting high-quality candidates into teaching and to prepare initial teacher education students to be effective teachers could not be more important in my electorate of Lindsay. I will be working closely with the minister—and we've already had discussions—as the review progresses to ensure that we are leading qualified STEM professionals into classrooms right across Western Sydney to prepare our children, particularly in Lindsay, for the jobs of the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  The arts and entertainment sector was the first to be impacted by the coronavirus restrictions and will be one of the last to return to normal. Very early on in the pandemic Labor called on the government to provide support. However, it took more than 100 days after that call for the government to act at all. For months Scott Morrison and his ministers stubbornly insisted that it wasn't necessary, that somehow an industry that had been completely shut down by coronavirus restrictions didn't need any extra assistance or support. Then, after seven long months, the government finally relented and announced its support package for the arts. But it was full of holes, and it took many more months again for the emergency funding to even start flowing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time to be properly funding and supporting the arts, our artists and, indeed, this industry. There are excellent projects in Newcastle, which this government should be supporting right now, which are ready to be started straightaway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see that the Morrison government has finally realised the value of regional art galleries and has recently funded the Rockhampton Art Gallery for $10 million under the Building Better Regions Fund and the Cairns Art Gallery for $10 million under the Regional Recovery Partnerships program. The City of Newcastle has also applied for $10 million under both of these funding streams. This is a modest request of the Commonwealth by the City of Newcastle for a priority project that is costed at $35.6 million in total. The expansion of the Newcastle Art Gallery has been a shovel-ready project for many years. We just need the Commonwealth to get on board. The Newcastle Art Gallery has tremendous social, cultural and economic value. This expansion project will create an estimated 170 jobs as well as significantly increase visitor numbers to Newcastle and the Hunter region. I've long been an advocate for this project, and I again offer my full support to the Newcastle Art Gallery expansion project. This is a terrific project deserving of this government's full support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another exciting project in my electorate that has also applied for the Building Better Regions Fund is the Victoria Theatre. The Victoria Theatre, opened in 1891, is New South Wales's oldest heritage theatre. The theatre closed in 1966, but, excitingly, the Next Century trust are hoping to reopen the doors of this irreplaceable cultural asset. The construction of the project will generate up to 45 jobs, with a further 165 ongoing hospitality and creative jobs. It's predicted that, within three years of beginning operation, the theatre will deliver $50 million in economic benefit. Newcastle and the Hunter region have been alive with the possibility that the glorious Victoria Theatre may once again enrich the cultural and artistic life of Newcastle and the Hunter. There is a huge amount of community support for this project, and again I strongly urge the Commonwealth government to commit to funding the creative soul of our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government are serious about their belated interest in the arts with the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand Fund, or RISE, then they need to be backing in projects like the Carrington music festival and the Edwards street festival, which have both made applications for that fund. The Edwards street festival, due to take place in March 2022, is a bespoke music and arts curated festival taking place in and around the Edwards bar and restaurant and its adjacent streets. It will play on the precinct's burgeoning and evolving arts and creative scene and will feature live music from Australia's best emerging artists, in addition to well-loved and popular Australian artists. The Carrington music festival will sit within the City of Newcastle's flagship arts festival New Annual in their 2020 program, featuring a mix of international and domestic touring artists. Both of these festivals will be a massive boost to the local economy and will provide much-needed support for Australian musicians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the live music, I'd also like to give a big shout-out to the From A Distance Sessions, or FAD Sessions. These are live-streamed performances from venues in Newcastle that helped keep original music and live performance alive during the pandemic. Led by Allon Silove and Joshua Barnett and run totally by volunteers, From A Distance Sessions helped musicians, dancers, comedians, entertainers and performers maintain a vibrant and current presence during COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many artists and entertainers, recovery is still a long way away. Labor won't forget you, and we'll continue to advocate to get you the support you need and deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  Last week's Queen's Birthday honours list saw a number of wonderful people recognised for their tireless work in our community. In the Hastings Valley, Associate Professor Kevin Alford was awarded an Order of Australia Medal, as were Meg McIntyre and Virginia Hunter Cox. In the Manning Valley, Nancy Boyling was awarded an OAM, as was Chris Dempsey, while George Hoad was named a Member of the Order of Australia. On the Great Lakes, Coomba Park's Felicity Carter received an OAM, and in Vacy Janet Lambert was awarded an OAM. In Bolwarra Heights, Edward Thornburrow also received an OAM. I congratulate them all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've known Associate Professor Kevin Alford for over three decades. Kevin Alford's exhortation resulted in me leaving a position that I had been appointed to at the hospital in Southport on the Gold Coast. Instead, I and Charlotte, my wife, and our three-month-old moved to Port Macquarie, all because Kevin Alford was such a persuasive fellow. Kevin has worked 39 years at the Port Macquarie Base Hospital and before that at the Hastings District Hospital, which was the first hospital I was appointed to as a fully fledged gastroenterologist. Kevin was a force of nature. He encouraged many other young specialists to move to Port Macquarie. Both Kevin and I became examiners for the College of Physicians, with the aim of establishing a training program for registrars at the new Port Macquarie Base Hospital. We were also involved in the setting up of the University of New South Wales Rural Clinical School, which went on to be a full medical school, based from year dot to year 6 in Port Macquarie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kevin has many strings to his bow. He has also been involved in serving the Durri Aboriginal medical clinic in Kempsey and as well as being a senior lecturer and then an associate professor at the University of New South Wales. We were both of the same mind that regional medical training would give better medical graduates, registrars and residents training because regular medical things are seen in big country hospitals. It's a perfect training ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to mention Meg McIntyre, who for years has been a wonderful sports physio in Port Macquarie. She has been a huge fundraiser for the Great Victorian Bike Ride. She participated in the Commonwealth Games as the physio for the Australian women's hockey team. She was Deputy Director of Physiotherapy Services for the Sydney Olympics and worked in the polyclinics there. She has been a physio to the Australian cricket team as well as Chief Physiotherapist at Port Macquarie Base Hospital. She has been a great advocate for multiple sclerosis. She has been a huge community educator about that disease and has fought for funds to investigate and research that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nancy Boyling in Wingham has had numerous community roles: Meals on Wheels, the Anglican parish and the Red Umbrella Project, which raises funds for farmers and their families in drought stricken areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Virginia Hunter Cox from Wauchope has done amazing things for children's education and libraries around the local community. She has also been a volunteer in the Wauchope Show Society and a volunteer for the drug and alcohol team. She has been part of the Hastings Camden Haven Schools Teacher Librarian Network and also volunteered at the Kempsey Library.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christopher Dempsey from Manning Point was a stalwart for various cricket clubs in Old Bar and Roselea and also the Manning Junior Cricket Association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Janet Lambert has been so busy down in Vacy in the Red Cross, the Rural Fire Service, Meals on Wheels and the Vacy School of Arts. She had a 50-year long service medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Edward Thornburrow from Bolwarra Heights has done an amazing amount of work to advance the catering career of many people in many institutions. 'Catering' is his middle name. He has taught so many institutions how it should be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I forgot to mention my old friend George Hoad from Killabakh. He is 'Mr Garden' himself. He has been President of the Garden Clubs of Australia and the Killabakh Garden Club, a judge of bonsai and potted plants in the Wingham Show and the Taree Show, a monthly columnist in gardening, owner and host of Winchelsea Gardens in Killabakh and a great friend of Great Dixter gardens in the UK. He has had an amazing gardening career. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  Isaac Reis was just 22 years old when he died in August 2019 after taking seven different medications. They were all prescribed by his usual doctors and all dispensed by his usual pharmacist. None of the consumer warnings for any of the medications prescribed to him warned Isaac of the risk of death. Prescribed medications are one of the leading causes of accidental death in Australia each year. Each death is made even more tragic because it is avoidable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumer medicine information, or CMI, is the leaflet you get when you have a prescribed medication. It is often provided to you by your pharmacist. It should detail the safe and effective use of the prescription medicine. Each CMI must conform to schedule 12 of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, which requires that it contain information on interactions with other medicines as well as alcohol or any adverse side effects. The TGA acknowledged to the Australian Human Rights Commission this year that they have never regulated consumer medicine information in Australia since they began in 1999. Basically that means that there is no Australian government department regulating consumer medicine information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some examples of consumer medicine information. Dexamfetamine is a schedule 8 drug for ADHD. The CMI for dexamfetamine contains no mention of addiction or death, which can occur even when taken as prescribed. Dexamfetamine is used by around 25,000 Western Australians, including 9,000 children. As to endone, which is a kind of opioid, the Department of Health added the black-boxed warning to opioids in 2020; however, they did not include it in any other medication that opioids combine with to cause death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1999, the CMI for valium has remained unchanged, despite 10,000 deaths linked to benzodiazepines. No CMI has ever mentioned any risk of death. Valium is also regulated by the US FDA, and the US medication guide actually does explicitly state a warning of death. But that's not in the Australian CMI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Human Rights Commission complaint about this details how pharmaceutical companies have excluded life-threatening side effects from hundreds of Australian CMIs for over 20 years. Those risks are known to the TGA. They're included in comparable US consumer warnings, as I mentioned as to valium, which are also monitored by the US FDA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Isaac Reis did not die because he overdosed. He didn't die because he failed to follow his doctor's orders; he died because he did. Experts have warned that there are likely to be more deaths like Isaac's until there are improved consumer warnings in CMIs in Australia. I have to thank my friends Aurelio Costarella and Patrick O'Connor for valiantly pursuing this cause and bringing it to my attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-three thousand veterans are taking five or more medications, and four of the most commonly prescribed medications, including the opioids, benzodiazepines and antidepressants that I have just mentioned here, have no warning of death or addiction in their consumer medicine information. In 2020 an independent report was authored by Patrick O'Connor, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Prescribed </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eaths</span>, and it details how medically-acknowledged risks and side effects have not been included in these CMIs. The head of the TGA has rejected two formal requests to have these kinds of side effects added to CMIs. It is a very simple fix that could save thousands of lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I intend to write to the minister for health and seek a meeting with him about this important issue. It is my strong belief that we here must do all that we can to help stop these preventable deaths by ensuring that consumer medicine information in Australia is reviewed and regulated by the TGA to include explicit warnings about death and addiction.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  There is currently a very fierce debate underway on the Sunshine Coast about a mass transit system with multiple options being considered, from light rail to high-speed buses and trackless trams. The consultation process, which is being run by the Sunshine Coast Council, still has a long way to run—in fact, the surveys finish this week. But I suspect this indeed has a long, arduous road ahead of it, and with that will come ongoing divisiveness within the community, which is awfully sad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, amidst all of the noise and that divisiveness, there does lie a solution around which there is unity. That solution involves heavy rail connecting Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. In particular, I'm talking about two heavy-rail projects that unite the three tiers of government on the Sunshine Coast—each of those tier's local representatives—together with the business sector and the community at large. The first of those two rail projects is for a fully duplicated rail line from Beerburrum to Nambour, which would involve a change to stage 2 of the Beerburrum to Nambour project so it would have two tracks—full duplication—from Landsborough all the way up to Nambour. There's unity among local representatives, the business sector and the community at large for that project. The second project around which there is unity is the idea of having fast heavy rail all the way through to the Maroochydore CBD, bringing rail along that coastal strip for the first time, using the CAMCOS corridor. Again, local representatives of all three tiers of government, the business sector and the community at large are on a unity ticket when it comes to having fast heavy rail using the CAMCOS line all the way through to the Maroochydore CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two projects are not unrelated to the mass transit system that is being looked at—indeed, they are interrelated. The mass transit system is an intraregional system within the Sunshine Coast, but whatever eventuates through that exploration will have to connect with these two other projects. The heavy rail connection from Brisbane all the way through to Maroochydore CBD and from Brisbane all the way up the north coastline to Nambour, together with the Bruce Highway, represents the spine of the Sunshine Coast's transport system. Any intraregional system or mass transit system must connect to the spine, so it makes sense that these two projects, around which there is unity, should come first for the region. Indeed, it will help inform the mass transit scheme as we move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two rail projects also have something else in common, which is that rail is ultimately owned and operated by the Queensland state government. The immediate next steps for both projects ultimately require the Queensland state government to come on board with the local community so that we can progress both ideas. For the duplication to Nambour, the state government is being asked to match the $5 million that has been allocated by the Morrison government to assess the feasibility of full duplication. When it comes to fast heavy rail through to the Maroochydore CBD, the state government is being asked to publicly express its willingness to consider the possibility of heavy rail through to Maroochydore and to be the proponent—as the owner and operator of the network—for such a project. I call on them again today to join with our local community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  South Australia's health system is in crisis. Hardly a day passes without a new media story exposing another failure in the state's health system—failures which are causing people unnecessary suffering and in some cases are risking people's lives. These failures are not the fault of the overworked, committed professional medical staff, who are themselves becoming victims of the ongoing health crisis. They do their best to deal with the daily pressures that are the result of poor administration, inadequate funding, cuts to services and the incompetence of the Marshall and Morrison governments, both of which share responsibility for our health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that SA Health's administration has become a revolving door, with three senior executives lost in a matter of weeks. This includes experienced mental health doctor Adjunct Professor John Mendoza, who quit his role at SA Health in disgust, telling a South Australian parliamentary committee that South Australia's emergency department wait times for mental health patients were the worst in the world. Just as appalling is that, after all the exposures of failures in institutional care, a resident with a disability at the government-run Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre was recently rushed to hospital in a state of neglect. I was recently told of a medical specialist who could not find a bed for a patient in either a private or a public hospital. In another case, a patient allegedly died after being discharged from hospital too early, very likely sent home because there was a shortage of hospital beds. It seems that premature release is now becoming a regular occurrence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elective surgery waiting lists have blown out to years, with scheduled procedures regularly being cancelled at the very last moment, devastating people who have been waiting and suffering for months and, sometimes, years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Adelaide Hospital obesity clinic was closed last year, supposedly on a temporary basis, to make provisions for a possible COVID outbreak surge. Appointments were cancelled at short notice, with patients given no explanation as to why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, ambulance ramping and emergency department waiting times under the Marshall government have been going from bad to worse. People are suffering. In one reported case a young girl's appendix burst after she waited for hours at the Women's and Children's Hospital. Concerningly, while ambulances wait in line for hours at a time at hospital emergency departments they are unavailable for other emergency callouts, leaving people at serious risk. On 12 June the Ambulance Employees Association tweeted the following: 'Last night, Friday the 11th, the ambulance service was again stretched well beyond its capacity. An elderly male having a life-threatening medical emergency waited one hour and 38 minutes for an ambulance. He should have received one in 16 minutes. An elderly patient with sepsis should have had an ambulance arrive in 30 minutes. They waited 14 hours. This is the callous inhumane legacy of the Marshall government, aware of the prolonged suffering but unwilling to prevent it.' I can only speculate on the chaos if a major COVID or flu outbreak did occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under coalition governments, the cost of seeing a doctor has never been higher, with the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP being $39. The average out-of-pocket cost to see a specialist is now $88, and private health insurance has increased by 36 per cent. On top of this the Morrison government has introduced a raft of changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule which will take place on 1 July. While it is unclear what the full impact of those changes will be, it is almost certain that some patients will face increased out-of-pocket costs. Not surprisingly, people are increasingly turning to public hospitals, skipping essential health consultations or not buying medicine because they simply can't afford the cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No amount of denial, political spin or distortion of the facts by the Marshall Liberal government in South Australia will mask the cuts, closures and deterioration in South Australia's public health system. Nor will recent funding promises, made as we head into the next election, to fix the problems made worse under their watch fool the South Australian people, who heard similar promises in the 2018 election campaign which the Marshall government then failed to deliver on. Health care is about quality of life and life-threatening situations. Our health system matters to people. In a country as affluent as Australia the deteriorating South Australian health system is inexcusable and unacceptable.</span>

The social atmosphere will be abuzz. There are four major events: the Ag-Grow Field Days, the CQ Inland Port SEAWAY launch, the Emerald Ag College 50-year reunion and the Emerald Rodeo. Ag-Grow Field Days is a three-day event this Thursday, Friday and Saturday. It was established over 30 years ago. We will have over 300 traders and exhibitors on the day, and 15,000 to 20,000 visitors are expected. That's a lot for a country town. This year will see the introduction of the new Ladies Lane, catering for all things lady, things they have to have—hats, boots, jewellery and more. There will be a Queensland working-dog sale and a Queensland superior bull sale on Friday morning. There will be 100 bulls on offer—of all breeds.</span>
