                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw the Senate's attention to the government's response to this return to order. In relation to this motion for a return to order moved by me and agreed to by the Senate on Wednesday, 14 November, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Cormann, has indicated that the government is not able to respond to the request for documents concerning Gretals Australia, claiming that the return to order was not specific enough, in that the government didn't understand what the word 'application' meant, what 'decision' meant or what the documents were that we were referring to, and that it was unclear what the time frame was. So we have a real Sir Humphrey Appleby response from the government when it's quite clear that, in terms of the context of the matter that's before the Senate, the member for Dunkley, Mr Chris Crewther, is a shareholder of a company with fewer than 25 shareholders which received a $50,000 grant from the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On previous returns to order, I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate to provide all the documents relating to the matter, and this particular matter was admitted from that original return to order, so a subsequent return to order had to be dealt with. It was in the context that I had asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology about this $50,000 grant, and it was indicated that the reason the government was not willing to refer to that is that the application for this money had been withdrawn. The application in question was the application for moneys under the Global Connections Fund, which was an initiative of the Australian government under the National Innovation and Science Agenda, which is funded by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, which is the basis of the question actually asked of the minister and was, in fact, referred to by the member for Dunkley himself in the House of Representatives on 23 October 2017, when, of course, he revealed that the moneys had been received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, subsequently, the minister at the time, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, also referred to this grant in a press release. In fact, if I recall rightly, the grant under the Global Connections Fund had been referred to on two occasions. It was referred to in a list published by the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering on their website, with associated paperwork identifying the grant, identifying the program and identifying the department of industry as the source of that money. And, of course, it was referred to in a copy downloaded on 2 November of this year. However, when we returned to that website on 13 November this year, that reference had been removed. It struck me as passing strange that this had occurred, and I'm wondering why this concealment occurred. It is apparent on all of these various public references that a $50,000 grant had been received by Gretals, a company with less than 25 shareholders of which the member for Dunkley had been a shareholder. This raised questions about section 44—that is, the constitutional prohibition on someone becoming an MP or senator if they have a pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Given the clear statements by the government, by the minister himself on a number of occasions, by the department, by the body that was actually undertaking this work for the department, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, and by the member himself, I want to know why all of those references do not appear to constitute a confirmation that the moneys have been received. And why was the website changed sometime between 2 November and 13 November? That's why I think the Senate is entitled to these documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Cormann, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, has chosen to call me a bush lawyer for asking questions about the member for Dunkley's eligibility to sit as an MP. Minister Cormann doesn't deny the facts in this matter, but he does try to evade the obvious questions that arise about whether this grant has been issued and at what point this grant was issued. And then he sought to talk about another grant—an ARC grant, which was made to the University of Melbourne. They are, of course, entirely different matters under different programs. The grant under the Global Connections Fund, which Mr Crewther has received, was referred to specifically by the member himself. The government, of course, says, 'That was just a mistake.' If that was a mistake, it's the same mistake the minister himself made on, I would suggest, two occasions. If the minister made the mistake, so did the department and so did the academy. I find it extraordinary that the government continues to duck and weave on this issue when it's clear there is much more to be explained about this $50,000—when it was received, whether or not an application was rejected, or, more to the point, whether or not it was withdrawn, which is what I think the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science put to this chamber when this matter was presented in question time in the last sitting period. I think we are entitled to answers to these questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's explanation on these matters demonstrates a slipperiness that really can't be explained by this flippant Sir Humphrey Appleby approach to politics—by suggesting that the order does not specify what the application was or provide sufficient detail of the decision that we're referring to or suggest the limit of the provenance of the documents that were being sought under the terms of this return to order. Senator Cormann asks what time frame applies. These are the sorts of devious means by which a government seeks to avoid accountability for what is a perfectly straightforward matter, a matter which has been the subject of quite considerable public interest. The government, of course, is vulnerable in the other place because it's suggested that there is an issue of confidence. The member concerned has himself raised these matters. The government now understands that, with its minority status, it simply can't behave in this way in the House of Representatives, let alone in the Senate. And I think the government is now trying to avoid answering some pretty basic questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the government should respond properly. If necessary, we'll move another return to order, and I trust the government will find that a little easier to comply with, because the answers are very, very clear. The government should provide the documents, which will reveal what actually happened, given the statements that were made by the previous minister, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, by the department, by the academy and by the member himself, all of which suggest that a grant of $50,000 under the Global Connections Fund was, in fact, issued by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science to a Dr Christopher Richards for medical technologies and pharmaceuticals for the purposes of combatting resistance—normal and natural compounds for use in animal health—in China. It was an Australian company working in China.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the circumstance, Minister, and I would've thought you would've been properly briefed on this, rather than being required to come in here and utter the nonsense that you've been asked to and issuing a letter such as you've been required to, when, in fact, the evidence is very, very clear that the government itself is now seeking to hide the facts in this matter.</span>

But it is true, as Senator Carr indicated, that his motion for the order of production of documents in relation to the matters he has raised was very poorly drafted, and a very poorly drafted motion which is not clear about what it is that he is actually seeking on behalf of the Labor Party makes it very difficult to respond. However, in an abundance of helpfulness, and having made assumptions about what it is that Senator Carr was seeking—and I note that Senator Carr failed to read the material part of the letter that I wrote to Senator Ryan, the President of the Senate—I just point out to the Senate that, in relation to both grants that were raised in the public debate, which he references, I have provided very explicit advice to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've pointed to the response to the Senate on 13 November by Minister Canavan which, in relation to the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, has confirmed that no funds were paid from the Global Connections Funds to Gretals. That is not something that Senator Carr chose to quote when referencing the letter I sent to the Senate. The advice by Minister Canavan to the Senate on 13 November was very explicit, and I will repeat it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My letter also points out that the Australian Research Council grant that has been referred to in media reports and on which previous questions had been based—and this was another grant which had been referenced in public reporting when it comes to Gretals—is a grant to the University of Melbourne. I refer the Senate to my letter on 12 November, which was also copied to Senator Carr. That grant was not a grant to any company. Under the relevant grant program, universities do partner with the private sector on research projects, but that is the situation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I also rise to take note of the reasons for the government not fully complying with this order to produce documents. In fact, Senator Carr's motion calling for all documents regarding the application and decision to award government funding to Gretals Australia Pty Ltd could not be clearer. It is not for this place, necessarily, to have to decide specifically, in each and every way, who, in fact, issued this money in order to ask this place a question, because it is the right of this Senate to hold the government to account and to ask them questions. If they have made public statements about giving grants, about giving money, then they should not be hiding who and where that money came from and how. This chamber may not always know the so-called origin of a grant—or any other decision that this government might speak about—but we should not be precluded from asking the questions. So it is, frankly, absurd for the leader of this chamber to come back with weasel words about not specifying what the application refers to, or what decision it refers to, or the documents that are requiring production—because that is exactly why we asked the question. The government is being nothing other than evasive here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are they being evasive? The issues behind this are very clear. The member for Dunkley, Mr Chris Crewther, is a shareholder in a company with fewer than 25 shareholders, and it was announced that this company received a $50,000 grant from the Commonwealth. This is why we're seeking answers to this question. The company, Gretals Australia, is the one referred to in Senator Carr's motion. It is a company that develops pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. Mr Crewther, the member for Dunkley, said that his company had in fact received this money. His admission is in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of the House of Representatives. This is a grave question for him and for the government's majority in the other place, because, as senators know, there is a constitutional prohibition on any senator or MP having a pecuniary interest in an agreement with the public service of the Commonwealth other than as a member of a company with more than 25 shareholders. So is it any wonder that the Leader of the Government in the Senate wants to be blissfully unaware of what the application refers to, or what the decision is, or to even recognise that what Senator Carr has raised in this place is a legitimate question that should and must be answered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clear questions as to whether such a grant would, in fact, cause Mr Crewther to be a member of the other place. The grants were included in the list of recipients published by the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering in August last year, and Senator Carr referred in this place to the list of those grants. But we've seen—somehow, miraculously—that Gretals Australia were no longer included on that list, which is why Senator Carr has asked for these documents to be tabled. What led to this? What is being concealed? Was the grant allocated? Why was it withdrawn and when? Was its withdrawal something to do with Mr Crewther's eligibility? The government says that Mr Crewther was mistaken in saying the $50,000 had been received. Apparently Senator Sinodinos, who was then the industry minister, was also mistaken. How do we know that? Was the money received? Was it given back? Was his department mistaken?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Senator Carr for raising this very important issue this morning. All relevant documents should be tabled before the Senate. The weasel words coming from the Leader of the Government in the Senate in relation to this matter are purely an attempt to paper over the political problem that the government has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understands very well what this matter is in regard to. They understand it very well. But instead they come back with the weasel words, 'Does not specify what the decision refers to', 'It's unclear to which time frame the order applies,' and, 'What application does it refer to?' You have to go away and figure those things out in the public interest. We and Senator Carr have a right to ask these questions, because we may not always know which grant it was or where it was. But, frankly, Senator Carr does well know—he's made that very clear—and the government knows too. These weasel words won't get you through the significant problems in failing to be transparent around the grant made to Gretals Australia, the grant made where money was apparently received—but was mistaken. Was the money received? We don't know, but we have a right to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in November this year Senator Cormann alleged that there were bush lawyers asking questions about Mr Crewther's eligibility to sit as an MP. Bush lawyer or not, this place has a right to the answers to these questions. It is a legitimate question if this money was given and received at any point in time—or given and then given back—this remains entirely unclear to this place. The simple fact is that the government has not denied the facts presented by the opposition in pointing out the problems with this grant and the very real challenge it creates to Mr Chris Crewther's constitutional eligibility to be a member of the other place.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann claimed that the grant had not gone to Gretals but to the University of Melbourne; but, as Senator Carr made clear, that is an entirely different grant. It is not the grant from Global Connections Fund that Mr Crewther referred to in his statements to the other place last year. Nothing has been said or done here that resolves his connection to this grant. The question remains very clearly about his eligibility to sit in that place. That is the core issue here.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can obfuscate all it likes with weasel words like, 'We don't even know what grant you're referring to.' It is your obligation to know. You are refusing to acknowledge these issues and to release the documents—and you know very well what they are—that would clarify these issues. You can duck and weave all you want, but it's very clear why Senator Cormann and his colleagues would be so anxious about this issue. I continue to call on the government to supply the documents that have been requested in the order to produce documents.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are things in this life that transcend partisan politics. Even though the matters we debate in this chamber are often of great importance to the lives of Australians, it is rarely the case that what we debate is life or death to most people in an immediate sense. This bill is in the rare category of being of immediate concern to all Australians no matter what their politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all watched with great distress as the reports of drought-affected farmers filtered into our electorate inboxes and onto our televisions. The sight of dying cattle and desperate owners and staff touched all of us deeply. We have also seen fire and flood on a regular basis and endured the consequences of global financial crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These hardships, though tough, often bring out the best in Australians. Within moments of hearing that our compatriots are in need, the spirit of mateship kicks in, leading to private donations, fundraising events and no shortage of offers to help. Australians are generous people, it is heartwarming to see, and long may the spirit of philanthropy reign in this land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these hardships ought not be left solely to ad hoc support. Nor should they remain in the political sphere of a sitting government to decide if, how and when such support should be offered to an industry or a community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australia Fund Bill 2018 calls for the creation of a cross-party joint committee to assist in the support and reconstruction of Australian rural and manufacturing industries in times of crisis. The Australia Fund would have the ability to provide emergency and ongoing drought, flood and bushfire relief. It could loan money to businesses, act as a guarantor for loans, capitalise or waive interest, purchase existing bank loans and assume control of relevant property of the business for a specified time. In this way, the fund would be designed to enable businesses to continue operations to earn revenue, employ workers and pay taxes, rather than being prematurely wound up. This would support communities affected by natural disasters for the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order that the committee may deal with what is needed in Australian communities, it is intended that the committee would undertake hearings in all capital cities and major rural centres and specifically examine the impact on rural Australia of ongoing drought and global market price fluctuations for primary industry produce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's terms of reference would also include reviewing existing bankruptcy and insolvency laws, with the aim of introducing legislation designed to assist companies to trade through difficult times, rather than be closed down. The existing taxation laws relating to bankruptcy would also be reviewed. The possible introduction of the equivalent to the United States chapter 11 provisions would also be investigated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is designed to be as representative as possible, so, as well as having two government and two opposition members from both houses, it would also have two minor party or Independent members from both houses. At the completion of its inquiry the committee would table before parliament a detailed report of its findings and recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said before in this chamber that Australia is truly a blessed country. Not only are our natural resources bountiful and our land fruitful, but our people are generous and kind. In supporting this bill, senators will be able to give relief to those who suffer as a result of events beyond their control above the party political landscape, and direct it to those that all Australians see the need to support for the good of all. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  I thank Senator Burston for bringing on for debate the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australia Fund Bill 2018, and I appreciate what Senator Burston has said today with regard to the intent behind the introduction of the bill—what it does and how he believes it will benefit Australians who are doing it tough. As Senator Burston outlined for all of us here and for those listening, the bill would set up a parliamentary committee to consider the matters relating to relief and support for those manufacturing and regional businesses that would be impacted by natural disasters or global economic events and allow these businesses to continue to operate through these adverse circumstances, whatever they may be. Obviously, there are a great number of events that might fall into the category we're talking about here. Natural disasters come in all shapes and forms and, indeed, sizes these days, and with very little warning as well, and they have many, many flow-on and knock-on consequences for many regional communities across the country. Additionally, when we talk about the economic factors, events like world global financial crises, or even local issues, such as commodity prices et cetera—those things have an impact. I'm not quite sure whether all of those things are covered by this bill, having a look at the functions of the committee and of course the definitions relating to the term 'crisis'. But that's something I'll come to a bit later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Australia Fund that would be set up, should a parliamentary inquiry run its course and recommend that the fund be set up and should a government then give effect to those recommendations, would provide a range of various mechanisms to support businesses, as Senator Burston outlined: loans, interest waivers and financial grants, either through industry bodies or directly to individual businesses, obviously taking into account the specific circumstances of the situation the fund would be dealing with. Indeed, Senator Burston also mentioned that the committee would look at assessing whether bankruptcy and insolvency laws could be or should be relaxed as another means of trying to assist businesses get through these tough times, largely—in fact almost always—not of their own doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important though, I think, to reflect on the fact that the parliament—not this one but the one that preceded the one we are now in—inquired into a very, very similar matter, a similar bill, to assist businesses with the same sorts of issues. I think it was chaired by Dr Andrew Laming and had a number of hearings across a number of cities across the country, including Hobart. I'll turn to some of the evidence that was given to that inquiry, particularly at the Hobart hearing, from a number of industry bodies and the like a little later on. I think it's important to point out that, given this parliament—or at least the preceding parliament—has inquired into a virtually identical issue previously and given that the matter has been discharged, the parliament, with the limited time we have before us between now and whenever an election may occur, should spend its time wisely. Reconsidering the same issue, in effect the same terms of reference, would not be a good use of time. Particularly when it comes to issues of urgency like this, dealing with natural disaster relief—things like drought and other types of natural disaster—I think Australians want the government to just get on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm all for trying to restore the Australian people's faith in politicians, but I don't think having another parliamentary inquiry into an issue of such significance, when one has already been conducted, is a great way of trying to get an outcome on this issue. I think a government, perhaps with the input of other senators and other political parties, is better off dealing directly with the communities affected and understanding directly what they need, not through a parliamentary inquiry but just by getting out of this building, getting out of our Senate and joint committees, and going and talking to people. I think it's a novel approach, but it's one that does seem to yield results, particularly in places like Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous inquiry did go to a number of issues that were cited as mechanisms for support already in place for regional communities and businesses that do suffer and face the consequences of these disasters, both environmental and economic. Of the three hearings that were held throughout the country, in Canberra, Melbourne and, of course, Tasmania, the parliament heard from peak bodies, including the National Farmers' Federation, AUSVEG, the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Tasmanian Seafood Industry Council and also experts in disaster relief and recovery, including the Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce, who had a lot of work to do following the 2013 bushfires in south-east Tasmania. The committee also took evidence from public service officials from a number of government departments and, indeed, a number of individual businesses. The committee received around 18 submissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to that point, during the conduct of that inquiry, about a degree of evidence provided around programs and initiatives already on offer to support Australian communities, individuals and businesses, we have things, as I mentioned already. There are programs to support those suffering the impact of the drought that this country faces. There's the $5 billion Drought Future Fund that's been set up, that will, over the next 10 years, grow to the value of $5 billion, noting that drought relief and dealing with environmental conditions is dynamic and an ever-changing occurrence that is sadly becoming more common. We need to just get on, hit the ground and support people with the these programs, rather than talk about them and rather than reprosecute the issues in a parliamentary inquiry. We need to get out and actually provide the support and the resources necessary. Of course, there's always room for improvement. People who want the best for their communities and who are on the ground, who run programs like this, will always listen to that feedback. I think it's important to take it all into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These programs, like the Drought Future Fund, will provide community services and assistance when it comes to the conduct of research and will also assist with the adoption of various new, emerging and innovative technologies. They provide advice when it comes to the construction or reconstruction of infrastructure, to make sure we are futureproofing the investments we are making now so we don't have the same problems. All too often we see timber bridges that were washed away in regional communities being replaced with timber bridges, and we know, next time we have a one-in-50-years event, it will wash away again. We've got to make sure we're using the best technology possible. While that is a flood related example, programs like the Drought Future Fund will assist farmers, communities and businesses related to this sector to be equipped into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the government, rather than talking about it, gets on with investing in things like the Medical Research Future Fund. It is about putting aside funds to make sure that we can invest in the future to make sure we can support emerging innovative technologies, rather than just talking about it here in this parliament. In terms of supporting industry, the Medical Research Future Fund does exactly that: it supports the manufacturing sector in a number of our communities. We have the $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund, the $238 million Industry Growth Centres Initiative, the $90 billion continuous shipbuilding industry program and the $220 million Regional Jobs and Investment Packages. These programs do deliver tangible outcomes. They are there to support industry, business and these communities that are affected in the way that, as I think Senator Burston rightly points out, is felt particularly in regional communities. They have tangible outcomes that people benefit from. That's why I don't believe it's right for us to initiate another inquiry into a matter we've already inquired into as a parliament, but, rather, get on with the job of actually doing what people want us to do—that is, support those regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier on, I did refer to the Hobart hearing of the previous inquiry, which was held in February of 2015. A number of very credible witnesses appeared at this hearing, including representatives of the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Unions Tasmania, the Tasmanian Seafood Industry Council, the Tasmanian Fire Service, WAFarmers, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association and the Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce. Upon hearing what a number of these witnesses had to say, I thought there were a number of things borne out of this that are important for government to take on board when it comes to considering the design and construction of programs to assist communities, businesses, families and individuals to be resilient in these times of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this Hobart hearing, a number of the members of the other place were present and a number of issues were canvassed, starting with the evidence given by Professor Carter from the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, where it was difficult to sort of pinpoint the definition of what is a natural disaster, particularly when it comes to issues that impact on the aquaculture industry and related industries. In Tasmania in recent years we've had Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome hit our oyster industry, which wreaked havoc for quite some time. It cost jobs. Whether or not that could be classified as a natural disaster is something that Professor Carter questioned in his evidence. This was in response to questions from the member for Denison—soon to be the member for Clark—Mr Wilkie: how would a fund like this support businesses like that, if they happened to fall outside the definition of a natural disaster? Those things needed to be taken into account. Through the course of the conduct of this inquiry, and through the recommendations that have been presented as a result, those are things the government has to listen to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it was acknowledged that we need to make sure that there is funding available for research to increase the resilience of these businesses. Professor Carter, as a research scientist, is very keen to make sure that we do structure these industries—particularly ones like the oyster industry, for example—which provide hundreds of jobs in very regional communities in Tasmania, so that they are geared up as best as they possibly can be, using the best technologies available them into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving now to the advice provided by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the two witnesses who appeared were Mr Michael Bailey and Mrs Susan Parr, who was then the chair of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They were very frank about their views on what was being proposed here. They were concerned about the narrowness of the terms of reference of the inquiry and about what the resulting fund would cover, should one be established. The biggest concern they held—in the evidence that I was able to read from their contribution to that hearing in 2015—was around the unintended consequences of perhaps providing support to businesses who feel less inclined to make wise business decisions, knowing that there is a safety net. I'm not sure I share that view 100 per cent, but it is something the chamber did point out as a matter of concern when looking at how you would structure such a fund. All of these things can't be discounted. We need to make sure that whatever the design is, whatever the government does in terms of supporting communities, actually does do the right thing by the community more broadly, that it ticks those boxes when it comes to the original intent of being able to help those industries sustain themselves through the tough times, and that it keeps those jobs in those regional communities and enables those businesses that people have invested in—that create jobs—to carry on business and not go to the wall, which we have seen before, sadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking a look at the advice of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry particularly, they went to the issue of insurance premiums. If a fund, like the Australia Fund, were to be set up, one of the concerns the TCCI had related to whether a business may decide, for instance, not to take out appropriate insurance, knowing that, being in a regional community, they thought, 'Well, you know what? If things go bad, if we have a flood or a bushfire or something like that, or if there is a major economic event, I might be covered by the fund.' So therefore businesses might see this as a disincentive to taking out appropriate insurance, because they know that, if things do go wrong, they can save themselves the cost on the way through, on the premium, and if things do go wrong they will still be covered. That was a matter drawn out by, as I say, the member for Denison, Mr Wilkie. These unintended consequences could create an uneven playing field for businesses in the community, and that is not what we want to see. I think that would be classified as an unintended consequence, and I'm sure Senator Burston would agree with me as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to the evidence provided by Unions Tasmania, there were concerns there about, again, the breadth of the terms of reference; whether the fund and its intentions had missed the mark; and whether the fund might have been a way of perhaps investing in entities that were looking to shed workers, using natural disasters and economic events as a reason for doing so and using the funds from such a fund to support themselves in mechanising their workforce and doing away with the jobs. Again, that would miss the point of what we're talking about here. The families who require funds to pay their bills, to pay the mortgage and to be able to afford to send their kids to school need jobs. A fund like this could potentially end up with jobs being lost, because it assists a business in basically doing away with employees and replacing them with a mechanised workforce. That would definitely be an unintended consequence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian Seafood Industry Council similarly had a number of concerns around whether this type of fund would apply to sea based or aquaculture industries equally as it does to terrestrial based industries—on-land farms, viticulture and other forms of business. That was a concern for them. That was not clear for them. It remains the case. Going back to the evidence provided by Professor Carter from IMAS, it is difficult to properly say whether something like this would help businesses that operate in our waterways and on the sea as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there was a whole heap of evidence provided there, raising a whole lot of questions which I'm not sure were properly answered at the time but that give a government food for thought when it comes to structuring programs to provide direct relief to regional communities and to businesses that need it and to ensure that we have those jobs that we so desperately need. All members of this place talk regularly about doing what can be done and doing our best to ensure that regional communities have the economic benefits of larger population centres. It is regional communities—Senator Burston is right—that bear the brunt of the effects of these sorts of events, so we need to make sure that we gear ourselves up properly. That's why I point to the Future Drought Fund and other industry related future funds to make sure that communities, industries, families and businesses get the support they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to point out that it's not just the realm of the state government. We've seen it in in many parts of this country. Again, if I turn to Tasmania, in 2013 we had the Dunalley bushfires. We've also had, as I've already referenced here, the POMS outbreak in south-eastern Tasmania which decimated our oyster industry and took with it many, many jobs of young Tasmanians; the 2016 northern Tasmania floods, which we experienced during the double-dissolution election campaign; and, of course, in May of this year the extreme weather events in southern Tasmania, which had a huge impact on businesses, households and a number of industries right across the south of Tasmania. State and local governments have a huge responsibility in that respect. The state government in Tasmania, in those examples, provided huge resources in supporting these communities and initiating programs to make sure that appropriate action was taken to support communities and industries and protect those jobs. So it's not just about the Commonwealth. It's not just about a fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Fundamentally, I don't believe having a parliamentary inquiry into something we've already, in effect, identically inquired into is the way to support Australian communities, Australian industries and Australian jobs. So I'm not a supporter of this bill, I'm afraid to tell Senator Burston, but, as I say, it's important to debate these issues thoroughly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I rise, too, to make a contribution on this morning's private senator's bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australia Fund Bill 2018. The purpose of this bill, as described, is to establish a joint parliamentary committee to investigate establishing an Australia Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say from the outset that Labor has some concerns about the mechanism that's being used today to establish this parliamentary committee. Under normal circumstances, such a committee would be established by motion. That's certainly the normal method for establishing a committee. I was hopeful, in listening to the senator's contributions this morning, to come to some better understanding about why this mechanism was sought, but I note that it was a rather short contribution and I certainly didn't get any clarification about why this was the mechanism. So I just put that on the record: we have concerns about legislating to establish a committee when the mechanism is already well established for this to be done by motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, that being said, there's no doubt that, should such a committee be established, it would look into issues that are of great interest to Labor. According to the explanatory memorandum, the fund, as described by Senator Burston, would be designed to assist in the support and reconstruction of Australian rural and manufacturing industries in a time of crisis. It would assist in situations of natural disaster, such as drought, flood and bushfire, or in cases of a world financial crisis or unfair market intervention or manipulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is envisaged, according to the explanatory memorandum, that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Australia Fund would have the ability, on the basis of an assessment of the industry and/or businesses, to provide emergency and ongoing drought/flood/bushfire relief, loan money to businesses, act as a guarantor for loans, capitalise or waive interest, purchase existing bank loans, and assume control of relevant property of the business for a specified time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through you, Acting Deputy President, that's a rather extraordinary range of capacities that Senator Burston is attempting to enable this fund to undertake, and I have some concern that we have had very little detail about the way in which some of the things that are proposed and documented in the explanatory memorandum would, practically, operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fund, according to the EM, would be designed to enable businesses to continue to operate, in order to earn revenue, employ workers and pay taxes, rather than to be prematurely wound up, and to support communities affected by natural disasters. Well, of course, the Labor Party is always interested in jobs and keeping people in jobs, but, again, I think that—with the issues of companies being wound up and concerns that have been raised over the course of this government's tenure of five years so far—there are many issues around insolvency that are live and are worthy of government's consideration, and certainly have been advised to be pursued, that are currently not being considered at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill articulates a determination to provide funds for industry and/or companies restructuring, and the acquisition of new technologies to make businesses more economically viable and internationally competitive. Again, those are enormous goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of its investigation into the need for the fund, it's intended that the committee would undertake hearings in all capital cities and major rural centres, and, specifically, examine the impact on rural Australia of ongoing drought and world market price fluctuations for primary industry produce. I will make some further comments around this, but, at this point, can I absolutely indicate that—as Labor has been pointing out, day after day, when we've gathered in this place, and in our practical action, where we have the capacity to control the agenda, of getting our committees out and into regional and rural Australia—there is a big problem out there. There is a massive problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note Senator Siewert here in the chamber as well, preparing for the next private senator's bill that's to advance in this place this morning. Senator Siewert and I have been out in regional and remote communities inquiring into mental health services and access to mental health services. The standard that is accepted in the bush—the risk that is there—which is impacting on people and their businesses because they simply are not getting access to basic health services, is of critical concern. It speaks to a government that are completely out of touch with regional and remote Australia. Despite their formal partnership with the National Party, who claim to be the party of the bush, we have seen this government cut services, cut support to small business, cut away at the very fabric of the communities that the National Party's supposed to be standing up for, and the National Party have not been here to defend them. I think that is why we saw some very significant swings to Independents in the Victorian election—because of the government's abrogation of its responsibility to go out into the bush and then come back into this place and represent them. They should stop pretending that they support the bush and stand up and do something about it. I'm not surprised that one of the elements that Senator Burston has embedded in his bill is a trip out to the bush, to basically go and have a look and see what's going on, because the current representatives in the National Party are not standing up for their constituency. That is absolutely the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's terms of reference would also include reviewing existing bankruptcy and insolvency laws with the aim of introducing legislation designed to assist companies to trade through difficult times rather than be closed down. The existing taxation laws relating to bankruptcy would also be reviewed. If there's sufficient time after I've finished my prepared material, I will go to the issue of insolvency and bankruptcy and the recommendations that were made a very long time ago by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which Senator Ketter was a part. We raised significant concerns early in the years of this parliament and made very significant recommendations aimed at looking at what's going on in that space. But the government, just like they resisted the banking royal commission for 600 days, have failed to undertake adequate scrutiny of what's going on in insolvency. Certainly we heard an awful lot around the impaired loans inquiry—and a lot of bank loan concerns that were raised by many from rural areas were from your constituency of Western Australia, Acting Deputy President Sterle. There's a lot of work that the government could have been doing on this the whole time, but over five years we've seen them in disarray and not doing what has to be done for the benefit of small businesses and small regional communities across this country. At the completion of the inquiry, the committee proposes to table before parliament a detailed report into its finding and recommendations. It's indicated, in the EM, that the bill will have no financial impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is deeply concerned about many of the issues that the proposed Australia Fund committee would deal with but none more so than the issue of financial misconduct in the banking sector. The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry is undertaking very important work. Labor called for this royal commission—Labor pushed for this royal commission—for 600 days, and the Liberal-National Party fought tooth and nail to prevent it from happening. As more and more financial scandals began to pile up, it became clear to Labor that this was not a case of just a few bad apples. The excuses from the big banks started wearing very thin, and the apologies started to become quite routine: 'Yes, I'm sorry; I'm sorry'. I don't know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I was taught that when you say you're sorry you are supposed to undertake a change of behaviour and not continue to repeat the old one. What we've seen, revealed during the course of this inquiry, is the absolute disregard for community standards around banking and the banks constantly returning to inappropriate behaviours and unethical action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In April 2016, the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Treasurer took the bold and courageous steps of announcing that Labor would call for a royal commission into the banks and financial services industry. It was clear to us that Australia needs better protections and that banks and financial firms needed to lift their game. Again I want to acknowledge the great work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which Senator Ketter was a very significant and valuable member, and its joint report. The joint report made serious recommendations that it was time for us to call a banking royal commission and described the egregious behaviours that were replete within the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to call that royal commission, though, was not easy, particularly from opposition. You'll recall, Mr Deputy President, that we were pilloried for it, we were derided by the government—including by the current Prime Minister, the member for Cook, who told us that a royal commission would be nothing more than 'a QC complaints desk', 'a populist whinge' and 'a reckless distraction'. Well, I'd say the Australian history book will show that the prime ministership of Mr Morrison is in fact a reckless distraction. This government and the Prime Minister consistently asserted that a royal commission would be a waste of time. They did everything they could to stop it from happening. They voted against a royal commission no fewer than 26 times in the parliament. They set up parliamentary inquiries to try and cut across a royal commission. They tried to show that a royal commission was unnecessary. They tried to convince the Australian people that we didn't need a full-blown royal commission. They thought that, by doing so, they could protect the banks from scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But they were wrong. Labor's determination to stand up for the people who were being ripped off by banks was the driving force that continued to push until we got the call for a royal commission. The evidence that we built with the community and through the work of other parliamentary committees was simply too strong to be overlooked. Victims of financial services and the misconduct that they experienced came forward. They came through week after week. Media stories—and members of parliament standing up for them—told the Australian community about an industry that had lost its ethical and moral compass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government finally saw the writing on the wall, when they finally caved in to the pressure from Labor and agreed to a royal commission at the very end of 2017—mindful that we called for it in April 2016, more than a year earlier—the now Prime Minister, the member for Cook, described the decision as 'regrettable'. The Prime Minister and the government thought it was 'regrettable' that the misconduct of financial firms would finally be exposed to the Australian people. They thought it 'regrettable' that victims had lost their homes, their livelihoods and even family members because of that very misconduct. They thought it 'regrettable' that such people would have the chance to tell their stories. They said it was 'regrettable' that the toxic, unethical culture that has infiltrated the financial services sector might finally be exposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's comments that day betrayed him. They showed him for what he is. They showed the Australian people very clearly which side he and his government will always be on, and that is the side of the big banks. When the government have been hostile to a royal commission from the outset, it's no surprise that they severely curtailed the time for the royal commission to do its work. The royal commission has barely had the opportunity to scratch the surface of the misconduct that's occurred in the financial services industry. Commissioner Hayne and his team have done an admirable job—indeed, an extraordinary job given the circumstances that prevail, the circumstances constructed by this government. Commissioner Hayne was given a mere 14 months to inquire into all of these things—retail banking; home lending; consumer lending, including credit cards and personal loans; small business lending; farm lending; general insurance; life insurance; superannuation; and financial advice. Fourteen months was all this government would allow. After 600 days of resisting a royal commission, and after voting against it 26 times, that's the best they could do. They tried to make it as short as they possibly could. When we look at those facts, the commission has had just two weeks to spend on each of these complex subject areas, some of which touched the lives of millions of Australians and some of which relate to services used by nearly every member of the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission received over 10,000 submissions from members of the public. Ten thousand Australians took the time to let the commission know about their experiences of bank and financial services provider misconduct. But, because of the restrictive time line imposed on the commission by this government, who thought the whole endeavour was 'regrettable', only 27 victims had the chance to tell their story in person—27 out of 10,000 Australians who made written submissions. That is a disgrace. That is an absolute disgrace and a shame on this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've learnt through the hearings of the commission that this misconduct was so widespread that it affected hundreds of thousands of Australians, if not millions of Australians. Labor has called for the royal commission to be extended to allow more victims to have the opportunity to share their stories. The government has stubbornly refused to give the commission more time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for financial services, along with some of my Labor colleagues around the country, have run a series of bank victim round tables to hear from some of the tens of thousands of victims whose voices haven't been heard through the royal commission process. The stories we have heard through these round tables have been harrowing. People around the country are hurting. The consequences of the misconduct identified by the royal commission and indeed—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much, Acting Deputy President. Indeed, if the senator had been in the chamber, he would have heard my discussion of the explanatory memorandum, and financial misconduct was seriously a part of this bill, so not only has he abused a point of order but he was wrong in fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories we have heard through the round tables have been harrowing. People around the country are hurting. The consequences of misconduct identified by the royal commission and indeed the consequences of other misconduct that Commissioner Hayne didn't have the time to consider are still being felt by families in every state and every territory, every city and every town in Australia and indeed in the rural and remote contexts that the senator proposes that this committee should attend to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government never wanted a royal commission. They fought tooth and nail to stop it from happening. They called it 'regrettable', and they tried to get it over and done with as quickly as possible. But Labor will not let this commission wrap up quietly and have its recommendations sitting in a filing cabinet in Treasury gathering dust, which is what I expect that the government will do with this report, as they have done with the parliamentary joint committee's inquiry into life insurance. It is just sitting there, with no response, as if it doesn't affect millions of people. Life insurance is critical. They've got the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through you, Acting Deputy President, to Senator Burston: they are a government that, even when you do the work and you report, still do nothing on it, because they don't think they have to, and they're going to protect their mates at the top end of town—unlike Labor. We will roll up our sleeves. We'll continue to speak with victims, with industry, with consumer groups and with regulators, and we will consider the commission's report in detail when it's released—in what we would say is premature time—in February next year. We will make sure that the abuses and the misconduct that have been exposed through the royal commission and through victim round tables never happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Labor is also deeply concerned about the impact that the drought is having on our farmers. Australian farming communities are being affected by a shocking and protracted drought, and Labor knows that governments have a role to play to assist drought-affected farming families. This is why Labor has always stood ready to support meaningful drought assistance by the government. Sadly, though, the Turnbull-Morrison government has been slow in this area, while it has been pushing a fast pace for the banking sector. This government's done nothing to develop a long-term drought strategy. Unfortunately, one of the first acts of the Abbott-Joyce government, elected in 2013, was to abolish the COAG council that dealt with these matters in a responsible matter. As a result, for five years drought reforms stalled—and our farmers, the environment and the economy are paying the price.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will provide a science based approach to help farmers better adapt to what may be a new normal, and Labor will ask the council of RDCs to lead the development of an agricultural climate response plan to dramatically increase the uptake of drought mitigation, best practice and sustainable farming practice methods. Senator Burston, you've given the opportunity for a discussion of significant issues here in the chamber today, but I do continue to raise concerns about the method in which this is advanced. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                    <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I thank Senator Burston for raising the proposal to set up a parliamentary committee to inquire into the Australia Fund. From listening to the previous speaker, I have no idea of what the Labor approach to this particular bill is. Whilst we had a very interesting discussion on the banking royal commission, it's not germane to the debate before the parliament. It always amazes me how the Senate has standing orders and rules, and senators bring matters forward for debate, but some senators completely ignore the debate before the chamber and talk about matters that are completely irrelevant to the debate. For this reason, I often wonder why the Senate bothers with standing orders that are never followed or enforced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding that, this debate on the proposal to set up an Australia Fund is an important debate and, again, I indicate my appreciation to Senator Burston for raising the matter. I might note in passing, though, that the leader of the party that he now represents brought forward a similar bill in the House of Representatives in 2014, when Mr Palmer was a member of the lower house; he was the member for Fairfax at the time. These matters were fully investigated at that time. Part of the proposal for the Australia Fund is to allow rural manufacturing businesses in Australia to continue operating through times of crisis, such as natural disasters and global financial downturns. The previous speaker spoke a little bit about the drought—not much, but she did raise the drought, and I'm glad she raised it, because I've just driven to Canberra via the drought affected shires of Queensland and New South Wales. Over a period of five days I spoke to most of the councils in Queensland that have been subjected to this horrendous drought. I'm very pleased to say—and I take some credit!—that in most of the northern shires that were impacted by drought it was pouring rain as I arrived. So I do, in the best Joh Bjelke-Petersen style, claim that I actually brought the rain with me! Of course, those areas do need a lot more rain; the drought isn't over. But almost unanimously, the councils that represent those areas were appreciative of the work the government had done to help those in need. They understand that governments can't affect the drought. They understand that governments can't make it rain—although I tried to pretend that I could! But they do acknowledge that in these times of crisis the government, including the Queensland and New South Wales state governments, have been very generous in the support they've given. A number of matters were raised with me as to where improvements could be made, and they're matters I'll be talking about at a later time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would point out that the government is establishing a $5 billion future drought fund that guarantees support against future droughts faced by farmers and communities in rural and regional Australia, and it's important that not only farmers but also regional communities are considered. Too often, in years gone by, drought relief was given to people on the land without considering the impact of droughts on the communities—on the people in those communities who are not farmers but who support the farmers, help the council create infrastructure, help the hospital and health services to continue operation and help in educating the young people of the community. This future drought fund being established by the Liberal-National government will be setting up guaranteed support against future drought faced by farmers and communities. The future drought fund starts with an initial $3.9 billion investment each year, and $100 million in earnings will be available to be used to fund important water infrastructure and drought resilience projects while the balance is ploughed back into the fund so it grows to $5 billion over the next decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise that this fund will help to fund important infrastructure projects. Regrettably our opponents in this chamber, the Labor Party, because they are beholden to the Greens political party for political support in this and various state parliaments, will never become involved in water infrastructure projects. That's a great shame. Our government funds feasibility studies into water infrastructure possibilities, but we always acknowledge that, under the Constitution, rivers and streams, except where they cross state boundaries, are the province and the responsibility of state governments, and so only state governments can decide to build dams. We have the difficult situation in my state of Queensland where the state government, because it's in power due to the support of the Greens political party, who don't like any form of water management schemes, will not agree to any dams. We promised to build the Rookwood Weir near Rockhampton. After great work by the local member there, Michelle Landry, the state government refused to answer anything and refused to comment for a number of months. It was only as the state election was approaching that they finally agreed that a weir could be build—the Rookwood Weir on the Dawson River, funded by the federal government—and reluctantly put in some funds to match the federal government. But that's the only way we can get any action out of a government that relies on the Greens, who oppose dams, for support. We are very conscious that this future drought fund will have an important water infrastructure role, and I think Senator Burston and Mr Palmer would be grateful for that approach, because I think they both understand the importance of water infrastructure as part of drought resilience in the drier parts of Australia. The challenges of a drought vary from farm to farm, district to district and town to town. The government continually needs to adapt and build capacity to support those communities, and the future drought fund will do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal by Senator Burston and his party also relates to research into things that might help in Australia. I remind the Senate that the Morrison government has created the Medical Research Future Fund, another sovereign body which is specifically designed to supercharge the growth of our health and medical research industry while fuelling jobs, economic growth and export potential. In addition to that, the Australia Fund proposed by Senator Burston relates to manufacturing, but the government has already invested in key measures to ensure people working in manufacturing are supported as industry changes. I remind the Senate that the government has established the $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund, the $238 million Industry Growth Centre Initiative and the $90 billion continuous shipbuilding industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just pausing for a moment, for a long time Australia has lamented its ability to have a long-term shipbuilding industry. I remember in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years that the Labor Party did absolutely nothing to support the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Since the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was defeated, we've had a lot of complaints from Labor about things that they never did, but this government, the Liberal-National government, has established a $90 billion continuous shipbuilding industry which won't just build ships but will train Australians in the finest trades relating to all aspects of shipbuilding. I envisage that in years to come we'll be exporting some of our skilled tradesmen to go and help other countries in shipbuilding programs. It's a wonderful program, it's a huge program, and it will give Australia a decent, ongoing and sustainable shipbuilding industry for many years into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing the measures that the government has introduced actually work. The total number of people employed in the manufacturing sector in Australia is now 978,000. In fact, over 93,100 new manufacturing jobs were created in the 12 months to August 2018. So, whilst this bill talks about setting up a committee that will look at an Australia Fund to possibly help manufacturing jobs, the government's actually doing it already. As I say, the work the government's been doing is already having a very, very positive effect. The 25 months of consecutive expansion in the manufacturing area is the longest period since 2005. Unfortunately, Senator Carr's not taking part in this debate. He was the minister for industry in charge of manufacturing when all of the motor car manufacturing in Australia shut down, when shipbuilding ground to a halt and when many other manufacturing jobs were lost. That has changed under this government, which has a serious interest in manufacturing jobs and the skilled workers who actually—</span>

                    </a>  No, you don't understand, Senator. You've only been here for a minute. You wouldn't understand that the premise to the shutdown of the manufacturing industry all occurred when Senator Carr was the minister. Senator Carr did nothing and eventually the car manufacturing industry ground down to a halt. And what did that? It was the fact that Senator Carr, as industry minister, did absolutely nothing to help the motor car building industry, the same as he and his party in government did absolutely nothing to help with a sustainable shipbuilding industry into the future. All they could do was complain about Australia not having a shipbuilding industry. They were in government for six years and did not build one ship—they did not even think about building one ship—and did nothing to support the car manufacturing industry and both of them failed. But, since the Liberal-National Party has been in charge, the number of people directly employed in the manufacturing sector in Australia is now almost a million workers. I repeat: 93,100 new manufacturing jobs have been created in just the last 12 months—something that never occurred when Senator Carr and the Labor Party were in charge. More than one million jobs have been created since the Liberal-National government was elected back in 2013.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                    </a>  I appreciate the thoughts behind Senator Burston's bill, which, again, is a bill to establish a joint parliamentary committee to look at whether an Australia Fund should be created, for all the right reasons. But I've demonstrated in the short time available to me just some of the things that the government's done that are already doing what Senator Burston imagines the Australia Fund bill might do. I also point out to the Senate that, as I mentioned previously, a similar bill was brought before the House of Representatives in 2014. A committee was set up, and it was informed by a public consultation process and inquiries. It held a number of hearings throughout Australia, including in Canberra, Tasmania and Melbourne. It heard witnesses from a range of stakeholders including industry peak bodies and Public Service officials. Furthermore, the committee received 18 submissions from groups from as wide a field as Oysters Australia, the Australian Prawn Farmers Association and rural business development. Based on the evidence, the committee did not believe that the case had been made from public submissions to support a new fund of the type outlined in this bill. Recommendation 9 of that committee's report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee does not recommend the establishment of an Australia Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I won't be supporting this bill and the government won't be supporting this bill, for the reason that it's already been investigated by a parliamentary committee that decided not to recommend the establishment of a fund. As I've pointed out in my speech, the government has already, in different ways, done the sorts of things that the fund would seek to do if it were established following the parliamentary committee. I say to Senator Burston: in fact, you're repeating or borrowing from the ideas already introduced by this government. I might say Mr Palmer is very good at that, and I always take it as a sign of praise that Mr Palmer also has pinched the idea that I have been talking about for some months now, about a review of the current zone tax rebate system. I see on TV advertisements that Mr Palmer has picked up my idea and is now talking about it. I quite like Mr Palmer, but I say with respect to him that his idea of giving everyone 200 kilometres from a capital city a 20 per cent reduction in income tax just doesn't pass the seriousness test. But I'm hopeful, and I keep advocating to the government that the zone rebate scheme—set up, I concede, by a Labor government in 1945—was a good scheme. It ticked all the right boxes then. It needs review and updating, and it needs an indexation of the benefits. I'm hopeful that the government will hear the calls for a review of that existing zone tax rebate scheme and the analogous remote area allowance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But thanks to Senator Burston for raising this important issue. It allows me to point out the things this government is already doing to address the concerns that Senator Burston raised when opening this debate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I rise today to speak to the private member's bill that I put forward in 2016 but which is now absolutely essential. When I first introduced the Great Australian Bight Environment Protection Bill in 2016 the company that wanted to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight was BP. It then moved on to Chevron, and now it is Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, the Norwegian company that wants to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight and put at risk our wonderful, unique and precious marine ecosystem, and our tourism and fishing industries in South Australia. If there were a spill, it would not just have a devastating effect on my home state of South Australia; it would devastate coastlines and beaches right up to Port Macquarie, including Bondi Beach, and as far west as Albany in Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The local communities and the fishing and tourism industries that rely on a healthy and pristine Great Australian Bight are very concerned that this could happen to our precious marine ecosystem. The debate around the risk of drilling in the Great Australian Bight is reaching fever point. The reason that I'm bringing forward this bill for debate today in this place is that Equinor, the latest big foreign company that wants to drill for oil, wants to do so as early as next year. Hot on its heels are a number of other companies. NOPSEMA, the agency responsible for ticking off on these types of operations, might give the tick of approval for seismic testing as early as a fortnight's time, meaning seismic testing would start as early as March next year some 90 kilometre off Kangaroo Island. That is why the debate today on this issue is so important. It's important for South Australia—it's absolutely essential for our tourism and fishing industries—but it's also important for the rest of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me outline a number of the key reasons that make the Great Australian Bight so special. The bight includes the calving sanctuary for the southern right whales. During the months of July through to October we have dozens and dozens of southern right whales calving and feeding their young calves right at the head of the bight. It's a special place. It's such a special place that from the mainland, from standing on the shoreline, you can see dozens of whales and their calves in that pristine and protected area. After the calving season, those whales swim south, right down to the bottom of the Southern Ocean. It is a whale sanctuary for a reason. It is one of the unique places in the world where this activity happens and where these whales swim, raise their babies and look after them ready for the trip south. We know that it is a feeding ground for threatened sea lions, sharks, tuna and migratory sperm whales. In fact, 85 per cent of the species in the bight are found nowhere else in the world. That is how unique the Great Australian Bight is in terms of being a marine sanctuary, a special place for many species that live nowhere else in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why we would put that at risk is beyond me. We need to be protecting these areas, not putting them at further risk of either extinction or damage. The idea of throwing away what we have in terms of having a unique and special place, just because a foreign company wants to come in and drill for oil, is simply madness. It is, of course, part of the most iconic aspects of Australia's coastline. It is part of our identity. In South Australia, Kangaroo Island is resting right there in the Great Australian Bight. Kangaroo Island is the jewel in our tourism crown. For those who haven't visited Kangaroo Island, you're missing out. It is one of the most special places on earth. It is lucky to have gorgeous coastlines, beautiful beaches and a unique tourism industry. You can catch the ferry over to Kangaroo Island and stay for a night or two, or even longer if you like. You can see the kangaroos and the koalas. You can see the sea lions right there on the beach. You can witness nature as it's meant to be. There are not many places in the world that remain as untouched as the Great Australian Bight, the coastline and our beaches in Kangaroo Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary industries in regional South Australia, fishing and tourism, are very concerned at what drilling in the bight would mean for them. They are worried about the impacts of seismic testing, which is the first threat before drilling occurs. They are absolutely terrified that, if the government agency and the federal government allow drilling to continue and to take hold in the bight, if there were a spill that entire area would be decimated. Our industries would never recover. The wild coastline in the Great Australian Bight, particularly along the head of the bight and throughout the beautiful little islands that sit offshore and Kangaroo Island, are so hard to reach that it would never be properly cleaned up. No matter how much money was spent, no matter how many hundreds and hundreds of hours the workers spent out there trying to clean it up, there are places that would never be reached. So they would remain full of sludge. The fish, the birds and the marine life would simply suffocate and die. No wonder there is no social licence in my home state, in South Australia, to allow drilling to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that traditional owners don't support drilling in the bight; in fact, they are horrified that their special place is under threat. We know that the environmental experts and scientists have been warning for quite some time that this is a risk we should not take. Rather than putting at risk the Great Australian Bight, rather than impacting on the migratory path of the southern right whales, sperm whales or New Zealand fur seals, we should in fact be protecting this special place properly, giving it World Heritage protection and celebrating that it is a most unique marine wonderland. But this government, sadly backed by the Labor opposition to date, is willing to put all of that at risk for the sake of letting a handful of multinational oil and gas companies come in and drill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no social licence for this activity in my home state, in South Australia. Thirteen local councils have all voted in opposition to allowing this to happen. Kangaroo Island was the first local council to formally express their opposition, and since then many more councils have joined them. Even people in the more metro areas in Adelaide, our metro beaches—Glenelg, Semaphore, Brighton, Grange, Kingston—are extremely concerned about what it would mean for them if they had oil lapping up onto the sands in their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this risk is real. Both BP and Equinor, the companies asking to be allowed to do this, have been forced to release their own modelling. They had to do a risk assessment of what their activities would mean for the area. Both of those models from the companies themselves show that the risk of an oil spill is just too great to take. They show that the worst-case scenario, which would be the worst in history, is that it would never recover. But, even less than that, below the worst-case scenario, South Australia's coastline would be decimated and oil would wash up right past Victoria to Tasmania, Bondi Beach and Port Macquarie. This is an issue that affects Australians across the board. Any Australian who relies on our healthy coastline and beaches and any Australian who enjoys visiting and spending time at our coast should be very, very concerned about what will happen if these big multinational companies get the tick from the government, allowing them to drill for oil in the coming year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know already that our fishing and tourism industries would be decimated. And many of them would just never recover. In the worst-case scenario, half of the oil and all of the natural gas from the deepwater release would remain in the water column. It would literally suffocate and kill the animals living in that ocean. The official modelling from these companies indicates that a spill would impact many matters of national environmental significance, including up to 177 marine species, 47 species classified as vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered, and 50 coastal wetlands. Thirty-eight marine reserves would be covered in sludge. This would result in the mortality of hundreds of thousands of seabirds, thousands of marine animals, including endangered southern right whales, blue whales, killer whales, dolphins, endemic and endangered Australian sea lions and New Zealand fur seals. Hundreds of sea turtles would be dead. Hundreds—potentially thousands—of kilometres of shoreline would be covered in oil, causing extreme harm to both the birds that live on the coast and those that visit nearby. The significant injury is expected to be exceptionally diverse and unique, and, as I've said previously, cleaning this mess up would be virtually impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a risk worth taking. We don't need a multinational or foreign company to come and drill for oil in our Great Australian Bight only to send that oil offshore, along with their profits, with very little benefit to the local economy and, indeed, Australia. We know some of the oil from the bight will not be burnt in Australia—in fact, most of it won't be. That is why it makes Minister Canavan's statement—and I see he's sitting in the chamber today—that we need this oil drilling to occur in order to lower petrol prices in Australia simply ludicrous. Even if they started to drill for oil next year, if the Labor and the Liberal parties allowed Equinor to go ahead with this, it wouldn't be at a commercially viable point for at least a decade. And, even then, that oil would be shipped offshore. The profits would be shipped offshore. Australians would see none of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of local jobs: well, there aren't any—the companies have said that themselves. Maybe, there would be five or six—very, very few jobs. The companies have said themselves that they will be flying in the skilled workers that they need. Why would we risk the jobs in our tourism and fishing industries to let a foreign company drill for oil when all the money is simply going offshore?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this weren't bad enough, let me just draw your attention to the impact that this oil will have on climate change. We are living in an era of global warming as we speak. There is no future on a dead planet. And, if we were to allow this extraction of oil to occur at the volumes being proposed, we would never arrest climate change—not here in Australia and not around the rest of the world. Just a fraction of the oil reserves in the Great Australian Bight would amount to three gigatonnes of CO2. This is almost equivalent to one-third of our entire carbon budget between now and 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to keep temperature rise at two degrees—and we've been told by scientists that we have to do more than that—the IPCC report says we have to phase out fossil fuels. We can't keep playing games with our environment and the climate. It is time to get serious about what needs to be done. We have to reduce our carbon emissions and we have to stop the further extraction of fossil fuels that are only going to make climate change worse and more dangerous. If we are to do what the scientists say is required—and that is to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees or below—there is absolutely no way we can allow the extraction of fossil fuels from the Great Australian Bight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am of the generation which has already seen the effects of climate change. Many of us in this chamber are collectively responsible for this. We can see the effects of climate change already. But we are also the last generation of policymakers and decision-makers who can do anything about it. It is up to us to make the hard decisions to reduce dangerous global warming. And the more we twiddle our thumbs and the more we deny this, the harder and harder it becomes—and near impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to protect the Great Australian Bight because I know that the marine life there is precious and that it is not worth putting at risk our local industries in South Australia. As a South Australian, I am proud and very protective of our beautiful Kangaroo Island. But, as a mother, I have a responsibility to do everything I can to help stop dangerous global warming. And that means standing up to these big fossil-fuel companies and their spruikers and puppets—some of whom are here in the chamber today—from blindly dragging Australia into a climate emergency that we won't be able to reverse out of. If we are to tackle climate change, we can have no drilling for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight. We may as well tell the international community that Australia is prepared to fry. Our oceans will be decimated, our animals killed and our planet will die unless we do something about it, and the time to do something about it is now. If we continue to wait, if we continue to delay, not only will the whales lose but the whole planet will start to choke. We have to stand up strongly and say no—no drilling in the Great Australian Bight.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak on a very important issue in the Australian oil and gas industry and what it contributes to our country, and why it deserves a commonsense approach to its regulation and oversight. The government will not be supporting this bill from the Australian Greens, the Great Australian Bight Environment Protection Bill 2016, primarily because this bill is an anti-science bill. It is a bill that does not want to look at the evidence. It is a bill that does not want to adopt a commonsense approach to the development of the natural resources in this country, because it doesn't want to engage in any kind of evidence; it simply wants to prohibit, to ban, an activity that is safely carried out in this country and has been done so for decades—more than 50 years, in fact, and I'll go through that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is typical of an agenda that is often run by the Australian Greens that they don't want to engage in the detailed investigation of individual and specific projects in this country. Instead, they want to put blanket bans on any kind of activity right around the country, because they know that if they had to get to the guts of the evidence, of the data on what has actually occurred in the past, they would lose that debate. So, instead of engaging in the hard work of looking at specific projects and what their specific impact on the local environment would be—and what the impact of not doing the developments would be—they simply propose bills that seek to prohibit activity over wide swathes of Australia and deny particularly local communities the opportunity to benefit from the development of their resources. The reason they don't want to engage in that science—and I think we can all agree that science is basically about looking at evidence, particularly looking at past experience and making reasoned judgements on that experience and on that evidence; it is evidence based—is that the evidence would show their arguments to be the bunkum that they are; they would show the arguments that Senator Hanson-Young has just put in this chamber to be absolute bunkum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would, for the first time, establish a complete ban of oil and gas activities over an area of Australia—not based on any evidence, not based on any investigation or consultation with those local communities, but based instead on an unelected, unrepresentative fiat from the Australian Greens, who represent perhaps 10 per cent of Australia's population. Instead, we should be evaluating things on a case-by-case basis. I would like to spend a bit of time in my contribution discussing the example and the evidence of the production of oil and gas in Australia in the past 50 years or more. Over the past 50 years, thousands of wells have been drilled in offshore areas across Australia with no major incident whatsoever. They've been drilled safely, because we have a very strict and robust regulatory regime to do that. In fact, it is an independent regime. It's a regime that's not controlled by the minister or the government; it is controlled by an organisation called NOPSEMA, who take their job very seriously—and I'll have more to say about NOPSEMA later in my contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also really important to this debate is that a lot of that drilling, around 1,000 drills, has occurred in the Bass Strait—just south of Melbourne, just south of a major city in Australia, and also a very important environment—and nothing serious has occurred over 50 years, because there's a well-regulated process, and it's based on science. Australian workers who are involved in this industry take their job very seriously. I think it's a great denigration by the Australian Greens of our great Australian workforce who work in these industries and, day by day, deal with the risks and natural environments in a way that is safe to the environment and also incredibly productive for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically in the Great Australian Bight area, nowhere did Senator Hanson-Young mention the fact that wells have been drilled in the Great Australian Bight before. If the Australian Greens and Senator Hanson-Young were going to take an evidence based, scientific approach to this debate, they would engage with that evidence and explain why, given that we have safely drilled in the Great Australian Bight before, it needs to be banned today when it wasn't banned, obviously for the past 40-odd years. I think the first well was drilled there in 1972. In fact, 13 wells have been drilled in the Great Australian Bight, all without incident and under the proper and independent regulatory system that we have in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great contributions that have been made by our oil and gas industry, the Australian oil and gas industry, is its contribution to our national security and to our domestic security over oil and gas. It's something that I think, unfortunately, is not commented on enough, perhaps because we've taken it for granted too much in the past. But in fact, for most of the last 50-odd years, we have had quite secure supplies of oil and gas in Australia, principally because of the productive fields of the Bass Strait, which began to be developed in the 1960s. After the 1960s, of course, we had the 1970s—that usually is the way it follows—and in the 1970s we had an oil crisis around the world where a lot of countries did not have access to oil because of the creation of OPEC, which is still, obviously, in existence today. But Australia was somewhat insulated from that process thanks to the oil and gas production we had in the Bass Strait. We had sufficient supplies of oil here in Australia. We did not have the petrol rationing that had to occur in the United States, and, of course, we benefited from the terms of trade changes that occurred when oil prices went up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem for us is that we no longer have the oil security we had in the past. We should no longer be taking it for granted, because in the past 20 years our demand for oil has continued to grow as our economy has grown, and economic activities continue to demand the use of oil for certain activities, particularly transport. However, our production of oil has fallen rapidly. Indeed, over the last 20 years, our demand for petroleum products has increased by 35 per cent but our production has fallen by 65 per cent, principally because the Bass Strait is no longer producing much petroleum or oil at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put this in stark relief here, on the eve of September 11, now 17 years ago, Australia produced enough petroleum to meet 95 per cent of our domestic needs, so 95 per cent of our domestic needs could have been met from domestic production. Of course, some of that production was exported, and we imported petroleum and refined oil products from other parts of the world, but back then, if the worst had happened and our supplies of oil or hydrocarbons from the rest of the world had been cut, we would have had enough domestically to survive. It's a different story now. Now we only produce enough oil and gas for 48 per cent of our domestic petroleum needs, so we've gone from 95 per cent on the eve of September 11 to 48 per cent. Less than half now is produced through domestic production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That should be a wake-up call for our country. We are an island nation. We sit at the bottom of the world, where, fortunately, we have access to largely free and open trade routes, but we should not and cannot always take that for granted. There is always, of course, the risk of things going wrong, and the old saying is correct that we should hope for the best but prepare for the worst. The worst for our country in this regard would be the cutting of those supply chains, which would immediately, overnight, cause us to have to reduce our oil and gas consumption by more than half—possibly more given that we don't refine a lot of the product here either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll get to the Great Australian Bight in more detail in a second, but when the Australian Greens bring to the parliament a bill that says, 'Let's just ban any opportunity for us to develop one of the most prospective areas for oil and gas production in the world or to have it as an insurance policy against the worst happening,' you'd think they would engage in that argument when we say, 'Why are you proposing something which would make us potentially more vulnerable if trade and access to oil and gas from overseas were cut, which would mean we would fail to have sufficient oil to run not only our military needs—the submarines that we're building in South Australia, our fighter planes and our tanks—but also basic transport needs in a crisis?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Greens do not even engage in this debate. They have no response to this issue: what would your alternative be if we're not going to develop our own domestic supplies of oil and gas and become more reliant over time? The strategy of the Australian Greens is that they want to continue to cut oil and gas production right across Australia. They don't support it anywhere in Australia. If that's going to be their end game, how are we going to make that up if the worst happens? There is no response on that issue from the Australian Greens. That argument alone should be reason enough for the Senate to say no to this bill, because there is not much more an important issue than making sure that we can defend our nation and protect Australians from the worst outcomes that might occur around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were to develop a new oil and gas basin, it would be a major economic boost to our country as well, which is also an important reason to back the development of our natural resources. We are an incredibly prosperous nation, thanks almost primarily to the fact that we have an ability to turn our natural resources into wealth-demanding products—products that people demand around the world—whether it's our iron ore, our coal, our soils or our agricultural industry. Our tourism assets are also natural resources but do need economic development to attract people to them and, likewise, in this case our oil and gas assets. It's very important for our country to responsibly develop these assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted while I was sitting here that Senator Hanson-Young originally claimed there wouldn't be any local jobs at all created from the development of the Great Australian Bight. That's on the record. I think Senator Hanson-Young may have picked herself up and thought that might be a bit too extreme, so she might have given the oil and gas industry five or six jobs—half a dozen jobs. This is demonstrably ridiculous and absurd because we have an oil and gas industry right now. We can see the jobs it provides. This is another example of the Greens not listening to the evidence and just deciding to pass legislation based on a motion, not any evidence, facts or figures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, our oil and gas industry employs thousands of people around the country. You can go to Traralgon, Gippsland and Melbourne and see the thousands of people who work in the Bass Strait in that industry. Mr Acting Deputy President Dean Smith, one can go to your part of the country, the great state of Western Australia, to Karratha and Port Hedland, and see the thousands of people who are employed in our oil and gas industry there. Indeed, they're right around the country, including in my electorate. I'm always surprised how many people in my electorate, in Central Queensland, travel over to Western Australia every fortnight or every month or so to work in the iron ore industry but also in the oil and gas industry. It is an employer, right around the country, of thousands of people. So to come to this place and say that, if we were to develop a major oil and gas basin which could produce two to six billion barrels of oil on the current evidence we have, it would somehow only employ half a dozen people locally is demonstrably absurd. Again, if Senator Hanson-Young were to engage in the evidence, she would have seen—and probably has seen—reports showing that ACIL Allen, a respectable economic analysis agency, has recently estimated how many jobs could be created by the development of the Great Australian Bight. They found that more than 2,000 jobs would be created in construction alone from the development of the Great Australian Bight. It would add $3 billion to $12 billion to the national economy, which would be a huge boost, particularly for South Australia, which is of great importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that we need to balance the issues here. Of course, we do need to have an incredibly robust system to protect the environment—I'll come to what we're doing, if I have time, in a second—but we also need to recognise the local communities that do want those jobs, that economic opportunity and a future for their children and grandchildren in their local towns, doing something which is of great importance to the world. It's obviously of great importance: people pay a lot of money for oil and gas, so they must need it. It must be an essential input to people's lives right across the world, given the price it gets. We can be part of that. We can take pride in supplying an important energy source to the world. As I said before, people have great respect for the workers in this industry, who often spend a long time away from their family in a very tough environment and do a tough job, and it does produce enormous benefits for the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently—again it's something Senator Hanson-Young failed to mention in her contribution—we had local government elections in South Australia, where this was a live issue. Greenpeace in particular ran a strong campaign trying to elect councillors across the areas who were opposed to the development of the Great Australian Bight, but that was not the result. Senator Hanson-Young mentioned Kangaroo Island. I've been to Kangaroo Island. It's a lovely, lovely place. The new mayor there, Michael Pengilly, has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, he doesn't oppose the development of the Great Australian Bight. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… my view is very strongly that the environmental lobby have successfully run a great fear campaign against it. Everybody is environmentally conscious these days but you need to have some clarity and common sense. Our economy revolves around the oil industry, we have to have energy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And Michael does speak common sense. The new Mayor of the City of Port Lincoln, Brad Flaherty, also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These sorts of things aren't going to be a real priority for us. The priority for us is making sure the council is efficient and effective in its actions towards looking after the ratepayer base … ensuring that the city is sustainable and viable going forward into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Flaherty says that he is pro employment and pro business and wants to see those opportunities for his area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I too want to see local towns be able to take those opportunities. I want to see them take those opportunities, as I say, under a robust and strong environmental protection environment. That is why, as the minister for resources, I've made decisions to strengthen the oversight of NOPSEMA on the oil and gas industry, to make sure we continue to improve our environmental protection, because we can always do that and do things better. For example, in November last year, I announced that all environmental plans on oil and gas developments will now be made fully public—there will be full transparency of those. We have already drafted amendments to the offshore oil and gas regulations in that regard. They're out for consultation at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am thankful for the fact that Equinor, the company that are proposing to drill in the Great Australian Bight, have already committed to release their environmental plans in full, despite it not being a statutory requirement yet. They're pre-empting the changes, and that is a good thing. They will release all their modelling, all their evidence, for public consultation. It will be all out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also making sure that we fund further research into the impact, potentially, of seismic testing on our seafood industries in particular and more broadly on the natural environment. Recently there's been a comprehensive review by Geoscience Australia of the existing evidence, and the CSIRO has just completed a study on the impact of seismic testing on zooplankton. We've now provided extra funding to the Australian Institute of Marine Science to look at how seismic testing might impact fish and pearl oysters as well. That research is being conducted at the moment. Again, we will be guided—and NOPSEMA I know are guided—by the science, by the evidence. They will not approve anything that has a materially detrimental impact on the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the reason we have these stringent regulations, and the reason I have made decisions to strengthen those and strengthen that oversight, is that there are risks associated with the development of oil and gas. There are risks associated with pretty much everything we do in life, whether it's construction in a city or it's farming, mining or building a factory. All of these things have risks associated with them. The proper approach to those risks, though, is to properly manage, mitigate and assess them and also to balance them, of course, with the risks of not doing anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's something that, unfortunately, the Australian Greens simply have not engaged in in this debate: the risks of not doing anything. If we do not develop our oil and gas resources, what does that mean for the national security of this country? If we do not develop our oil and gas industries, what does that mean for the accessibility and affordability of petrol for Australians? It's a demonstrable fact that those countries that produce petrol have cheaper petrol because they don't have to transport it, and they refine it close to where they are. It is cheaper for them because of that. I think those risks of not developing are serious. They are serious risks that go to the heart of our national security and go to the heart of the cost of living of millions of Australian households, and they need to be properly assessed and weighed up against the risks on the other side of this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have successfully managed those risks under an independent regulatory regime for the past 50 years. I'm confident that we'll continue to strengthen that regime to improve on the outcomes for the oil and gas sector, and we'll do so in a way which also helps to support thousands of Australians to have a good, high-wage job in an industry that is an amazing development in our modern economy. Some of the smartest people in the world work in this industry. Some people say that the deep-sea drilling that occurs across the world, including in Australia, is the scientific equivalent of taking a man to the moon. It is that complex, that detailed, and I'm proud of the fact that we have an industry in this country—such a scientifically demanding industry—which leads the world. It leads the world in offering high-paying jobs for Australians who just want to work hard and provide for their families, and it leads the world in making sure that we protect the environment while also supporting a strong economy for millions of Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  Labor shares the concerns of the community regarding the protection of the Great Australian Bight, it's wonderful adjacent coastal environment and, indeed, it's endemic marine diversity. It has a wonderful role as a nursery and migration zone for whales and other important marine animals and it's important in the life cycle of the oceans both for sardine and other small pelagic fish breeding. There's no doubt about the importance of the Great Australian Bight as a marine ecosystem and as a wilderness, but so too for many other parts of Australia where both industry and the marine environment exist side by side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants to support an offshore oil and gas industry which is well operated and regulated. Indeed, I have very much seen this to be true in the case of my own home state of Western Australia. It is possible because of the strict and stringent oversight and approvals, which are world-leading best practice. It is absolutely the job of regulators to ensure that there are no unacceptable risks to the marine and coastal environment of the Great Australian Bight off South Australia or, frankly, any other part of our marine ecosystems where there are proposals for oil and gas exploration or mining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, from the way that Senator Hanson-Young spoke about the prospect of oil drilling in South Australia, you would have thought that, because of the scale of industry that exists in Western Australia, we have beaches and marine ecosystems swamped with oil and sludge as if it was some kind of inevitable consequence of allowing industry anywhere in Australia. As a Western Australian, I feel this very strongly. I recognise the Great Australian Bight as unique and important geoscientifically. It's deep and it has got very particular marine protection attributes in terms of the species there, but so does Western Australia. It is absolutely ridiculous that the Greens think that they can single out addressing climate change and environmental protection in our nation by refusing to engage in the substantive policy debates about how we regulate these industries and, frankly, also about how we manage emissions, which will still continue to take place at the North West Shelf and in many other parts of Australia's oil and gas industry. It's simply an act of putting your head in the sand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to the sustainable management of Australia's marine resources and, indeed, we want to be strong defenders and managers of our oceans and those who use them. I note, in relation to what Senator Hanson-Young proposes in this legislation, that it prohibits mining operations in the Great Australian Bight marine area and that the object of the bill, they argue, is to protect regional industries which rely on its waters from damage resulting from mining activities. Surely that is something that should and must be assessed for every industry and every proposed mining project in Australia. It is the job of NOPSEMA to do this on behalf of our environment and these industries nationwide, for the Great Australian Bight, for the North West Shelf—for all of our offshore oil and gas developments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to outline Labor's position on the government's Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. Labor supports these bills. However, in saying that, I will raise a number of concerns. But, firstly, I would like to thank the minister for facilitating a briefing to Labor on this bill. We are grateful that he extended that invitation. These bills are a consequence of the Carnell-Paterson review that was handed to the government in October last year. The Carnell-Paterson review recommended bringing together the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. This was one of 10 recommendations included in the Carnell-Paterson review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 is to establish a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission from 1 January 2019. The new commission will be tasked to help restore the confidence of aged-care consumers in the delivery of aged-care services given the context of recent public concern. The new commission will provide a single point of contact for aged-care consumers and providers of aged care in relation to quality of care and regulation. It will be responsible for accreditation, assessment and monitoring, and complaints handling of aged-care services and Commonwealth funded aged-care services. These aged-care services include all four areas of aged-care services—residential aged care, home care, flexible care services, the Commonwealth Home Support Program and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new commission will be led by a statutorily appointed Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner, who will be advised by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council. The commissioner will be appointed for a term of five years. The bill also establishes that the commissioner may seek and consider clinical advice. This would take the form of an expert clinical panel that would support the work of the commission. I also acknowledge that funding of $16 million will be allocated to the new commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, provides for the administrative matters required to transfer the functions and operations of the existing authorities to the commission. This bill also provides for the continuation of the appointments of the members of the existing Aged Care Quality Advisory Council for the remainder of their current term as new members of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned that Labor has a number of concerns regarding these bills. Firstly, we on this side are concerned about the length of time it's taken the government to introduce legislation into the parliament. The Carnell-Paterson review was handed to the government almost a year ago. This is unacceptable. It is now November, and this new commission is set to be operational in around eight weeks. Why has there been a hold-up? Labor has not at any stage impeded the passage of this legislation being introduced into the House. We know that the bills are important in restoring the confidence of older Australians, their families and carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As already mentioned by the shadow minister in the other place, these bills are also a missed opportunity for the government to give the new commission stronger arbitrary powers given the level of public concern in relation to service providers. What the public don't want to see is another toothless tiger. Labor believes it is a shortfall of the government that it didn't consider giving the new commission greater arbitrary powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the introduction of these bills into the parliament, the government has announced it will establish a royal commission into aged care. Labor supports the royal commission, but the Liberals can't wait for the royal commission to finish before they start genuine reform to fix the aged-care crisis made under their watch. I also want to take this opportunity to raise the terms of reference for the royal commission. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister wrote to the Prime Minister back in September to request the broadening of the terms of reference. We are pleased that the Prime Minister listened to Labor and adopted a number of the suggestions we put forward, including long-term sustainability of the sector, funding and the aged-care workforce. Of some disappointment was the Prime Minister not supporting the inclusion of retirement village living as part of the terms of reference. We know that older Australians living in retirement villages are increasingly receiving home care services. We are also pleased that there is an opportunity for the royal commission to examine the impact of the Liberals' years of cuts. You don't fix aged care by cutting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been saying for a long time that the aged-care system is in a state of national crisis. When the Leader of the Opposition said this in the parliament in May, the government likened it to committing elder abuse. We are glad that they are now listening and have changed their minds. There have been more than a dozen inquiries, reports and reviews into the aged-care sector which the government hasn't acted on, many of which have been sitting on the desk in front of the minister. There have been three ministers in five years. They have known about the problems. They have known that this sector has been progressing towards a crisis but have done little, if anything, to act. With three ministers in five years and billions cut, the government has ignored dozens of its own reports and reviews on what is needed to fix the problems we know about with aged care. We already know what the problems are. These reviews and reports have been allowed to collect dust instead of being acted on. Instead of the minister acting on reform and responding to the plethora of reviews, reports and inquiries, we now have an aged-care crisis and a royal commission. This royal commission is an admission by this government that it hasn't done enough and hasn't driven the reform it should have. This is totally unacceptable. We can't call ourselves a fair and generous country until we give elderly Australians the love, care and respect that they deserve. Whilst the chaotic and divided Liberals have fought amongst themselves, the care of older Australians has been neglected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the inaction on the reform, we've seen billions of dollars cut from the aged-care sector. This has not helped a sector in crisis. The Prime Minister has been the architect of cuts that have gutted aged care and put the sector under immense pressure. As Treasurer, in his first budget alone, he was responsible for ripping $1.2 billion from the care of older Australians. You cannot rip almost $2 billion out of the aged-care sector over five years and not have an impact on quality. No wonder the system is in crisis! Those opposite must explain to the Australian people how these continuous cuts to the aged-care budget have contributed to the crisis we now face in aged care. Why did the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, sign off on a $1.2 billion cut in the 2016 budget? It is deeply concerning that the Liberals responded with cuts, not compassion. Those opposite willingly cut aged-care funding because they don't value older Australians. The Prime Minister must take responsibility for these cuts that are now impacting on the care of older Australians. It's the right thing to do. You only have to look at the budget papers signed off by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. His name is on these papers, in black and white. These are the cuts that he is denying. Page 101 of Budget Paper No. 2 of 2016-17 says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 billion over four years …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians deserve much more than a Prime Minister who cuts funding to aged care and then lies to them about it. Embarrassingly, the Prime Minister continues to crab crawl away from his own cuts. The Prime Minister is pretending he is a recently interested bystander and not one of the key figures in a government that has been responsible for the cuts and for the aged-care crisis that has occurred under the Liberals' watch. The Liberals are too busy fighting amongst themselves to focus on what matters. It's time the Liberals started doing better in this critical area of policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a bit of time talking about the aged-care reform or, more importantly, the lack of aged-care reform. There is no doubt that there are a lot of things this government needs to do when it comes to aged-care reform. In September this year the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for ageing and I held a round table with around 40 of Australia's leading aged-care experts. This was an opportunity not only for Labor to learn and listen about the issues and challenges but also for us to seek advice about short- and long-term solutions so that we can ensure older Australians are able to access a range of services with dignity and choice. We know from these conversations there is a lot of work to do. Four hours wasn't long enough to talk about all that needs to be done. It is obvious that the government has dragged its feet on reform. It has been slow paced and has mismanaged every part of the reform process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are very concerned about is that the government is going to cease doing anything around aged-care reform and wait for the conclusion of the royal commission. This won't do. It won't do because the government is already five years behind on the reform front. Take, for instance, the Carnell-Paterson report. It's been over a year since the release of the report on the aged-care regulation, and in this time the Liberals have done too little to progress this important body of work. The Liberal government has fully implemented just one—just one!—of the report's 10 recommendations. Labor called for the implementation of the one recommendation the government has introduced—unannounced accreditation audits for residential aged-care facilities—six months before the government adopted it. Legislation to enact another of the review's recommendations—the creation of a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission—is only being debated in the Senate today. The new commission is meant to begin on 1 January 2019. There's not a lot of time for the government to get their act together. To date, the Liberals have responded to less than half of the recommendations of the Tune review into aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inaction fits the pattern of the Liberal government, which has sat on more than a dozen reports and reviews into the aged-care sector and done very little. It is crucial to the future of the aged-care sector that families have faith and confidence that their loved ones will be safe and receive high-level care in residential homes. The Prime Minister and the Liberals need to do better—much, much, better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the work around the workforce that hasn't even been started. The minister sat on the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce report <span style="font-style:italic;">A matter of care</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>for more than two months after the chair, John Pollaers, handed this strategy to him. Ironically, this strategy was only made public after the shadow minister sent out a media release having a go at the minister for sitting on this reform document. Of great concern is that the government has yet to commit any funding to this strategy. How does the government expect to drive reform without providing additional funding? We know there aren't enough aged-care workers. We know aged-care workers aren't given enough pay, respect or support. We also know there needs to be greater focus on training and education. But that report is sitting idle instead of being implemented and made operational. This is deeply concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care workforce is expected to increase by 300 per cent in the next 30 years, underscoring the challenges and opportunities of getting this right. Labor has called on the government to immediately implement the workforce strategy and thanks the chair of this report, John Pollaers, for his important work. We also believe that the government must work with the unions and the aged-care providers to implement this strategy to meet growing demand. This strategy must consider issues such as the proposal for 24-hour registered-nurse coverage at residential aged-care homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to staffing arrangements in residential aged-care homes, the role of nurses and personal-care workers in the care of older Australians is critical and will only become increasingly important. Labor also understands the important role of other health professionals, such as GPs, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and dietitians. All have a very important role overall in the wellbeing of older Australians. We will need to see a tripling of the aged-care workforce in the next 30 years to provide a high standard of living and care for this growing proportion of older Australians. Whether it is from the aged-care providers, workers or consumers, the message has been consistent: this government must take action to ensure we have an adequately skilled and equipped aged-care workforce to care for our rapidly ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area mismanaged by this government is the home care package waiting list. Outside of residential aged care we have the majority of older Australians, who are receiving care in their homes. Under the government's watch, there are now more than 121,000 people on the home care package waiting list—including 96,000 people with high needs, many living with dementia. Around 56,000 of these older Australians waiting have no home care package at all. It's a disgrace. As I've said, the release of the June 2018 data sadly reveals that there are now more than 121,000 older Australians waiting for a home care package. These numbers are shocking. It is now clear that the government and the minister have failed to curb the growing home care package waiting list and are not doing enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A bigger concern is that the minister has deliberately delayed releasing the March and June data. The March data was delayed by more than three months. The June data was also delayed. The government continues to cherrypick its way through the figures so as to paint a rosy picture rather than to reveal the reality of the waiting list. This is a sad reflection on the government and on how it prioritises the care of the most vulnerable Australians. It doesn't matter how the government and the minister try to spin their data, the numbers are clear: there are more than 121,000 people still waiting for care. The average wait time, according to the government's data, for a level 3 or level 4 package is still more than 12 months. We know that some older Australians have been waiting more than two years for care. The Department of Health has previously committed to releasing the data two months after the period that the data covers. To delay the data without any reason is intolerable and unacceptable. There is no excuse for continuing to delay the release of any future data. I note that the next round of data should be due any week now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does support these bills. We also remain committed to working with the government and the aged-care sector to ensure that older Australians can age safely, happily and with dignity, whether that is in residential care homes or in their own home. Labor again puts the government on notice that, even though it has announced a royal commission into aged care, it must continue all of the important reform work it has before it. I would also like to put on record my thanks to Senator Griff for his genuine interest in this area and for the good intentions of his second reading amendment. I give the senator credit for what he is trying to do, but Labor will not be supporting the amendment being put forward. Again, I reiterate: Labor will be supporting these bills, but we put the government on notice: I really don't want to see the next round of data, which is due anytime, released on Christmas Eve.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018—to be referred to as the commission bill from here in—as well as the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. The Australian Greens broadly support these two bills. However, we consider that some amendments are required in order to strengthen the legislation, provide further protections for aged-care consumers and strengthen the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission and its powers. The commission bill establishes the new independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission—to be referred to as the commission for the rest of my contribution—and was announced in the 2018-19 budget following the recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review. The commission will initially bring together the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. A commissioner is to be appointed by the minister to lead the commission, and the commission bill sets out the various functions of the commissioner, including the consumer engagement function, complaints functions, regulatory functions and education functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the commission will allow a more holistic approach and better oversight of the aged-care sector as a whole, where information will flow more readily and easily throughout the commission, allowing better identification of where the risks and issues are, and for these to inform decision-making rather than being siloed into various agencies and the Department of Health. This will allow better analysis of the data being collected, assist in working out why there are certain trends, help drive quality improvement and enable innovation to ensure a better quality of life for older Australians and uphold their human rights. Given recent incidents that have played out in the media, it is incredibly important that we get the commission bill right so that older Australians, providers and the public have confidence in the aged-care sector and are clear on the purpose and the role of the commission and so that there are fewer grey areas than currently exist. From 1 January 2020 the aged-care regulatory functions of the Department of Health, including the approval of aged-care providers' compliance and compulsory reporting of assaults, will transition to the commission. A separate bill will be needed to transfer the regulatory functions from the department, and the Australian Greens understand that this bill is anticipated to be introduced and debated some time during 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An overarching concern for us is that the bill does not refer to the human rights of older Australians and instead refers to their consumer rights. At the hearing for the inquiry into these bills, Mr Mitchell of the National Older Persons Legal Services Network—a network of national associations of community legal centres—said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The national association notes that the bills engage older Australians from the perspective of consumers and build a guarantee of a quality base within the frame of consumer rights. The various incidents, inquiries, reports and reviews that have led us to this point in time have been very clearly about the human rights of older persons. The national association respectfully submits that the framing of rights expectations for older persons within the regulatory framework of aged care should be on the basis of inherent human rights, acknowledging the interdependence and interconnectedness of those rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens believe that the human rights of older Australians will be a strong focus of the upcoming royal commission and that there is a need for these rights to be acknowledged in the commission bill. I will be moving an amendment to include reference to human rights in the object of the commission bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our additional comments to the inquiry into these two bills, we outlined that we consider that the commission bill should include reference to the Chief Clinical Adviser and specify that the Chief Clinical Adviser's role should have responsibility for overseeing and monitoring restrictive practices on medication management. We cannot envisage a time when the Chief Clinical Adviser's position will not be needed and are of the view that the requirement for certainty for the position into the future outweighs the need for flexibility that was articulated in the minister's second reading speech on the commission bill. We are pleased to see that the government will be amending the commission bill to reference the role of the Chief Clinical Adviser, establishing that the commissioner will be required to appoint a person for this position to assist them in the performance of their function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to restrictive practices, the Carnell-Paterson review recommended that the commission have oversight of the use of restrictive practices in residential aged care. While the Carnell-Paterson review also recommended that the Chief Clinical Adviser have responsibility for reviewing the use of antipsychotic medications, the Australian Greens would be satisfied with the Chief Clinical Adviser having oversight and monitoring responsibilities for restrictive practices and medication management in the first instance. This is extremely important. We need to ensure that there is someone responsible for ensuring that restrictive practices are used only as a last resort and in the least restrictive way, as well as someone advocating and pursuing the elimination of their use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medication management is also desperately in need of oversight. At the hearing for the inquiry into the bills, Dr Kidd, the chair of the Australian Medical Association Council of General Practice, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the cases of abuse and neglect in aged-care settings involve inadequate clinical care. The clinical care accreditation standard was the single highest outcome not met by residential aged-care facilities in 2016-17, followed by the medication management standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to improve on this. We are pleased to see that the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the commission bill outlines a number of possibilities for the scope of work for the Chief Clinical Adviser, including best practice clinical care, minimising infection-related risks, clinical governance and the use of restraints. While we will not be seeking to amend the commission bill today to specify the scope of the Chief Clinical Adviser's role, we will be keeping a close eye on the development of this position following the commission's establishment and may seek to deal with this during the debate on the next bill in the new year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our additional comments to the report on the inquiry into these two bills we outlined our concerns regarding the commission being referred to as 'a single point of contact for older Australians and their families' given the commission will be unable to receive complaints about My Aged Care or the assessment processes. We argued that the government should not be separating the processes of assessment and determination of eligibility from service delivery. We think this is illogical, as they are entwined with one another. The commission's complaints function should be broadened to allow older Australians and their families to lodge complaints with the commission about their experiences with My Aged Care and the assessment teams. I will be asking the government about this during the committee stage. We understand that this issue is somewhat complex; however, the Australian Greens, at a minimum, want to see this issue resolved in the next bill next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the commissioner's consumer engagement and education functions, the Australian Greens raised concerns in our additional comments regarding the lack of reference to representatives of consumers in clause 17 of the commission bill and the lack of reference to the workforce of providers in clause 20. In relation to the first of these concerns, COTA Australia said in its submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… many consumers of aged care services (in particular those care recipients in residential aged care) require support to be involved in these functions of the Commissioner, and indeed family and friend carers are a key and absolutely valid consumer constituency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's amendments to clause 17 address our concerns. The amendments will ensure that representatives of aged-care consumers are also consulted in relation to and are the beneficiaries of the commissioner's development of best practice models for the engagement of aged-care providers. In relation to the second of these concerns, we do not want to see the education of the workforce of providers, in the broader sense of the term, disappear once the commission is established. The specification in the supplementary explanatory memorandum that reference to aged-care providers in relation to the commissioner's education function includes their staff addresses this concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It became apparent during the hearing for the inquiry into the bill that clause 59, which provides the commissioner with the power to make information about an aged-care service publicly available, did not include the Commonwealth Home Support Program or, for that matter, any Commonwealth funded aged-care services. It is important that, once all Commonwealth funded aged-care services come under the remit of the commission, the commissioner is empowered to release information about them publicly, as they will be able to be an aged-care service. The government's amendment to include clause 59(A) to the commission bill will fix this omission. However, we have an amendment to both clauses 59 and 59(A) specifically to allow the commissioner to make information about the number of staff and the skill mix of staff of an aged-care service providing direct care to aged-care consumers publically available. This is important as we believe the current ratio of aged-care workers to aged-care consumers is too low, and this needs to be addressed. Allowing the commissioner to release such information will encourage public scrutiny of the situation and informed assessments to be made and will hopefully lead to the situation being improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We raise concerns in our additional comments regarding the consent provisions in relation to the powers of the authorised complaints officers and regulatory office officials in relation to premises. The Australian Greens believe that only aged-care consumers should be able to withhold consent if the premises are their own home and that only aged-care consumers should be able to withhold consent in residential aged-care facilities if a commission officer is there to see them. We will be asking questions during the committee stage about this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also called for a review of the legislation. In our additional comments, we suggested a review after three years. The government's amendment will cause an independent review of the operation of the act and the rules to occur within six months of the fifth anniversary of their operation. The Australian Greens support the addition of a review provision and that the report of the review will be required to be tabled in each house of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens have concerns regarding residential aged-care facilities refusing access to advocates and other formal representatives of older Australians. At a hearing for the inquiry into the bills, at least two witnesses outlined their experiences of the relevant services being refused entry on a number of occasions. We have a great deal of concern about that. The Australian Greens want to ensure that advocates and other representatives are able to enter residential aged-care facilities as appropriate. I will be asking questions during the committee stage about the issue, as it is critical that aged-care facilities do not block access to advocates and other representatives. After all, these facilities are people's homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pleased to see that the government will be amending clause 23 of the commission bill to ensure complainants won't be charged fees by the commissioner for making a complaint, nor will the commissioner have the ability to charge fees to consumers and their representatives in relation to their consumer engagement function. Likewise, we are pleased to see the government will be amending clause 41 of the commission bill to ensure that those with the experience and knowledge of issues affecting aged-care consumers be appointed as members of the advisory council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a need for clarity regarding what will be included in the next bill, due next year, specifically regarding sanctions and the enactment of a serious-incident response scheme and a quality improvement framework. I note that our friends over the ditch in New Zealand have a process for serious-incident reporting which has led, I understand, to a decrease in falls and fewer older people being admitted to hospital with hip fractures and injuries of that nature. The community affairs committee, on its recent trip to New Zealand, heard from the Health Quality and Safety Commission on this issue and on its powers to establish mortality inquiries, which have also helped. That may be something we should consider in the future here in Australia if we don't see improvements in the current situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the government for taking on board the concerns that have been raised following the inquiry into this bill, once again showing the usefulness of the Senate committee process. I'd like to thank them for the amendments they have made. We will be moving amendments to address issues they have not resolved, and, as I articulated in my contribution, we'll be asking a series of questions to clarify the operation of some elements of the commission. We will be supporting this bill. We think it will significantly improve care. We do think there is some way still to go, but we hope that, if done properly, this will make a significant contribution to improving care in this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  Centre Alliance supports this bill, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018, as I'm sure every senator and party in this place does. It puts in place a beefed-up aged-care commission as part of a new regime that we expect will provide much better oversight and regulation of aged care. This bill creates the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, which will be headed by an independent commissioner and will combine the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. Following a second tranche of legislation next year, this new entity is also expected to take on the regulatory functions of the department from 2020. This was a key recommendation of the Carnell-Paterson review of national aged-care quality regulatory processes, which was critical of the fragmented regulatory system we now have. The review itself came in the wake of the appalling treatment of vulnerable residents at Oakden, in my home state. The inexcusable conditions residents endured, the abusive and negligent treatment they suffered and the agony their families still feel are what drive us here today. Every step we take to improve the residential aged-care system is one more step towards making sure that that horror is never repeated. We support this bill and we are relieved that it doesn't end there. There are measures on the horizon for performance ratings and a general embrace of greater transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in saying we support the bill, we can also see a few areas where some minor improvements can be made. To start, we intend to amend the government's amendment, which in part provides for the role of a Chief Clinical Adviser—again, as recommended in the Carnell-Paterson review. We absolutely support the creation of this position to provide clinical leadership and assist the commissioner, but we note that the government hasn't stipulated the baseline skills required of the appointee. It is, instead, relying on the job description in the explanatory memorandum to do that. Normally that may not be an issue, but it's not a foolproof system. By way of a similar example, for about 10 months the Acting Chief Medical Officer's role in the home affairs department was filled by a senior department official who was not a doctor—this is despite the obvious description of the role—and yet she was meant to advise the department of the health issues of asylum seekers, refugees and Border Force personnel. So, while everyone fully expects that the Chief Clinical Adviser will, in fact, always be a medical specialist with expertise in aged care, I would feel more comfortable seeing it in black and white so we don't end up, somewhere down the track, with someone like a senior public servant with no medical training sitting in that important role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a second reading amendment that voices our intention that aged-care providers be required to publish on their own websites any noncompliance, notifications or sanctions they have received and to do this in a timely way. We believe this information should be on a provider's website as well as the My Aged Care website to make it easy for families and residents to check the provider's status and be able to act on it if desired. No doubt, this is something most of us agree should happen, and Centre Alliance will continue to push for this to become a reality. A recent search of the My Aged Care website showed there were 55 providers across Australia who had been issued with noncompliance notifications and 19 providers had current sanctions against them, but only one of those 19 referred to their sanction on their own home page. Sanctions can mean there was an immediate or severe risk to the health, safety and wellbeing of residents. It is self-evident that we need to make it easy for families and care recipients to know about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to flag that we will also support the Greens amendment that would allow the commission to disclose the number and type of staff employed by aged-care providers. We had planned to circulate a similar amendment to reflect a private member's bill that my colleague Rebekha Sharkie had circulated in the other place. As we know, staffing levels are a critical issue when it comes to delivering good quality aged care, including the number of nurses and allied health professionals who will ensure the ongoing health and medical needs of residents. What we saw at Oakden was the opposite of this, where abuse flourished under a regime where there were nowhere near enough skilled staff to manage the complex needs of its residents. This minor addition to the legislation is all about transparency. When it comes to staffing numbers, disclosure can be a very useful signal of whether the service is providing the level of care that is expected by us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant risks to residents from inadequate staffing numbers: increased medical errors, increased risk of bed sores and malnutrition, and higher risk of falls and choking, all leading to preventable deaths. Falls reflect a lack of adequate staffing as it means residents are getting around without sufficient assistance. Choking episodes can also reflect a lack of adequate staffing as it can indicate residents are being fed or are self-feeding without appropriate assistance. Weight loss of more than 20 per cent from admission is also a concern, especially in residents with dementia and, again, it can reflect a lack of adequate staffing as residents with dementia need to be fed because they lack the drive to feed themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is only the start of a long journey towards a better aged-care system. We expect further legislation next year and will no doubt see more reform once the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety delivers its findings in 2020. But we also know that there is more that government can do now without waiting for more reasons or more evidence. For instance, it can do much more to tackle preventable deaths, such as those caused by falls or by choking. How might this happen? Quite simply, at admission all residents should have a falls risk assessment and a plan made for managing this. All residents should also have a swallowing risk assessment and a plan made for managing this. In addition, residents should also have a pressure sore risk assessment and a plan for this. Their weight should be monitored to ensure they are eating enough and are not at risk of malnutrition. Every six months, these plans would be reviewed to ensure they are kept up with the residents' changing health and needs. We should also mandate that aged-care facilities report critical incidents, such as the rate of falls and the rates of choking per 100 residents and that these reports are made publicly available on the My Aged Care website. These are two very simple and effective measures that can move everything forward in a positive way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, this is a continuous journey of improvement, so I urge the government to continue on the positive road it's on, but to also take up more stringent monitoring of key welfare outcomes and very much the public reporting of these. Once we get that right, it means neglectful hellholes like Oakden and its ilk will have nowhere left to hide. I move:</span>

The Australian government has established a royal commission to look more broadly at the challenges facing the aged-care sector, particularly as Australia's population ages, including the quality of care provided in residential and in-home aged care. The royal commission is in addition to, not instead of, the action the government is already undertaking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government remains committed to continuing its reforms to improve safety and quality in aged-care services. This includes the establishment of a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, announced in the 2018-19 budget. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 are part of the Australian government's fundamental reforms of the aged-care system. The reforms contribute to the promotion of high-quality aged-care services that meet consumer needs and preferences and create a competitive market based system where consumers drive quality.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new, independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will be a single point of contact for aged-care consumers and providers of aged care in relation to quality of care and regulation. The commission replaces the existing Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and Aged Care Complaints Commissioner and, from 1 January 2019, will be responsible for the accreditation, assessment, monitoring and complaints handling of aged-care providers in Commonwealth funded aged-care services. The commission will also undertake consumer engagement in education of providers, consumers and the general public as part of its functions. The provision of these bills has been reviewed by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The committee conducted a thorough review of the bills in the time available, and the government thanks the committee for its support of these bills in recommending that they be passed by the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has considered the comments made in the committee's report, and I'm pleased to announce the government's response to the committee's report. The government has developed amendments to address various issues and recommendations raised in the report. These amendments form part of the government's response and will refine and clarify the government's policy intention for the commission from its commencement on 1 January 2019. The government also notes the additional recommendations and comments contained in the committee's report and is committed to considering these issues during the upcoming opportunity to make enhancements to the commission's bills as part of the second stage of reform, as signalled in the objects of the commission bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important work of the commission will also be strengthened through a number of initiatives announced in the 2018-19 budget, which will be delivered progressively over two years. This includes the development of options for a serious incident response scheme and measures to strengthen risk profiling of providers, with the aim of preventing or responding quickly to failures of care. I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate on these bills.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government proposes a number of amendments to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill. The proposed amendments address various issues raised in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into these bills. The government welcomes the committee's recommendation that the bills be passed and that establishing the commission should not be delayed. As the committee noted, there will be a further opportunity to pursue improvements in a second stage of reform, as signalled in the objects of the bill. However, after considering the issues raised in the inquiry with both the committee and stakeholders that appeared before the committee, the government considers that there are some amendments which would be appropriate to be made now, to apply from the commencement of the commission on 1 January 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will support the new commission in its role as the single point of contact for aged-care consumers and providers of aged care in relation to quality of care and regulation. These changes refine or clarify the government's policy intent to deliver more integrated and responsive regulatory oversight of the sector and contribute to the bill's objects and focus for consumers. In summary, these changes will broaden the scope of the commissioner's consumer engagement functions to include the representatives of aged-care consumers; remove the ability of the commissioner to charge fees for services to complainants and consumers for certain functions; provide for the commissioner to be supported in the performance of their functions by a chief clinical adviser appointed by the commissioner; extend eligibility for appointing members of the advisory council to include persons with experience or knowledge of issues affecting aged-care consumers or their representatives, such as informal carers; extend the commissioner's power to publish information about aged-care services to include other Commonwealth-grant-funded services; and provide for a statutory review of the operation of the act to occur in early 2024, which will be five years after the commencement of this bill and four years after the second stage of reforms foreshadowed in this bill. I commend these amendments.</span>

We thank Senator Siewert for her proposed amendment to the government amendments. The government doesn't support the proposed amendment to clause 59A of the bill for the same reasons it does not support the proposed amendments to clause 59. The government does not support the proposed amendment to include a reference to the number of staff, and the skill mix of staff, providing direct care to care recipients. There is a risk that publishing the wrong information, or information in the wrong context, will mislead consumers about what it means and adversely affect the business of providers. Additionally, appropriate arrangements must also be implemented to facilitate the commissioner receiving, analysing and reporting this information from providers and regulating its integrity. Making such an amendment before there has been an opportunity to consider and implement arrangements to support this proposal is likely to raise expectations which will not be fulfilled.</span>

Is the government proposing, as we noted in our contributions and as you yourself earlier noted, that there will be further amendments to this commission process? Is the government thinking that you will be dealing with the skill mix a bit later on? This is a really serious issue and it is going to keep coming up again and again. It is better to have a proper process in place rather than what we have now. For example, we don't even have a guarantee that we will have a nurse on 24/7, which some of us think is the absolute minimum that would be required. Recent studies have shown that the amount of contact and care hours that are required is four hours and 18 minutes, and we are nowhere near that in Australia. Those are the sorts of things the public wants to know, consumers want to know and, importantly, the families of residents in aged care particularly want to know as well.</span>

To the first part of the question, the answer is yes—that there are further reforms that have been flagged. But, in terms of the skills mix that you're specifically pointing to, the government's view is that this isn't the right act for that to be considered in and that, in fact, the Aged Care Act is where skills issues should be considered. So, in terms of the government's thinking, obviously the government will make announcements in due course, but we believe that the right place to look at those issues is in the Aged Care Act.</span>

The government is currently sitting on the Aged Care Workforce Strategy. For some months, Labor has been calling on the government to address the <span style="font-style:italic;">A matter of care</span> workforce strategy, as this should have been done immediately. Aged-care workforce development is not an optional policy area. The aged-care workforce is diverse, and we acknowledge the work that is being carried out by nurses, carers and allied health professionals. We hope that the government act on the workforce strategy that is before them. It's all there laid out for them; they just need to take some action. Labor will not be supporting the Greens amendment. We think it can be done in the future in a different piece of legislation.</span>

While I accept that there are other pieces of legislation that regulate the aged-care sector, this would enable people to at least get access to information about what's going on. As I said, we do appreciate the fact that there's a lot of work to do and that other acts would be required to specifically start regulating the process if the government were so minded. We think this would improve the operation of the commission and certainly enable the community to get better access to and understanding of what's happening in the provision of aged care.</span>

                    </a>  Hopefully they are. The government's amendments are quite wide ranging. As I articulated in my second reading contribution, we will be supporting those amendments. We're really pleased that the government responded to the Community Affairs Committee's points, raised in the inquiry, particularly a number of the points I raised in my additional comments on this report. Again, I'll just make the point that it does show the benefit of the committee inquiry process. But there are a few outstanding issues that I want to clarify. During the committee's inquiry into the bills, COTA Australia and other consumer organisations called for the proposed commission to incorporate My Aged Care and the assessment processes within the complaints purview of the commission. The government is not going to do this. Can the minister confirm that he will direct the commissioner to adopt a no-wrong-door policy and ensure that staff connect consumers with the appropriate complaint mechanism?</span>

That would be appreciated. It's one of the issues that we're keen to have better articulated, and I know consumers and their advocates want that too—a better understanding of the number of complaints and the issues in relation to My Aged Care, RAS and ACAT. What additional steps is the government taking to investigate including My Aged Care and the assessment processes within the complaints purview through the next bill? Is this being considered? If you can't answer that one, is the government prepared to consider including that in the next bill?</span>

Where entry is sought to a consumer's own home, the consumer's consent must be received before entry. Approved providers have an obligation under the Aged Care Act to cooperate and facilitate access to their premises for authorised complaints officers and regulatory officers of the commission, and failure to comply with responsibility can result in a sanction being imposed on an approved provider.

I'm advised there are existing provisions under the Aged Care Act which secure access to aged-care homes for advocates and OPAN workers. Approved providers are required to allow access as part of their responsibilities to recognise the user rights of consumers, and this includes access to advocates. These responsibilities are set out in the User Rights Principles 2014, and the department can take regulatory action if providers fail to comply.</span>

Is the government satisfied that the legislation makes it clear that only consumers will be able to withhold consent under proposed sections 66 and 69 of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill if the premises are their own home, or if the premises are a residential aged-care facility when the commission officer is there to see them specifically?</span>

The scenario that's been raised with us is where, for example, a service provider is there at the time, answers the door, denies consent and doesn't necessarily tell the resident, or the resident doesn't get the opportunity to answer. So it is to be assured that it's the resident that is saying yes or no.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments relate to the comments that I made during my second reading contribution and relate to the human rights element for older Australians. I found very convincing evidence from Mr Mitchell, which I articulated in my second reading contribution, around the human rights of older Australians. He articulated that very well and, in fact, it was just after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> reports. What we saw there were the human rights of older Australians being violated, in many people's opinion, including my own. We think it would benefit the commission if the objects of the commission included reference to older Australians' human rights. There are also very strong opinions among many people that, in fact, there needs to be an international convention on the rights of older peoples around the world. It's something that I also find very attractive and will continue to pursue. In the meantime, we think a valuable improvement to the bill and to the role of the commission would be to amend the objects to include reference to older Australians' human rights.</span>

But, while we understand the Greens' intent of these amendments, the ad hoc drafting is not sufficient and there needs to be more consultation. The government has indicated it will need to rewrite the Aged Care Act. It is best, we believe, that any amendments be done at that time, after proper consideration and after the act has been reviewed. In relation to the royal commission and the interest that the public have in the sector, we feel that it is best done, as I said, after the act has been reviewed, and therefore we won't be able to support the Greens amendments.</span>

The proposed amendment to clause 5, to include a reference to human rights, is not supported as the rights of aged-care consumers are matters dealt with under the Aged Care Act. As Senator Polley has just indicated, this bill sets up the regulatory and administrative arrangements to give effect to the rights and responsibilities under the Aged Care Act but not to create or give rights. The proposed amendment to clause 59, to include a reference to the number of staff and skill mix of staff providing direct care to care recipients, is not supported for the reasons outlined earlier.</span>

We want to ensure that the commissioner has sufficient flexibility to appoint a Chief Clinical Adviser who will best support them in performing their functions. Having substantial clinical knowledge, skills and experience is inherent within the role of Chief Clinical Adviser, as, without these skills, the person could not provide the support that the commissioner would want to have from their Chief Clinical Adviser on complex clinical issues. Specifying that the role must be performed by a medical practitioner also risks excluding other relevant clinical professionals. In addition, the government has announced that the commissioner and Chief Clinical Adviser will be supported by an expert clinical panel which would be accessed when specific complex issues emerged that required specialist expertise, advice and assessment. It is expected that the expert clinical panel would include members from a range of clinical specialties.</span>

But an aged-care provider is required to meet its obligatory requirements, and, if it doesn't, sanctions can be applied. So, technically, as to what you are saying: yes. Practically, I think it's probably a different situation. There are sanctions that can be applied if they don't meet their obligatory requirements.</span>

We've heard previously that, if people are denied access, it may take a while for the sanctions process to go through in the meantime. If somebody's raised a complaint, the timeliness of access could well be an issue. If there is a complaint and the providers deny access, it gives them time to deal with things. In fact, there needs to be more timely access.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I wish to speak in support of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2017. There are three areas where schedule 1 to the act is to be amended. These are Kakadu National Park, land within the town of Urapunga, and land within Anthony Lagoon Station, NT Portion 5010.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kakadu plan of management is an interesting and important example of where First Nations interests in land, culture and heritage can complement and enhance national park priorities of environmental management and tourism. Each stage of the park includes Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 that is leased to the Director of National Parks or land that is subject to a claim by traditional owners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. Most of the land that was to become part of stage 1 of Kakadu National Park was granted to the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in August 1978. In November 1978, 40 years ago, the lands trust and the director signed a lease agreement for the land to be managed as a national park. That was, I'm pleased to say, welcomed by the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Malcolm Fraser, who declared:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Kakadu National Park owes its existence in its present form to an unprecedented action by the traditional … owners of the area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stage 1 of the park, covering the lease land and the land required for the township of Jabiru and some adjoining lands, was also declared on 5 April 1979. These lease arrangements are also important acts of generosity from the traditional owners which must always be respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stage 2 was declared on 28 February 1984, originally as Kakadu (Stage 2) National Park and later incorporated into Kakadu National Park on 20 December 1985. In March 1978, a land claim was lodged under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act for the land included in stage 2 of Kakadu. The land claim was partially successful, and in 1986 three areas of the eastern part of stage 2 were granted to the Jabiluka Aboriginal Lands Trust. A lease between the land trust and the Director of National Parks was signed in March 1991. At the time of preparing this plan the rest of stage 2, except the commercial lease near the South Alligator River, was subject to repeat land claims under the land rights act.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 1987, a land claim was lodged for the land in the former Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases that were to be included in stage 3 of Kakadu. The other areas to be included in stage 3, the areas known as the Gimbat Resumption and the Waterfall Creek Reserve—formerly known as UDP Falls; UDP standing for Uranium Development Project—were later added to this land claim. Three stages of Kakadu National Park were declared progressively on 12 June 1987, 22 November 1989 and 24 June 1991.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kakadu National Park has been in Mungguy land, which is of immense cultural and economic importance to its traditional owners. A further long-overdue measure of justice is finally being provided to these owners by this bill. The bill will resolve four land claims: Ngombur; Alligator Rivers Area III—Gimbat and Goodparla; the Kakadu, Jim Jim area; and the Kakadu region repeat claim. Some of these claims date back to 1978. This means that after some 30 years, from when the first stage of Kakadu National Park was declared on 5 April 1979, the whole of the park will finally become Aboriginal land and be jointly managed as originally envisaged. The park is a World Heritage area under the World Heritage Convention, recognised as part of Australia's national heritage, and includes wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar convention.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Anthony Lagoon Station, NT portion 5010, there is an amendment before us to include land on Anthony Lagoon station, and Labor supports this amendment. This settles longstanding claims over stock routes and bore reserves, which are unalienated crown land, by the recognition of an area of Aboriginal land for a community living area within the boundaries of the pastoral lease. It provides secure and certain tenure for traditional owners over a relatively small portion of their traditional country. It is by agreement with the pastoralists of the Northern Territory government. I note the claim was lodged by Michael Dodson, a senior legal advisor to the Northern Land Council at the time—some relation of mine, I think.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Urapunga township was created in 1885. Historically, lots in the town remained unsold and the town failed to develop. Surrounding areas have been recognised as Aboriginal land. The Yutpundji-Djindiwirritj Aboriginal Lands Trust was granted a title to NT portion 2632 following a report in 1982 by the then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Toohey. The town was subject to a native title determination, in Ngalakan People v Northern Territory, on 5 June 2001. In the context of an appeal, an ILUA—an agreement—was reached in 2005 with the Northern Territory government to provide land within the town to become Aboriginal land. In exchange, security of tenure was provided to a local business.</span>

I pay respect to those who have been in this fight and I recognise them as the owners of their own lands. The decision by Justice John Griffith in the special on-country hearing to recognise the native title rights of the Mirarr people is long awaited and well deserved. I also congratulate the Gundjheimi Aboriginal Corporation on their hard work in leading the fight for recognition and ensuring Jabiru is returned to the rightful owners.

That is because they are both distinguished, high-performing members of the Liberal team. In case it escaped Senator Carr's notice, it was a state election. In Victoria on the weekend we had a state election. We wish our team had done better, but the result is as it is and we respect the verdict of the Victorian people in that state election. As I have also observed today, of course the events of a few months ago at the federal level didn't help, but certainly all the feedback that we had from our supporters at polling booths was that this was, predominantly, a state election fought on state issues. That doesn't mean to say that as a government at the federal level we won't listen carefully. Of course we will listen very carefully to what people in Victoria have told us and we'll continue to refine the way that we move forward. That's something that we have a responsibility to do. </span>

That is why, having inherited a weakening economy from Labor, having inherited rising unemployment from Labor, having inherited a rapidly deteriorating budget position from Labor, what we have done over the last five years is work hard to ensure that Australians today and into the future have the best possible opportunity to get ahead on the back of a stronger economy—more jobs—and indeed to get the budget back into a stronger and improving position into the future. We have a responsibility. We're very conscious of the responsibility we have to the Australian people to ensure that our agenda can continue to be implemented beyond the next election, federally, and we will do everything we can to learn the lessons at the federal level from the Victorian state election.</span>

We know that Senator Carr, who has a background of liking socialist, dictatorial, authoritarian systems, might want to be in charge of a system with thought police, where everybody is prevented from expressing a view. On our side of parliament, it's self-evident that, after an election in a state like the great state of Victoria on the weekend, there'll be a conversation inside our party. It's a conversation where people are entitled to express their view. The conversation that takes place will help us to be an even stronger and better government than we otherwise would be. The Australian people very much need us to win the next election because Mr Shorten, as Prime Minister, would make Australia weaker and Australians poorer.</span>

It's a matter of public record that leadership transitions are not popular, and they're difficult. That was a difficult week, and it was a difficult issue for the government. That's not something we've shied away from. Our focus is on doing the best job we can to promote the best interests of the Australian people. Labor goes to the next election promising to increase taxes by $200 billion, which will make Australia weaker and Australians poorer. Our focus will be on helping Australians get ahead by helping to ensure that the businesses that employ them have the best possible opportunity to be successful into the future.</span>

Over the past week, both the International Monetary Fund and the OECD have released important fresh assessments of the Australian economy and the economic growth outlook for Australia. Both those independent international organisations gave a ringing endorsement of the strength of the Australian economy and our economic growth outlook. The International Monetary Fund pointed out that our economy's strong growth momentum would continue and that private consumption growth would remain buoyant, supported by strong employment gains. The OECD pointed to a robust outlook for the Australian economy, noting that 'rising employment is boosting incomes and consumption' and 'growth of wages will rise gradually while the unemployment rate will edge lower'. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth remembering what the IMF was saying about the Australian economy back in 2013, when Labor was in office. Back then, the IMF was warning about the prospect of below-trend growth. The IMF said then that there was a real likelihood that demand for labour would fall, that wages and employment growth would slow, that consumption growth would decline and that government finances would weaken. That is exactly what we found when we came into government in September 2013. Labor left behind a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. We had to fix Labor's fiscal and economic mess. What we have delivered through our plan for a stronger economy and more jobs and to repair the budget is what the IMF and the OECD today reflect on as a stronger economy, more jobs and a stronger and better economic growth outlook: 3.4 per cent growth—twice as fast as the French economy, nearly three times as fast as the UK economy and well above the OECD average of 2.5 per cent. That does not happen by accident; it's happened because we turned the situation left by— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Changing direction and going back to Labor's discredited economic and fiscal policies of the past would make Australia weaker and would make Australians poorer; $200 billion in higher taxes, which is what Labor has announced so far, would lead to less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs and higher unemployment and, as a result of higher unemployment, lower wages and ultimately less government revenue to fund the important services provided by government: the social safety net, access to quality health care, funding for schools—you name it. Under Labor's discredited approach of the past, we inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. That was when Mr Shorten was a senior cabinet minister in that government and Mr Bowen was the shadow Treasurer. Not even Paul Keating has confidence in Labor's approach these days, and I'll get to that in the next supplementary. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Don't take my word for it. We know that even Labor's greatest heroes are alarmed by the policy direction of Mr Shorten.

Given we had an election on the weekend in the great state of Victoria, as is indicated in the question the Prime Minister met with his Victorian colleagues. I think it's a matter of public record who his Victorian colleagues are. I don't subscribe to the description that Senator Kitching has attached to it. It was a meeting very much in the context of our efforts at all times to be the best government we can be to deliver the best possible outcomes for the Australian people.</span>

The economic growth outlook is better. Employment growth is much stronger, and indeed our budget is in a stronger—and improving—position now. That of course is helping us ensure that we can fund all of the important services Australians expect their government to provide in a sustainable fashion.</span>

It was a usual meeting that the Prime Minister has from time to time. In the context of the election on the weekend, the Prime Minister meets with colleagues on a state-by-state basis as appropriate, and that is an important part of the job he does as the leader of our team nationally. It was a very constructive meeting. It was a meeting focused on making sure that we deliver the best possible outcomes for the Australian people right across Australia and that we put ourselves in the best possible position to win the next election, because that is in the national interest; it is in the interests of families around Australia wanting to get ahead, who would be harmed by the anti-business, high-taxing, politics-of-envy, socialist agenda prosecuted by Mr Shorten.</span>

Let me tell you something. When Labor lost government in 2013, a lot of Australians were not able to find a job. In fact, the number of Australians not able to find a job was on the up—and up and up. But today, after five years of Liberal-National government, we are able to point to more than 1.1 million new jobs having been created—including 350,000 new jobs in 2017-18, which was 150,000 more new jobs than we had anticipated when we delivered the 2017-18 budget. That, of course, has helped to drive a significantly improved budget performance, with an improvement in the budget bottom line to the tune of about $19.3 billion because 150,000 more Australians paid personal income tax and 150,000 more Australians didn't pay the same level of welfare they otherwise would have. This is the virtuous economic cycle that we— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I particularly want to congratulate Papua New Guinea on their successful hosting of the APEC summit, which saw hundreds of meetings, and thousands of visitors, in Port Moresby particularly, over the last year. They have done an outstanding job. I also welcome the release of Prime Minister O'Neill's chair's statement. APEC was a timely opportunity to engage with regional counterparts and to encourage closer economic integration, free trade and investment, and sustainable and inclusive growth.</span>

We are strongly committed to working closely with our Pacific neighbours to build a prosperous and resilient region. As the Prime Minister announced recently, the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific will significantly boost economic development opportunities and help to address major infrastructure financing gaps facing our regional partners. We will be expanding our diplomatic presence to every Pacific Island Forum country, with new posts in the Cook Islands, Niue, French Polynesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands.</span>

In fact, I have already met with church leaders to share views on how they could work with Pacific churches further to provide community support and services. These are real demonstrations of our government's commitment to working with our partners across the Indo-Pacific to build a region that is more prosperous, more stable and more secure.</span>

And as part of these plans we will now also establish an Office of the Pacific to enhance whole-of-government coordination as we deliver on our commitments to strengthen that engagement across the region. The office will bring together officials not just from DFAT, where it will be located, but also from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Defence, the Department of Home Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department to work together to implement these new initiatives.</span>

At the ASEAN Australia meeting in the margins of the East Asia Summit in Singapore earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced that Australia will help to develop a new South-East Asia economic governance and infrastructure initiative, which is going to be able to provide countries with technical advice on taxation, competition policy and debt management. It will also support infrastructure project selection and help governments to mobilise finance. At the summit, we also committed to sharing Australian water management expertise with countries on the Mekong and strengthening our engagement on maritime security issues—also matters of great concern. We have signed a trilateral infrastructure MOU with Japan and the United States, under which we'll work together to mobilise private capital to help address the region's significant infrastructure needs. This will enable greater opportunities for Australian business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, almost nine years ago, the Greens introduced the first bill to establish a broad based independent anticorruption body. We've had legislation before the last three parliaments, not to mention a number of motions put before the Senate. In January this year, the Labor Party reversed their opposition. We welcomed that. They now support our position for an anticorruption watchdog. Indeed, all of the members of the crossbench in the House support an anticorruption watchdog. Just today, the government supported Senator Waters's motion in the House for the establishment of an anticorruption watchdog. So my question to you, Minister, is: will you now legislate for a broad based anticorruption authority in this term of parliament?</span>

We have a robust multifaceted approach to combatting corruption. But, having said that and as we have said for some time, we continue to consider and to assess what improvements can be made to further strengthen that system. But, with these sorts of suggestions, the devil is always in the detail. For example, on the bill that's been put forward by crossbenchers in the other place, our advice is that, if that were legislated in its current form, a journalist with the ABC or SBS, because these are taxpayer funded organisations, could find themselves compelled to answer questions, to reveal sources and, indeed, to release legal advice that they have obtained in the context of various stories that they might run from time to time. I suspect that across this chamber there would be broad consensus that that would be an entirely undesirable situation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The broader point I'm making here is that I think we all agree that there ought to be anticorruption arrangements in place that are as effective as possible. Australia has a very good track record internationally when it comes to anticorruption frameworks and measures. Indeed, we are recognised internationally as one of the least corrupt jurisdictions in the world. But there's also room for improvement. The initiatives that you might want to pursue to improve the current framework ought to actually genuinely make things better rather than lead to all sorts of undesirable and unintended consequences. That is the process that needs to be undertaken always by the parliament: to carefully consider whether proposals that are on the table actually would make things better rather than make things worse.</span>

I would just point out that Labor announced support for a national integrity commission about 12 months ago, saying at the time that they had gone through 12 months of consultation, yet to date we haven't seen a single proposal on the table anywhere. We haven't seen any proposed legislation from the Labor Party at all. All we get from the Labor Party is the occasional stunt in pursuit of the occasional headline; there's actually no substance. In fact, all we've got from the Labor Party is one stunt after another, without any substance. These are very complex matters of the law, and it's very important that the strong anti-corruption arrangements that are in place now are not inadvertently weakened by insufficiently considered proposals that might come up from time to time. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Indeed, we dropped in ranking in the annual corruption index. Today we've seen 32 former judges sign an open letter for the establishment of an anti-corruption watchdog. Minister, can you tell us why these judges are wrong, why our ranking has slid and why you refuse to make a commitment for a national anti-corruption watchdog in this term of parliament?</span>

But of course I can't pre-empt processes that are yet to take place. I can't pre-empt what complications or what legal issues might need to be resolved through the consultative processes that are yet to take place. So, I'm not going to lock us into the sort of black-and-white position that Senator Di Natale is inviting me to lock ourselves into. What I can say is that this government has continued to do everything we can to ensure that our anti-corruption arrangements and the framework to fight corruption are as robust and as strong as possible.</span>

My colleagues have said nothing of the sort. Secondly, the question that Senator Collins tacked on at the end has been answered on many, many occasions. The truth is that, under our system of parliament, to be Prime Minister you have to have the confidence of a majority of the members in your party room, and the majority of members in our party room determined that Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg should be the leader and deputy leader of our party. If you look at the record, that is what I said in this chamber in the question time after those events.</span>

Unfortunately, Senator Hanson, I am going to have to disagree with the proposition that you have put forward. Why? Because those of us on this side of the chamber, the Liberal-National government, are known for our very strong stance when it comes to border security and ensuring that Australians are safe. What we have announced recently builds on the suite of measures that we have progressively put in place since we were elected to office in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first instance, Senator Hanson, you will be aware that, when we came to office in 2013, we had to clean up the Labor-Greens mess. Labor and the Greens had outsourced our borders to the people smugglers. As a result, in excess of 50,000 people had come to our shores illegally. We, of course, had the issue of children in detention. We, of course, had the issue of detention centre after detention centre being opened. Progressively, we were able to put in policies to restore the integrity back to our borders and to ensure that, as a sovereign government, we decide who comes to Australia and the terms upon which they come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is now, as you know, taking further steps to modernise and strengthen our counterterrorism legislation. The purpose of the amendments that we have announced is twofold: firstly, to keep Australians safe from evolving terrorist threats—and, Senator Hanson, you would be aware that the terrorist threats continue to evolve—and, secondly, to uphold the integrity of Australian citizenship and the privileges that attach to it. As has been outlined by the minister for border protection and the Prime Minister, we will be amending the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 so that a dual national convicted of a terrorist offence in Australia would be eligible to lose their Australian citizenship, irrespective of any custodial sentence. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We believe that, at all times, you must put Australians and Australia first. We believe that the No. 1 priority of a government is to be the security of its borders and the safety of Australians.

We take very, very seriously our responsibility to protect the Australian community from the risk of harm posed by noncitizens who engage in criminal activity or other behaviours of concern. Again, you would note that, in relation to the announcement that has been made of late, it is in relation to steps to modernise and strengthen counterterrorism legislation. I have to say that the Minister for Home Affairs, and, in fact, the Prime Minister, in his former role, have been absolutely outstanding in terms of ensuring that our border security and keeping Australians safe are absolute priorities for this government, and we will never shy away from that.</span>

You would be aware that, at the end of the last sitting week—in fact, on the Thursday night—the 25th Australian Training Awards were held at the International Convention Centre in Sydney, and this was all about recognising the excellence and professionalism in vocational education and training in Australia. I was delighted to attend and to meet with hundreds and hundreds of people who are dedicated to ensuring that the vocational education and training sector in Australia is the best it can be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government recognises that vocational education and training is an important pathway. It is an important pathway that has served the Australian community, individuals, businesses and our economy well for the better part of a century. In fact, it is our highly skilled workforce in Australia that sets us apart from other countries and ensures that we are a place of unrivalled economic growth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the training awards, there were a number of awards handed out. In fact, there were 18 handed out on the night. The Apprentice of the Year was a gentleman by the name of Mr Michael Edwards, and he was from Wagga Wagga. Many of the senators in this place will be pleased to know that Mr Edwards was a mature-age person. He was a motor mechanic for 15 years before his bosses at Snowy Hydro said to him, 'We would like you to take on another trade and become an electrician.' As Mr Edwards said, this was a great decision for both parties, both for the employer and for him in particular, because the skills that he now has as a mature-age person are in such high demand. We also had a young lady from Perth by the name of Caitlin Whittle. She won the Australian School-based Apprentice of the Year. I wish all of the winners on the night my very best.</span>

Australia's vocational and education training system is a world-class system. It not only serves millions of Australians, providing them with valuable qualifications; it also contributed $5.2 billion of export income to the Australian economy just last year. But, disappointingly—and because of VET FEE-HELP instituted by those on the other side—all too often these outstanding achievements are undermined by the VET FEE-HELP system, which those on the other side implemented, that allowed dodgy providers to step in and basically destroy vocational education and training within Australia. We have progressively ensured that we have put the integrity back into the system by cleaning up Labor's mess.</span>

We invest in it because we know that vocational education and training is vital to our economic success. We established the Skilling Australians Fund, and I'm pleased to say that this has been signed up to by all states except, unfortunately, the state of Victoria and the state of Queensland. The other states that have signed up to it will now have the opportunity to create tens of thousands of new apprenticeship places. We're also investing an additional $1.2 billion on skills programs as a government, and we also provide $1.5 billion to the states and territories for skills through the National Skills and Workforce Development Specific Purpose Payment. We also recently announced a $60 million wage subsidy pilot for apprentices in rural and regional Australia.</span>

I've got to say that I'm touched by how concerned the Labor senators appear to be about the welfare of the Victorian Liberal Party. It's good to see that a Labor senator from Tasmania is out here expressing her concern about the future successes of the Liberal Party in Victoria. Let me just say, as I said in response to a number of questions earlier, that of course we always very carefully consider the results of elections around Australia, including and in particular the election on the weekend in the great state of Victoria. Of course we will carefully consider the lessons learned. We are very conscious of our responsibility to the Australian people to win the next election to continue to implement our plan for a stronger economy and more jobs, which will help ensure that families around Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, because we understand that the alternative is the disastrous, recklessly high-taxing, antibusiness, politics of envy, socialist agenda of Mr Shorten, which would make all Australians poorer, make Australia weaker and make it harder for Australian families to get ahead. We take our responsibility to be competitive at the next federal election very seriously indeed. Of course we will consider very carefully what the Victorian people told us on the weekend and we will make judgements accordingly. </span>

She wouldn't want to ask me about the Tasmanian Liberal Party, because of course at the last election that the Tasmanian Liberal Party competed with the Tasmanian Labor Party—I'm just trying to remember what happened—that's right, the Hodgman government was returned. I think the Australian people can see what is happening here. We've got a Labor Party that is getting increasingly cocky. We've got a Labor Party that believes they've already won the next election. I would just gently remind you of 2001. We will do everything we can to be in the strongest possible position to win the next election. Talking about people taking views in relation to political parties, we know that Paul Keating has no confidence in Mr Shorten, because he is quoted as saying that Labor has lost the ability to speak aspirationally to people and to fashion policies to meet those aspirations. Of course that is absolutely right.</span>

Today our economy is stronger, our economic growth outlook is better, employment growth is much better, unemployment is well below where it was anticipated it would be, wages growth has started to pick up and the budget is in a stronger and improving position. It is no wonder that Labor had to give this question to a senator from Tasmania, because they had run out of senators from Victoria to give questions to. Where is Senator Marshall talking about unity and cohesiveness inside political parties? </span>

There was some good news last week about job creation in Queensland. We on this side of the chamber support the creation of jobs—we support those who want to work in their life to provide for their family—and new investments and new projects help to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Queensland Coordinator-General approved a new coalmine in North Queensland, the Macmines China Stone project, a $6.7 billion investment that would create 3,800 jobs in construction and 3,300 jobs in operation. It would help boost the Queensland economy by $1½ billion a year when it's in operation, and, very importantly, it would generate almost $190 million a year in royalties for the Queensland government, helping to fund better schools, better hospitals and better public services right throughout Queensland, in particular in North Queensland. This is a very important project, given that we need jobs in North Queensland right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week as well there was some not-so-good news released for North Queensland. That confirmed that in Townsville the unemployment rate has averaged 8.9 per cent over the past 12 months. As Senator Cormann was outlining earlier, there's been a buoyant job market around the country, with more than 300,000 jobs created in the last 12 months, but there are still pockets of North Queensland that are struggling, and they need economic fill-ups like these projects. That's why we support them—because investments like this are going to create jobs; they're going to create opportunity; and they are going to have a wider economic impact than just the mine itself, because this mine is right next-door to the Adani Carmichael mine. If we have multiple mines starting up, that will support more infrastructure, more development and more economic activity in the region as well, which will help communities right through North Queensland. It's great news for North Queensland, great news for Queensland and great news for the whole of Australia.</span>

In their Climate Change Action Plan, the Labor Party say they support the 'orderly transition' away from the coal-fired-power industry. Indeed, in the Labor Party's policy platform—this is a direct quote—they say:</span>

To your question, Senator Stoker, through you, Mr President, what really has been lacking are announcements on this development. Normally, a $6.7 billion project being approved by the Queensland government Coordinator-General would receive a level of support from the Queensland government. You'd think they'd be happy to promote the fact that Queensland's a state that's attracting investment and promoting this factor. There has not been boo from the Queensland government. They're ashamed of the coal industry; they're ashamed of standing next to coal workers. If you're working in the coal industry in this country or you know someone who's working in the coal industry, don't trust your job with the Australian Labor Party and don't trust your job with Mr Bill Shorten, because they cannot be trusted, they do not support the industry and, indeed, they're looking to shut it all down.</span>

                  </a>  Thanks, President. The China Stone mine is now moving ahead. The Adani mine would suck 12½ billion litres of water from the Suttor River and up to six gigalitres of groundwater in a region already crippled by drought. The China Stone mine is expected to need about as much water, so, if both mines were to proceed, it would double the take of surface and groundwater. If both mines proceeded, they would use twice as much as all other users of the Suttor River combined. This region is crippled by drought. Fifty-eight per cent of Queensland is crippled by drought. Will the minister finally stand up for our environment and our precious water and reject this new water-hungry mega thermal coalmine?</span>

I do, however, acknowledge that Senator Waters indicated that parts of Queensland, parts of New South Wales, parts of Australia are doing it tough from drought conditions at present. Parts of Australia are doing it tough in terms of not experiencing or getting the benefits of the economic growth that Australia overall is enjoying. That, of course, is one of the reasons why the coalition government firmly welcomes proposals that create investment in jobs and opportunities in regional Australia. We want to see regional Australia get the benefits of investments across a whole range of different industries.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />In relation to the China Stone coalmine project that my colleague Senator Canavan was just discussing, it is correct that a proposal for this mine, adjacent to another proposal for the Carmichael coalmine, has been put forward. The mine is undergoing a comprehensive assessment for its impacts on listed threatened species and water resources, which I know were a feature of Senator Waters' question, as is required by the EPBC Act. The Queensland Coordinator-General released their evaluation report on the environmental impact statement on 22 November 2018. The Coordinator-General's report will also be used as an approval decision under the EPBC Act, under the standard accredited assessment processes. The Department of the Environment and Energy is now reviewing the evaluation report to prepare a recommendation on whether or not approval for the proposal should also be granted under the EPBC Act. This decision is due on 29 January and will, of course, receive all of the usual thorough expert advice to inform its decision-making. Our government makes sure that we apply strict and robust environmental conditions, but we also work to ensure that projects can be facilitated wherever possible to ensure that communities get the job and investment opportunities they deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I begin by just making clear that due acknowledgment of the Victorian election result has to be given to Premier Daniel Andrews, the state parliamentary Labor Party and the Victorian branch of the ALP. Having said that, I think those in this chamber would be aware of my involvement in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. I can say with some certainty that, since August and the removal of the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, there's been no doubt that the Liberal vote has collapsed in that state. We only have to look at the published polling in that regard, because back in August the published polling in regard to the differences between the parties was roughly fifty-fifty, and ever since that time the gap between the political parties has simply grown wider and wider. This is an emphatic victory, of course, for the Andrews Labor government because of the policy directions that government has followed, but it also is a complete rejection of the policy positions that were taken by the Liberal opposition in Victoria, which reflected so clearly the positions that had been taken in Canberra in regard to race baiting, division, and extraordinary social and moral conservatism that's reflected a view of society which is more reminiscent of the 1950s than of 21st century Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A social democratic government, as we see in Victoria, is able to have a very strong record of getting things done, predicated on the assumption that if you've got massive growth in the population—and Victoria is growing probably at the fastest rate anywhere in the Commonwealth, and Melbourne is growing to be the largest city in the Commonwealth and may well be one of the fastest growing cities in the world—then the people of that state, Victoria, are looking to government to do its job and to ensure that the services that are provided in education, health and infrastructure are able to meet the challenges. So it's no good talking about how we're going to restrict the rights of people to live in Victoria by saying we're going to cut immigration or we're going to restrict people's rights as to where they live, because that doesn't change the fundamentals in terms of what people are looking for. The fact that there has been neglect in recent years in terms of spending by governments, planning and providing the necessary services doesn't change the fact that now people are looking towards government to make sure that they work hand in hand to secure the future prosperity of the state, and that's exactly what the Labor government and the Labor Party has argued. It has been able to demonstrate to the people that there is, in fact, a really clear vision of the direction the state should be going in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast couldn't be sharper. The division in terms of the opportunities that have been presented and then missed—totally missed—by the Liberal Party in Victoria is only too clear for all those to see. There are people like Michael Sukkar, Minister Hunt, who was the running mate for Mr Dutton, Alan Tudge—and, of course, Senator Fifield. Who could forget that infamous press conference out in the courtyard here, where out of sheer panic, they chose to move towards a much more conservative view of the way in which the Liberal Party should operate. That was completely rejected by the people of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the cheer squad within the Murdoch press has been urging this government to take forward a position even more to the right than has actually been adopted. The main complaint is that this government is not right wing enough. What we have seen is that the once great Liberal Party has now degenerated into a group of warring ideological sects driven by ambition and not committed to any deep-seated ideological position in terms of the advancement of a progressive agenda in this country. As a consequence you have got areas across the eastern belt of Melbourne—the so-called Bible Belt of Melbourne—rejecting the Liberal Party so comprehensively that you can't help but be surprised at the extent to which the Liberal Party is so out of touch. Of course, it's the same Liberal Party driven by the same groups of people in this city at the national level, whereby the people in suburbs such as Box Hill and Glen Waverley, from Frankston through to Carrum, to Mordialloc and Bentleigh—thoroughly middle-class communities—are rejecting the Liberal Party. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  What extraordinary irony we have on display today from the Labor Party. There were four questions here about the Victorian state election. Four questions! There were four questions about quotes, about interviews, about articles. Not one question today was about the economy. Not one question was about health, education, hospitals, schools, drought relief, trade, tax reform, welfare reform. You accused us of not listening, and yet did you hear yourselves today? Did you hear yourselves banging on about the inconsequential? Clearly Labor senators were penned and counted in the Senate lobby and given a series of questions with no objective other than to unnecessarily poke the bear. You regurgitated the same self-indulgent, ignorant, combative and entirely unconstructive drivel. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the irony of the last weekend was that Daniel Andrews won an election on the basis that he is building things in Victoria, but he is building things with $75 billion worth of infrastructure investment from this coalition government. Daniel Andrews was lauding the fact that 350,000 jobs had been created in Victoria under his watch. Well, 1.2 million jobs have been created under the watch of this coalition government. Daniel Andrews has ridden on our coat-tails. Daniel Andrews was lauding his strong economy in Victoria—a strong economy that is riding on the coat-tails of 3.4 per cent economic growth that was delivered by this coalition government. Five free trade agreements have supported it. Three AAA credit ratings have been reaffirmed. Daniel Andrews's strong economy is the federal government's strong economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Daniel Andrews has been riding on strong housing prices, but just wait until the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, gets his hands on those housing prices. Just wait until Mr Shorten gets an opportunity to introduce negative gearing changes and capital gains tax changes. Let's see how pleased the Victorian voters are when they watch the prices of their properties plummet. Let's see how pleased the Victorian voters are—already being the highest taxing state in the land—when there are $200 billion worth of new taxes introduced by the opposition leader, Mr Shorten. Let's see how happy Victorian voters are when they see debt set to double as a percentage of GSP. They have already announced that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, yes, an emphatic victory for Victorian Labor, but you will be a profound disappointment. Yes, this is a test of character. A test of character is grace in defeat. I pay tribute to my colleagues and my friends that are no longer members of the Victorian state parliament. I won't mention them by name. There are many of them. I will mention Robert Clark, who, as the member for Box Hill, had a career of over 30 years in state parliament and has served his party extraordinarily well. I am very proud of the candidates that we ran at this state election and very proud of the work that they put in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would like to say today is that not only is there grace in defeat but also that the best test of character is humility in victory—and you have not shown that today. The call from Victoria, the call from the electorate, was to listen. Your behaviour today proves that you are unable to listen to them, to stop talking about yourselves and to get on with the job. We will listen; we will act. I want to tell Labor today: don't get too comfortable and don't get too smug. The message to Mr Shorten should be to remind him that he remains profoundly unpopular, and that endless lies in campaigning will only take you so far. My message to Victorian Labor and to those opposite me in the chamber, with your unctuous smiles today, is: don't measure for the curtains just yet; this race is no way near won.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann today. Of course, Senator Cormann not only has former Prime Minister Turnbull's blood on his hands; he now also has Matthew Guy's as well. He's like the boy who played with matches, and he's burnt the whole Liberal house down. A smouldering ruin is left in what was once the jewel in the Liberal crown—104 Exhibition Street is being sold; a decent Liberal leader in Victoria is now gone. I know Matthew Guy. He is a decent and talented person, but his campaign was hijacked by federal errorists. These are the same bunglers who declared Melbourne, a very safe and very liveable city, to be unsafe at night, even though our nightlife is the envy of many—perhaps especially those in Sydney—and it has very little trouble. Even on long dark winter nights in Melbourne, hundreds of thousands of people come into the city on weekend nights to watch the AFL, to dine in some of the best restaurants in the world and to have a nightcap in some of our laneway bars, and, in summer, hundreds of thousands of people are out for the cricket, the tennis and the myriad of other events that are run in Melbourne and to enjoy the beauty of the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The errorists in the federal Liberal Party, the bungling federal Liberals who came to town, wanted to create fear, and we could hear it in Senator Cormann's responses today. They wanted to create economic fear, social fear and racial fear. In Victoria, they wanted to divide Victorian against Victorian. Bungling federal Liberals came to town and they demanded Victorian Liberals be more extreme on every issue. But don't take my word for it; let's go to the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and Chip Le Grand's article today. Underneath the headline 'Puffer-jacket squad delivers pained message', it said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Along the beaches of Sandringham, beneath the lush, elm-tree canopies of Hawthorn, from dress-circle addresses in Brighton, they marched into polling booths to deliver a message that will send political shockwaves from Melbourne to Canberra. The Liberal Party, their Liberal Party, no longer spoke to them. In Daniel Andrews, they saw a Premier promising to deliver more of the essential services and infrastructure that a fast-growing city needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are many quotes from Liberal voters and an expose of some of the seats where some of the candidates fielded by Labor nearly won. That included Brighton, where a very young candidate, a 19-year-old still on his drivers permit, nearly won against someone who should have had no contest in that seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, what did Daniel Andrews and Labor talk about? They talked about schools and hospitals. They talked about TAFE colleges. They talked about kindergartens and child care. They talked about trains and trams. They talked about how Labor has removed 29 level crossings in four years. And I want to pay tribute to a friend of mine, Fiona Richardson, who, as many here know, died of breast cancer. When she was shadow public transport minister it was her policy idea to remove those level crossings. And those policy ideas, the policy development that goes on in the Labor Party—as opposed to the thought bubbles to which we have all been subject to from the Liberal Party recently—is what we do in the Labor Party. Daniel Andrews and the Labor team set out concrete, practical plans to meet the needs of a rapidly-growing Victoria. They talked about inclusion and equality, not exclusion and division.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann himself might not be able to draw any lessons from Saturday in Victoria, but we have. I noticed that some of the contributions from the other side have talked about smugness et cetera—we're not smug; we know this is going to be a tough campaign—and then there's talk that we 'don't understand'. But you can see from the campaign that the Labor Party ran and what we have done, and from the fact that the Premier is back at work at 1 Treasury Place today, that we do listen, we do take action and we do care about what people think. And we know that if you offer voters a program of moderate, sensible, practical reforms, reforms that address problems and help Australians, they will respond positively. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I too rise to take note of questions to Senator Cormann today. As Senator Cormann said, we will, as a party, consider what happened on the weekend in Victoria—as every political party should. But, just to give those on the other side a little civics lesson, it is important to remember that Australia is a federation. We are a federation of states and a Commonwealth, and there are state elections that are fought on state issues and there are federal elections that are fought on federal issues. I'm sure Senator Watt knows very well that the people of Queensland consider very carefully the policies of Queensland state governments when considering how they vote at their state elections—as do the citizens of Western Australia. I'm sure we wouldn't want to do any disservice to the people of Queensland to say that they are not considering the ramifications at a state level of electing a state government, so we have to take that as the pre-eminent factor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we have heard today, as Senator Hume so eloquently pointed out, is Labor yet again asking the 'inside the beltway' questions, the political questions—not focused on policy, not focused on the needs of the Australian people, but focused only on a cheap political victory, a cheap political stunt targeting this government. We are a government that's getting on with the job of delivering a stronger economy for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the September quarter, we saw the economy growing at 3.4 per cent, surpassing pretty much all market expectations of economic growth—27 years of consecutive economic growth. I know we've all heard it a lot, but that's no accident. It comes from the hard work of a number of governments—and, particularly, the Howard-Costello government. But the current Liberal-National government has also added to that—the highest growth rate in the economy since 2012, which was of course the height of the mining boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong economy, as I have said before, is not just about a number in the budget papers; it's about delivering jobs. It's about delivering jobs on the ground. This government came to office promising to deliver a million jobs over five years and it has delivered those jobs. Those jobs changed the life of real Australians. They changed the life of real people, giving them opportunities and hope for the future. This is what governments should do: get on with the job of doing what is right for the Australian people, what is right for the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 412,000 jobs created in 2017 alone—the most jobs ever created in a calendar year on record; the unemployment rate, declining to 5.3 per cent—the lowest level since 2012 and well below the level we inherited from Labor in September 2013; participation rates at 65 per cent—a record level; more women participating in work; more seniors and more young people finding employment; and youth unemployment at its lowest level in over six years. Personally, I think this is one of the key statistics in any set of ABS figures and any set of budget papers, because getting younger people into work as early as possible sets them on a pathway for a successful life. That is what we should all be trying to achieve in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite love to play politics. They love to do political stunts, but what we need is a government that is getting on with the job and delivering for Australians out there in the community—building those small and family built businesses that allow people to get the jobs that they need when they're young and to have successful and full lives. Obviously, there are so many other things that we could talk about in terms of the positive record of this government. From my home state's point of view, the GST reforms obviously were an absolutely fundamental change to our federal structure that were long known to be needed. Those opposite said they were politically impossible, yet this government managed to see them through this place in our last sitting. So, as I've said, we are getting on with the job; we are delivering for the Australian people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I also rise to take note of the answers from the Minister representing the Prime Minister to questions on the Victorian election results. From the answers provided by the minister earlier today, you would believe that the election result in Victoria was a fair dinkum, dinky-di, anomaly and that the sole influences on the results were local; that somehow the Victorian people were out of touch with the rest of Australia, and everything is actually quite ridgy-didge. Even Senator Hume's speaking notes seem to have changed in the last few days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, full credit, of course, must go to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and his team. Premier Andrews ran a strong campaign, backing up a strong record in government, and has been rightly rewarded with a second term. The voters in Victoria, like voters everywhere else, know when they've got a good government and can see through the rhetoric and bluster coming from the other side, and vote accordingly. But to pretend, as some federal Liberals have been doing, that this result has no federal implications suggests that those opposite have learnt nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This result was a massive repudiation of today's Liberal Party—of politics that seeks to divide Australians with fear campaigns rather than focusing on the needs of the community. This wasn't the first time that voters have sent this message. We saw it in the repudiation of the Liberals in the Super Saturday by-elections. We saw it in the New South Wales Wagga Wagga by-election. We saw it in Wentworth just a few weeks ago after the Liberals had knifed Malcolm Turnbull. The voters don't want cuts, chaos and division; they want better schools, better hospitals and investment in renewables—all issues on which the contrast between the Morrison government and the Labor Party is, at all levels, there for all to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is possible that the result on the weekend was a consequence of a sustained, deliberate campaign, as reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shovel</span>. I can't be certain that this is accurate, but <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shovel</span> reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Labor is to blame for the Coalition’s abysmal showing in the 2018 Victorian State Elections, warning voters that Labor may also influence the outcome of the upcoming federal poll.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shovel</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Morrison said it was clear who was responsible for recent events. "What you've seen over the weekend – this truly terrible result – is the result of a sustained campaign by the Labor Party. Voters shouldn't forget that," Morrison said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"If you've woken up this morning to find your local Liberal member out of a job – that's Labor's fault. If you're wondering why Matthew Guy will soon be stepping down as leader, you'll find the seeds of his undoing in Labor".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"This has been a sustained, deliberate campaign to defeat us. I think that's pretty clear".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that it was actually the result of a federal government that's as out of touch as the Victorian state opposition is. But it is clear that at a federal level we also need change and that there's a clear difference between what is being offered by the current federal government and what Labor will offer in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Morrison government, Labor under Bill Shorten's leadership has policies focused on improving our schools and our education system. Labor will deliver an extra $14 billion for public schools over the next decade—the biggest investment in public schools in Australian history. Unlike the Liberals, Labor under Bill Shorten's leadership has policies focused on improving our hospitals and healthcare system. We will invest in every single public hospital across the country. Unlike the Liberals, Labor under Bill Shorten's leadership has policies focused on renewables and addressing climate change. Labor is committed to ending national energy policy uncertainty and achieving 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. Labor will supercharge the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by providing an additional $10 billion over five years from 2019-20, doubling its original capital investment. Labor will slash power bills, improve grid security and support new jobs in local industries by setting a new national target of one million household battery installations by 2025. Unlike the Liberals under the Morrison government, Labor under Bill Shorten's leadership is looking forward to fighting the next election on policies that address the needs of the Australian community. That's the lesson from the election on the weekend, and that's a lesson that those opposite are still not ready to hear.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Di Natale today relating to a national anti-corruption commission.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trust in politics is at an all-time low. People believe that our democracy is broken, that our democracy is working for big corporate interests, for vested interests, and not working for people. Our key priority in this place, across all sides, needs to be to restore faith in our public institutions to ensure that people have trust in the institutions that deliver politics in this country. That needs to start by getting money out of politics. That needs to start with strict caps on donations to political parties. Unless we get the money out and bring the people in, people have every right to not trust the decisions being made in our national parliament. We need strict donation caps, and we need prohibitions on donations from industries that benefit from the decisions being made by elected politicians. We need to close the revolving door between parliament and industry. We need laws that stop lobbying in a way that corrupts good government. We have to close that revolving door and we need to ensure that ministers who are responsible for making decisions over a particular policy area can't simply leave parliament and begin working in those industries over which they had parliamentary oversight. There have to be cooling-off periods. But front and centre needs to be the establishment of a national anticorruption watchdog. We have anti-corruption mechanisms right through our state parliaments and we have seen time and time again that those anti-corruption bodies have uncovered deeply disturbing behaviour across all sides, within the bureaucracy and among elected officials. There is nothing to say that Australian federal parliaments are immune from such temptations. When the potential rewards are high and the risk of getting caught is low, they are the preconditions for people to behave in a way that would be determined as corrupt. When you have nearly half a trillion dollars of public spending with very little oversight, where those anti-corruption mechanisms are vague or in some areas non-existent, they are the conditions under which corruption can thrive. That's why we saw only last week an open letter from 32 former judges rejecting the Attorney-General's contention that there's no persuasive evidence of corruption at a federal level. Indeed, they argued the precise opposite: that existing federal integrity agencies lack the necessary jurisdiction, the powers and the know-how to properly investigate the impartiality and bona fides of decisions made by and conduct of the federal government and public sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why there is now a consensus within the parliament that there has to be a national anticorruption watchdog. It is a policy the Greens have led with, beginning in 2010 with the introduction of legislation by Senator Bob Brown, then Christine Milne and me, and now Senator Waters leading the charge. We have all sides of politics acknowledging there is a problem. We have the Labor Party, earlier this year, reversing their opposition to a national anti-corruption watchdog. We have crossbench members in the House supporting the establishment of a national anti-corruption watchdog. It's only the Liberal Party who stand in its way. We have an opportunity to restore faith in our democracy, to ensure that our democracy works for people, not for vested interests, and to ensure that our democracy delivers for the community, not for big corporations. To do that we have to clamp down on those political donations. We have to stamp them out. We've got to close the revolving door between parliament and industry, with reforms to the way lobbyists operate. Most importantly, we need to introduce a national anti-corruption watchdog. We can't wait another moment. </span>

As the commissioner has repeatedly stated, each and every submission received by the commission has been read and taken into consideration by the commission in its work. The government has full confidence in the commissioner's statements. The commission has received close to 2,000 submissions in response to its interim report and its hearings into superannuation and insurance which were not covered by the interim report. The vast majority of these submissions have been published by the commission, including a large number of submissions from individuals. Submissions have not been published where people submitting the information have requested confidentiality or in other instances such as where they relate to individual disputes which give rise to confidentiality issues and other similar considerations.</span>

The government opposes this motion. It will open the door to ever-present parliamentary speculation and inquiry into taxpayer affairs. The ATO can penalise taxpayers that do not lodge a return. The government has increased the penalties on large multinationals that do not lodge a return up to $525,000.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we want to do this is because the litany of allegations, the fact-finding, the discussions, the public disclosure of the conduct within the Greens political party is so egregious. It contains the most grievous misdemeanours, including sexual harassment and allegations of rape. Those in the Greens pocket in this chamber are in abject denial about it. Just last week, when I was making points in this place, they were yelling abuse at me, saying it was a misuse of parliamentary privilege. Not two hours later they had to do the mea culpa and admit that there has been a disaster under Senator Di Natale's watch. Every Green in this chamber stands condemned for turning a blind eye to the malfeasance that is endemic in their party. Not only is there misogyny; there is misandry, there is heterophobia and there is clearly homophobia. There is a phobia and an ism for everyone in that place, because they will not take control of the disaster that is endemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the candidate for Batman was accused—I think there were 70 pages of bullying allegations. We know that a candidate accused of rape, who is named in this motion, was not removed from the Greens ballot paper until only days before the Victorian election. We know that former Senator Rhiannon, a person of integrity insofar as she wants to uphold some decency and normality within the Greens, as much as that can be said, was on the warpath about the types of behaviour that were ignored by the leadership within the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What concerns me in the debate and discussion about the conduct of a political party that have received in excess of $28 million of taxpayer funding, that stands in here and pretends to be pious and accuses everyone else of all sorts of misdemeanours, grievances and moral failures, is that they are the ones that have a history of covering up the abuse, the rampant sexism, the sexual molestation and the allegations of rape. We know about volunteers that have been dismissed by the Greens parliamentary party when they've raised complaints. We know they've been dismissed by the Greens organisational wing. This is a body that is completely bereft of any normality or any morality. They have an obligation to assist those who reach out and say, 'Something has taken place under your watch and you need to redress this.' Yet they refuse to do it. May I quote Senator Di Natale and Senator Hanson-Young: 'The standard you walk past is the standard that you accept.' Yet all of them have chosen to walk past the litany of allegations against the Greens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not confined to volunteers or to their candidates. We could continue to go on and on about the reports of what happens within the Greens parliamentary party and within their organisational wing. We know they've always been a secretive body that won't allow the media into their annual general meetings, and clearly the reason has been exposed: they don't like anyone gazing upon the entrails of what happens within the Greens movement. It is a movement that is rife with misogyny. It is a movement that is rife with misandry. It is a movement that picks one group of people over another every single time, and now they are caught in this conniption.</span>

Do we back the young lady who claims that she's been raped or molested by a Greens volunteer, or do we back the volunteer, the person who has allegedly perpetrated this crime? That is the question. Because the Greens have refused to deal with this, because they have refused to publicly address it except in spurious denials and by saying it's all been resolved by internal processes, we need this Senate to make a statement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I want to attach myself to the remarks of Senator Bernardi. In particular, I'm somewhat confounded by why the Australian Labor Party would deny formality on this, although I am not surprised. I remain confounded but not surprised, because it seems that now, when a motion that the Australian Labor Party or the Greens find disagreeable comes to the floor of the Senate, of course they deny formality or deny leave for us to make a comment about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this particular question, I agree with Senator Bernardi. This is a particularly serious issue. Here are the Greens movement, who are trying to introduce a federal ICAC, they say, to oversee corruption and misbehaviour in the political class, riddled with corruption, yet they refuse to attend to and deal with matters in their own house. They won't deal with matters in their own house.</span>

The first step in fixing the environment, though, is to break the silence. That's the first step.' They are very wise words. Let me see who said that. Oh, that would be Senator Sarah Hanson-Young in her recent publication <span style="font-style:italic;">En Garde</span>.</span>

                  </a>  I have. I've had to read it twice. It's not a very well-written piece, but I have read it thoroughly. 'No woman deserves to be harassed in her workplace.' Obviously that does not extend to you if you're a follower of the Australian Greens or a member of their party. Let me repeat it for effect: 'No woman deserves to be harassed in her workplace.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that we considered this motion was the fact that—while the Greens can stand and deny this—media reports suggest that efforts by the media to obtain comments from members of the Greens party, including the leadership, were unsuccessful. I note that Senator Hanson-Young and others on that side are particularly quiet today. They're particularly silent there. That's the longest I've seen them without their heads up. You need to get your tail up here and defend yourselves. The fact of the matter is that they were contacted by the media and they refused to make comment. The only reason, Senator Bernardi—through you, Madam Deputy President—that they responded to this was this motion. This motion drove them to have to make a decision last week, and they've finally done the right thing in the circumstances.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, we're here now fighting for a freedom of voice. This is about freedom of speech. We are entitled to bring matters of a serious nature to the floor of this Senate, and we have. I've done so. I've been the subject now of a constant denying of formality to motions. As I indicated the other week, we're now going to have a Ronald McDonald special on this. Each time I get denied, I'm going back with two and then, when you do two, I'll do four. This is trying to silence people who want to have a debate or want to have a decision taken, people who want to expose the position of people in relation to particular behaviour—in this case, within the Greens party—because it doesn't suit them. This is directed to you in the Labor Party. You can smile all you want. I'll be interested to see, if we get this up, where you guys vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A vote against this motion by the members of the Greens party—kick in, guys, kick in; I'm not used to standing here without you giving me a bollocking—will be interesting. For them to vote against this motion will be, as their behaviour demonstrates at the moment, a complete re-affirmation of the adoption and the cultivation of a culture within a political movement, an important movement, within this country, towards young, vulnerable women—and not one or two of them. This motion would never have got legs if it was one or two.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a systemic problem within the Greens. These people speak. They talk. They have a lot to say, but they never back it up with action. If you can't tidy up your own house, you can't come in here lecturing us on moral issues, issues around sexual assaults—until you fix matters at home.</span>

Yet, in this motion, we see a dozen allegations of Greens hypocrisy and sexism. In fact, it goes beyond the mere words of telling somebody to stop shagging men. We hear there are allegations, as outlined in this motion, of rape, of sexual assault and of endorsement of sexual assault—indeed, of advocacy of sexual assault. So I will exert my right to call the Greens hypocritical and sexist both in and out of the parliament, because not only is it true, but 'the standard you walk past is the standard you accept'.</span>

We are spending an inordinate amount of time on motions. The Senate has a lot of work to do that directly affects our constituents—work on introducing bills, on scrutiny, on debating legislation and on committee work. In some sense, what's happening here today simply illustrates why we need to deal with this. I get that motions are important, but we need to be very considered in the way in which we allocate time to this particular part of business. So Centre Alliance will be abstaining from the rest of the affairs related to this motion.</span>

                  </a>  The Liberal-National government is putting veterans and their families first by investing more than $11 billion each year in critical support. We've invested more than $275 million in the most significant reform of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in a century. We've invested over $70 million to make accessing mental health support easier. Now anyone with a single day of ADF service can access free mental health care as part of more than $200 million that has been invested each year on mental health support. A good transition is critical as ADF members return to civilian life, and central to this is funding meaningful employment. Defence data shows that the unemployment rate sits at eight per cent 13 months after transition, which is higher than average but nowhere near the 30 per cent often quoted. In the last budget, we provided over $8 million to support veterans' employment through the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program. We also recognise the important role of commemorating the service of our veterans' community. Could I ask that the question on part (b) be put separately?</span>

The commission has received over 3,200 phone calls and over 5,500 emails from members of the public, and 10,140 public submissions detailing consumers' experiences with financial service providers. Each and every one of these submissions has been read and considered by the royal commission. The government awaits the outcome of the royal commission and will take the necessary action to restore the public's confidence and trust in our financial system, and to ensure our financial system operates in the best interests of consumers.</span>

                    </a>  Labor will not be supporting Senator Anning's motion for another broad-ranging Senate select committee inquiry into financial services and banking. The most effective inquiry mechanism with the strongest, broad-ranging powers to compel documents and witnesses is actually the current banking royal commission. This royal commission would never have been called except for years of pressure from Shorten Labor. Labor would prefer to see the royal commission have its reporting date put back to allow more witnesses and victims of banking scandals to be able to appear before it. This should be the focus of the Senate and the parliament at this time.</span>

                  </a>  I'm happy to have a debate about morons and fools with the Greens anytime they like. But here we go again: a very serious motion, this time around issues to do with national security, is presented to the floor of this Senate and I'm denied the formality to allow people to place their vote. All I can assume is that, when you're denied formality, it's an indication that those denying it would have voted against the motion, as is true when I deny formality. It then follows that on such a significant issue of national security the Greens have now indicated that they don't want to be involved in a national discourse within this Senate, within this parliament, over such a serious issue. They don't want the question tested. This motion has been well thought through. It's a motion that is well structured and based in fact. It simply condemns the behaviour and the radicalisation of young Muslims in our country. We've seen recent events again. We know some of these institutions are hotbeds of radicalisation. This simply endeavours to lift awareness to address those issues. But this is about freedom of speech again. The denial of formality is about freedom of speech. You can't put—</span>

I did put you on notice that it's a special this week at Ronald McDonald's—two for one: if you try and silence me, I'll silence you twice, and we'll go until there are no motions debated on the floor of this Senate, if that's what you choose to do. There is absolutely no blink in me. This has been going on over a period of time, where we've tried to put significant, important issues to the floor—</span>

There wasn't much noise when we were talking about rape and sexual assault on members of their political party. Their heads were down. They were absolutely silent at that time because they condone it. Denial of formality here suggests to me that they are not against the idea of radicalisation of young Muslims affecting the national security of this country. There is no other conclusion to be drawn. You should go back to being silent. That's when you make your best contribution. </span>

What we say here and how we attach ourselves to a question and whether we support or don't support a particular issue is significant. Australia watches us. They do watch. I'm surprised at how many people don't have a hobby and spend their afternoon watching question time and now general notices of motion. </span>

This is a most serious motion. Normally if someone is going to deny formality for something there would be a rational reason for it. We're yet to hear that rational reason. But I have heard arguments from the Greens party that they weren't the ones that denied formality, even though I did distinctly hear Senator McKim's voice deny formality to it.</span>

                  </a>  Here they go up again, biting again and again and continuing to chime in. I'm surprised they don't want do have a discussion about radical Islam because normally they're very happy to talk about how the rest of Australia is racist—because they believe that Islam is a race—or the fact that we are over-egging a threat. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me make a point to you, Madam Acting Deputy President: I sat next to this odious character—Sheik whatever he is—who went on to tell me that no Muslim has ever committed a crime in the history of the world. That's what he said to me. He said that Osama Bin Laden and Saudi Arabia weren't responsible for the falling of the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001. This is the delusional character who purports to speak on behalf of Muslims in this country. He is an out-and-out nut job—I make no bones about that—and his brand of Islam is nutty. It is chaotic; it is dysfunctional. And the Greens will not allow it to be condemned. They've joined up in the past. They've joined up with Iranians, as the Iranians are persecuting their own citizens and hanging homosexuals. It's like a bizarre sort of red-green alliance. They've defended this sort of nonsense for far too long. Now they're denying formality to this chamber, which is their right. But they are denying formality for this chamber to pass a motion, a statement of intent, condemning the ideology of the rabid feral dogs who are out there trying to butcher Australian citizens.</span>

                  </a>  This is the disgrace. I note the huffing and puffing from Senator McKim over there. He's huffing and puffing as, just last week or the week before, we had one of these radical converts stabbing people and taking lives in the Bourke Street Mall, as referenced in this motion. Where were the Greens condemning that? They weren't. They are shameless. Now they're denying formality to this chamber to pass a motion, which is absolutely sympathetic. It is in keeping with what is important to the Australian people: a safe and orderly society. They will welcome people from all over the world, but they will have no time for the extremists who are seeking to radically overthrow, overhaul or damage the Australian citizenry and our way of life.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no more radical and dangerous ideology in this chamber than what is sitting in the Greens, because we know they are prepared to cover up the slights against the Western world, if it supports their goals. We know they are prepared to cover up the misogyny, the misandry, the sexual abuse, the rape allegations and the complaints against their own organisations, if it will further the global Greens cause. We know that they have no regard for truth or fact. They are prepared to peddle any fiction in the name of growing their own support base. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Denying formality on such a significant motion is another example of just how out of touch this radical and extreme Greens movement is with what the Australian people expect. For those who say we pass too many motions in this place, very few, if any, are more serious than this. This is not a platitude. This is not just a spurious political stunt. This is about our national security and it is about uniting the Australian people—uniting this chamber—and yet we find it fosters division because of the radical elements that are at work here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Radical Islam is a dangerous ideology, just like the radical Greens movement is a dangerous ideology. I'm amazed. They always like talking about identities and they love talking about the alphabets, Muslims, vegans and everyone else who is apparently marginalised in society, but when it comes to sticking up for the rest of Australia—for those people who entrust this place and this government and successive governments with their national security—where do they go? They go missing. They deny formality. It is an indictment upon them.</span>

Firstly, I want to reflect on the concerns, or reservations, many senators have about how formal business is being managed in this place. I understand, on this occasion, the government will support this suspension of standing orders. It's their business agenda. If they want to allow it to be diverted in this fashion, who are we to necessarily compromise that? But, in relation to this motion, I want to make it clear that Labor firmly believes that the Muslim community is already providing valuable cooperation with security and enforcement agencies. The security agencies themselves say that this cooperation is one of the most important tools they have in the fight against extremism and terrorism.</span>

In spite of what Senator Collins just said, I can't understand why anyone in this chamber would not want to support at least that aspect of the motion. I also note in passing that it calls upon Sheikh Omran to publicly retract his criticism of police and intelligence services and to denounce all radical Islamic speech and jihadism. Again, whilst that may cause some concern to some, I would think that most couldn't really object to that call to action in this motion. </span>

Why I support this motion of Senator O'Sullivan is that it demonstrates, yet again, the ultimate hypocrisy of the Greens political party. I'm not sure that I particularly supported Senator O'Sullivan's previous motion highlighting the sexual harassment and misdeeds of the Greens political party. I hadn't seen it before and I hadn't formed my opinion on what we should do. But I do think that these things should be allowed to be put to a vote.

                  </a>  I enjoy the interjections and the abuse from the Greens political party, because it again demonstrates, time and time again, the absolute and abject hypocrisy of the Greens political party. Whether or not they agree with Senator O'Sullivan's motion seems to me to be a relatively minor part of the issue. The issue is the freedom of speech. The Greens exercise that opportunity here every day in this section of the parliament. They always bring up motions that most of the rest of us have got better things to do with our time than to deal with. The Greens will further delay the Senate knowing that they don't have the numbers, but they will continue to call divisions when they know they have clearly lost the motion they have put forward. Why do they do that? You can ask them, but I guess it's again for crass political reasons, for their own small band of followers they have—a band of followers, I might say, that is getting smaller. But the way the Greens will always deny others the opportunity to speak doesn't apply to themselves. If anyone ever should deny them the opportunity to speak, there is absolute and abject outrage. The hypocrisy of the Greens political party knows no bounds. I would certainly support Senator O'Sullivan's right to put this motion as a formal motion and have the Senate determine it accordingly. </span>

Despite the sordid little fantasies of Senator Bernardi, suggesting that the Greens had asked or set up Labor to do that, I can categorically assure him and the Senate that that was not true in the slightest. Then we had a situation where Senator O'Sullivan denied Senator Di Natale—</span>

                  </a>  The point I am of course making here is that you shouldn't tarnish a large group of people because of the sins of a few members of that group. You shouldn't do it. And that's what this motion seeks to do to Muslim people. That's what it seeks to do. We are saying very clearly that of course there are Muslim people who do bad things. Of course there are Christian people who do bad things. Of course there are atheists who do bad things. There are people in most groups in our community who do bad things. You shouldn't tarnish the reputations of an entire group of people because some members of that group do bad things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to stand up for reason in this debate. We are going to stand up for facts to be placed on the record. And we are going to stand up against the ongoing demonisation of Australia's entire Muslim community by people like Senator Bernardi who believe it is in their political interests to do that. That's what we are standing up for here today: for fairness, for an acknowledgement that every group of people that has a reasonable number of people in it is going to contain people who do bad things. But we shouldn't be tarnishing those entire groups of people because of the actions of a few. That applies to the Christian churches that ran protection rackets for paedophiles as much as it applies to any other group. So I urge members to let motions be debated, to put facts on the record rather than making stuff up—like Senator Macdonald has and like Senator Bernardi has—and not tarnish large groups of people because of the actions of a few.</span>

                  </a>  The government recognises the service of Australian fire and emergency management personnel who deploy overseas, who currently can be considered for the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal. The creation of a new award in the Australian honours system or significant changes to existing awards requires a strong case that national recognition is appropriate and that existing awards don't suffice. Australian honours are created by Her Majesty the Queen, and proposals for new awards generally require the support of the chief officers of the relevant organisations, relevant state and territory ministers and then the Prime Minister. The government is advising advocates for the new medal that they should gain the support of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council and other stakeholders, which, if forthcoming, will be properly considered. Such awards are not the gift of the Senate although the government will note individual senators' views.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even with a rosy economic backdrop, the Liberals have racked up record debt and left the budget in a far worse state than they inherited from Labor, which had a global financial crisis to contend with. Let me be clear: the government has run out of excuses for more than doubling the nation's debt. The Liberals' own figures show that, on their watch, net debt has more than doubled, to hit a record high of $354.5 billion. That's a $354.5 billion debt run up by this government. And gross debt has crashed through half a trillion dollars for the first time ever in the nation's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of using the surge in revenue from this global upswing to help pay down their record and growing debt, this government, the Liberals, would rather give tax handouts to those who need them the least. Instead of building an economy that works for everyone, they choose tax handouts for the big end of town. Politics is all about choices, and I'm afraid to tell you that the Liberals are choosing tax concessions for the wealthy over everyday Australians, over better schools, over better hospitals and over renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are the worst economic managers we've ever seen. Instead of putting forward their own economic plan or policies, they would rather just fret and obsess over what we in Labor are doing in this policy space. But I guess that's what you come to expect when you have an incompetent government bereft of creditable economic or tax policy. They've been found wanting—that has been so stark and so clear about this government. The Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, would rather run a ridiculous scare campaign about Labor's policies than come up with a policy of his own. This is quite telling from a senior member of a five-year-old coalition government. Remember the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government? They have no economic policy, and no plans for wages growth except cutting penalty rates. It has actually been a bit embarrassing watching the new Treasurer trying to walk and lie at the same time; obviously, proving to be a bit much and a bit awkward—</span>

                  </a>  I withdraw the word 'lie', but what I will say is that those opposite obviously feel very, very uneasy about the truth being spoken in this chamber, because it was so obvious. The scare campaign that has been waged by the Treasurer and the fact that he has been less than truthful with the Australian people are obviously quite embarrassing for those on the other side. I'm sure many who are listening to this have seen on Twitter the video where the Treasurer has displayed his lack of ability in being truthful to the Australian community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time Mr Frydenberg and the Liberal Party attack Labor's reforms to trusts, negative gearing and refundable franking credits, that is them choosing to maintain tax concessions that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy over funding for better schools and hospitals—and I make no apology for that. I have a hot tip for those opposite, off the back of the Victorian election over the weekend, about trying to use old scare campaigns that didn't work in Victoria: they ought to take a good look at themselves and realise that the Australian public are much smarter than that. They're not going to succumb to the untruthful messages that the Treasurer and those on the other side speak about. Your doom-and-gloom predictions around sledgehammers and recessions are economically irresponsible.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly touch on the Liberals' Women's Economic Security Statement, announced last week. Minister O'Dwyer's comments were too little, too late. They are a government that over the last five years have lurched further and further to the right, and now they are in panic mode after being decimated at the Victorian state election. The coalition's Women's Economic Security Statement does nothing about the gender pay gap and nothing about the retirement income gap, which is quite serious. There is no attempt to address that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor has a plan for working Australian women, with $400 million to boost women's superannuation balances for a more secure financial future, including paying superannuation on Commonwealth paid parental leave. In our first 100 days we will restore Sunday penalty rates for up to 700,000 workers—great news for hundreds of thousands of women, particularly in my home state of Tasmania. Labor will take action to close the gender pay gap, including greater transparency and accountability for business and government, so that, if men and women are doing the same work, they get the same pay. We will introduce 10 days paid domestic violence leave to the National Employment Standards and $88 million for emergency housing—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor are the only major party with a plan to reform the tax system and concessions, make them fairer and provide structural repair to the budget and to demonstrate how we will pay for better schools and hospitals as well as pay down the debts—something that the people on that side have failed miserably to do. Labor have made the tough policy calls, and we have been up-front about the need for structural budget repair and how we'll go about achieving it fairly and responsibly. Because of our responsible approach, we've been able to commit to delivering bigger surpluses over the forward estimates and substantially bigger surpluses over the median term. As I said, those opposite have blown out the budget and got us further and further in debt—the highest debt this nation has ever seen. That's under those people, who laugh and scoff at plans that are going to provide the Australian people with something better for their future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, politics is all about choice. Labor would prefer to invest in better hospitals, schools and TAFE than spend taxpayer money helping property speculators with their sixth or seventh investment property. Labor has the boldest reform agenda of any opposition in 25 years. What we are doing is putting our policies out to the Australian people. We're an opposition that are not afraid to share our ideas, our values and our plan for the future, unlike those opposite, who have lied to the Australian people countless times. They've let down pensioners. We know, when it comes to aged care, how they've neglected to look after the most vulnerable older people in this nation. We are happy to argue these reforms based on facts, but we would never let flirtation or poor analysis drift by without calling it out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time the Liberal Party learnt the lessons of the Victorian state election and the recent by-election results and dropped the politics of fear and lies and their scare campaigns, like the one on Labor's reform to refundable franking credits. The Australian people are smart. They know when someone is trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Australians don't want the best tax loopholes in the world; they want the best schools and the best hospitals in the world. They want to know that their grandparents, parents and older relatives are looked after and respected with the best possible aged care. That's what they want from this government, but it has failed miserably. I don't believe Australians are going to be able to trust this government to turn the economy around and do something about stagnant wages. They are relying on the next election and electing a Labor government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  No, it is. Often I have to prepare for a speech, but when I read the terms of this matter of public interest I was relaxed. I was totally relaxed because I can do this one straight off the cuff, Senator. Senator, what you should do—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—is stay. You're going to get some real little lead ideas here about how to manage a good economy. Let's go back and reflect on the economy left for the Australian Labor Party at the end of Prime Minister Howard's reign. The debt was zero, for the first time in many decades. There was $60 billion dedicated to the Future Fund, and we had a healthy economy that was producing surplus after surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good senator raised the issue of surpluses. She said, 'We'll get more surpluses, bigger surpluses, quicker than this government.' Well, the last time we heard that—we didn't hear it once, we didn't hear it twice, we didn't hear it 10 or 20 times; we heard it 26 times! Twenty-six times the Labor Party declared, when they were in government, that they would produce surpluses. Of course, we know they didn't produce any. This is the party that decided the best investment this country could make, costing hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, was to put pink batts in the ceiling.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the attack made on the government with respect to reducing the amount of money—their money—that people have to pay the government in the form of taxation. It's not our money; it's their money. And what do they do with that money? I'll drop off to sleep here halfway through this, because I've had to say it here so many times. Corporations invest that money; that's what they do. That's what makes the economy go round. They invest it. They buy goods, they purchase services and employ people. They stimulate the economies in their regions, and then more people come off unemployment, which of course is a benefit to the nation and a benefit to the individual. Then they have a better standard of living; they can go and spend, and that promotes the economy further.</span>

They think I'm joking when I say that we are a party for the workers, but the coalition is now truly a party for the workers.</span>

                  </a>  I know that this is a bit sensitive for you, Senator, but these are the facts. We had a motion in this place not 20 minutes ago supporting jobs in the coal industry—supporting the coal industry, supporting new investment in the coal industry. That's going to produce more jobs for these workers, blue-collar workers, workers of the union who support the Australian Labor Party. I hope they were watching when we saw the Australian Labor Party vote against a positive motion about jobs in the coal industry. That's what it was. We said: let's celebrate the jobs in the coal industry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They supported the motion here earlier today to stop beef production in this country, not to minimise it or mitigate it; they want to stop beef production in this country, which, of course, is the policy of the Greens. Truly, we're seeing an emergence here: this coalition is getting tighter. It's getting tighter by the hour. We must have an election in the wind. We must be starting to have a little fiddle around talking about preferences, do you think? It's getting tighter. They are becoming one again. That's what the Australian people get. They don't just get the Labor Party. They won't just get the Australian Labor Party if there's a change of government; they will get a Labor-Greens government. We know what their attitude is to agriculture. Their big, sterling, touchstone policy last time was to stop the live cattle trade out of this country. Now they want to go a step further and stop beef production in the nation. They won't have to worry about exports of live animals; they want to stop the production of live animals. It's not just around beef. They can pick beef. They have already taken chickens on. They don't like chickens. They don't like sheep. They have called for the suspension of the live trade for sheep. You're a Western Australian, Mr Acting Deputy President Brockman. You know what will happen to those sheep. They will perish in the paddock. They will die an horrific death in the paddock. We have seen it with beef when the suspension of the live cattle trade happened. In a time when there were some climatic challenges around drought—normal droughts, big drought, I think the sixth biggest drought in about 100 years. We've had the millennium drought, the century drought. They all had a name; they all had a skirt and lipstick and a moustache. Of course this is the first one. There has never been any history about this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sort of rhetoric we're getting from people who want to manage the economy of this nation. The Greens-Labor alignment want to manage the economy. Last time, can I tell Australians, they left us—this is a great little sum—with a debt that was costing $1 billion a week to service. That's what they left the nation with. You wonder why there were structural deficits. It was $1 billion a week. They were borrowing a billion dollars a week to pay the interest on the debt. Even Mr and Mrs Stringbag in the suburbs understand what that means, when you borrow some money and then borrow some money to pay the debt. They absolutely know that at some stage the music stops. It's like with musical chairs: when you try to sit down there won't be any chair. You'll be flat on your back. That's what happens under Labor's economic management. It's $1 billion a week. A government's in for a term of 156 weeks. There are 150 members in the other place. Imagine this: if we didn't have to pay off Labor's debt, there would be $1 billion every electoral term that could be spent in every seat in the country. Think about it. You reflect on a division within your states and wonder what they could do with $1 billion. I know that where I live there's plenty they could do. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want to talk about education, health, investment in aged care, the National Disability Insurance Scheme—fully funded under us, not funded under the Australian Labor Party. These are people with flowery ideas. I have run into hundreds of them. They are bootleggers. They have nothing. Most of these people don't even understand basic home economics. I remember the wonderful contribution on the economy here one time by Senator Ludlam, who's no longer with us, sadly or not. I went back to understand how he could get it so wrong. I looked up his senator's register. You know what he had on his register? This is a mature man who's been in a high-paying job for a lot of the time. He had put on his register one laptop and a pair of sandshoes. That was it. You need to go back and look at it. I've got it framed—a laptop and a pair of sandshoes after 23 years in the workforce in very good positions. And they have the hide to stand up and lecture my side in relation to economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'll tell you what: we're stone deaf to what you've got to say, as are the electorate. They know. One of the most common things said to me as I move around the electorate and talk to people, when the issue comes to the economy, is, 'Labor can't manage money.' They're full of big ideas, such as the ones that were articulated by the senator in her contribution. They're full of ideas about how to take away negative gearing. They're full of ideas about how to attack self-funded retirees in this country with their franking credits. Many of these are long-term Labor people who have been wise: teachers, policemen, firemen or self-employed electricians. They are people who support the Australian Labor Party—not as much anymore, but they did support the Australian Labor Party—and who funded for their retirement. They didn't get along and just collect a pair of sandshoes and a computer. So I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I won't be lectured by the Australian Labor Party on issues of the economy, and I'm quite certain the good people of Australia won't be lectured by them either.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  Can I just begin by saying that it's great to see the Australian Labor Party's adopting a key policy and mantra developed by One Nation. Ensuring multinationals pay their fair share of tax is something that One Nation has been banging on about for some considerable time now. Let me take you back to some key points I made earlier this year when I introduced my private senator's bill which was aimed at ensuring greater transparency of what multinationals pay in the gas industry—which was voted down by the government and the opposition, by the way. By the end of the year, Australia will have exported $35 billion of liquefied natural gas. We will become, if we are not already, the largest exporter of LNG in the world. We allow companies to explore and produce the petroleum from our offshore reserves, and rightly so. These companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars creating jobs for our workers. But the true owners of these petroleum resources are the Australian people, and it is only fair that the Australian people get fair compensation for their resources, which is why Labor introduced the petroleum resource rent tax, or the PRRT, back in 1988. Unfortunately, this legislation has failed, and we get no payment for the gas that drives billions of dollars of exports. Not only do multinationals not pay for the gas, but they also don't pay tax on profits made from the sale of this gas, because they create losses on paper. It is only fair that these petroleum companies, like other multinationals operating in Australia, pay their fair share of tax. Right now, the system is not fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gas industry is worthy of more attention. The handful of companies that control our gas need to be held to account and to pay for non-renewable resources that they take and for the profits made from these non-renewable resources through corporate income tax. Australia is set to overtake Qatar as the largest exporter of gas in the world, but we will receive just a fraction of the revenue—$800 million compared to Qatar's $26.6 billion. That $800 million largely comes from the Bass Strait gas fields that supply Australia and are not for export. The very real possibility that Australia, as it becomes the world's largest exporter of LNG, may never collect any direct payments from its natural resources is simply embarrassing. Consecutive governments have failed the Australian people. Even countries that we give foreign aid to perform better in their resource revenue management than Australia. According to one report, Australia ranks 32nd in the world. We scored lower than Botswana and Ivory Coast. It is time for the government to act and stop the ripping-off of the people of Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak to this excellent matter of public importance. Labor want to bring back the fair go—that's the bottom line for our position—whereas the government are doing nothing to make this country more equal. It's true that we've had 27 years of continuous economic growth, but, when you talk to average Australians, as I do very often, you find that average Australians do not feel that they have been getting their fair share of the benefits of that economic growth. I do a lot of doorknocking. When you talk to people on their front doorstep, they know something is wrong with our system. They know that company profits are going well and that companies are doing quite well, but, when it comes to the wages of ordinary working people, there's something wrong with our system. We know that those opposite have ripped billions of dollars out of school budgets and hospitals across the country. They prioritise tax cuts for the top end of town, their big business mates and the big banks over everyday working Australians. We have a bigger, better and fairer tax plan to ensure that the benefits of Australia's unprecedented economic growth flow through to everyone in our country, not just the privileged few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to remind people that, in fact, Labor had much better and fairer tax cuts for the 10 million working Australians. Under our proposal everyone earning less than $125,000 a year would receive a bigger tax cut compared to under the Liberals' proposal. More than four million people would be better off by $398 a year, compared to the government's position. With Labor's tax refund a teacher on $65,000 would receive a tax cut of $928 a year, and a couple earning $90,000 and $50,000 respectively would receive a tax cut of $1,855 a year. The difference between the government and Labor on this particular issue could not be more stark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to cracking down on corporate tax dodgers it's really interesting that the recent settlement that the Australian Taxation Office achieved with BHP of $529 million, in relation to their transferred pricing arrangements, was actually done under laws that the coalition voted against. These laws were passed by the former Labor government in 2013 and were opposed by the Liberal and National Party members on the grounds that they were retrospective. Really, Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg owe the Australian people an apology, because, if they had their way, the budget would be millions of dollars worse off. These laws were also used in the 2017 Chevron judgement handed down by the High Court, which saw $340 million added to the budget bottom line. The government will pursue the mythology that they're cracking down on tax loopholes, but, in reality, the hard work was done by the previous Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this coalition government debt is rising faster than it did during the global financial crisis. It does gall me, somewhat, to hear Senator O'Sullivan talking about debt in the way that he did, because it's quite clear that this government has blown net debt out by double. They have got quite a nerve to raise this particular issue. As I said, if they had gotten their way back in 2013, the multinational tax loopholes would be open and government debt would be even higher still. So the coalition really should get on board with what Labor wants to do in terms of multinational tax avoidance—that is, tighten debt-deduction loopholes used by multinational companies, cap deductions for managing tax affairs at $3,000 and close the debt-deduction loopholes to ensure consistent treatment in related party financing arrangements. I could go on; I've got so much to talk about when it comes to multinational tax avoidance. But, in conclusion, we have a strong reform agenda. We have the policies. The policies are informed, costed and transparent. We need a Labor government now to make sure that the benefits of our economic recovery and unprecedented growth flow through to all Australians.</span>

All my life, Labor has sent us broke—whether it be back in the nineties in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania or New South Wales. And look what they've done in Queensland. They're heading towards $80 billion of debt for the 4.5 million people living there. Of course, the nineties were the days of Mr Keating—borrow, borrow, spend, spend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've talked about investment, jobs, fairness and taxation. Let me take you back to a bit of history. On 1 January 2013, Labor brought in a tax bill and it meant this: if you had an income of more than $250,000 a year, including superannuation, you could not get a tax deduction for investing in a business. I found that out personally when I bought the farm with my wife Nancy. You could buy as many houses as you liked and negative gear them to get a tax deduction. And it still stands today; I hope we change it in the next budget. If you're a doctor, barrister, QC, solicitor, dentist or whatever, and you earn more than $250,000 total income and super, if you go to borrow some money to invest in a farm, a business to employ people, to grow, to export, to produce food or whatever, you cannot get a tax deduction. How crazy is that? The ones who can actually afford to invest in business are the ones who have no incentive to invest in business because, when they borrow money, they can't claim a tax deduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is Labor's way of growing the economy—don't let those high-income earners invest in businesses; get them to buy houses. We could have bought houses. Any dentist, politician, doctor, QC or whatever could go and buy what they wanted by way of houses under Labor; but don't invest in business and grow the jobs and the economy—that would be very bad! As I said, that is a fact and it still stands today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a great article by Terry McCrann just recently about Labor's negative gearing. What Labor plans to do with negative gearing, with the help of the Greens in the Senate, would hit both home owners and renters—nothing surer. Terry McCrann said: 'For the same time—and this shows how really dumb the whole exercise is—it wouldn't actually cut the big tax deductions investors get from negative gearing for a very long time.' That is to say it would very effectively hurt owners and renters but it wouldn't get the existing negative gearers. Terry McCrann continued: 'What Shorten and Bowen propose would be disastrous for everyone, including their own government's fiscal position. For anyone who owns a home, Labor will make it worth less. Labor's attack on negative gearing is one of the three policies that directly attack investors and investment. In combination, they would be devastating. The other two are a big increase in capital gains tax and reducing dividend franking credits.' The final line in the article said: 'It's the politics of envy and stupidity.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the franking credits. Self-funded retirees put a lot of money aside. Interest rates are very low, so they buy shares. Those shares could be fully franked dividends they receive; the company's paid the tax to Canberra here. What does Labor want to do? Instead of giving them a rebate for that when they have a very small income, they are going to tax them again. Taxing them twice is the way they'll increase their 'fair taxation'. These are battlers—people who have reared their family, invested in a home or two, educated their kids and saved their money. They might be a married couple who have worked hard. They are the ones Labor is targeting. They were the people Labor used to represent, decades ago—working people. But it's not the case these days. They want to go after them. Why? Because they had a go!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to taxation, we know the $200 billion extra taxation Labor will bring in if they win government. We know what will happen to electricity prices. We are swimming in energy but we have the highest electricity price of OECD countries. Labor will bring in more of the same—renewable energy targets, more unreliable electricity, more cost, more expense for businesses and households. They call it fairness; I call it stupidity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="275424" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STORER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  This matter of public importance invites us to 'build an economy that works for all'. It was the two rounds of reform to the tax and transfer system of the Hawke and Howard years, along with the tariff cuts in the 1990s, that set up and continued the prosperity that Australia has enjoyed for more than a quarter of a century. Unfortunately, growth, productivity and wages have all started to slip in recent times, and Australia has become less equal. A paramount question for all policymakers should be: how do we restore a society in which prosperity can return to the levels Australians have come to expect and fairness to which they are entitled? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that a comprehensive and fair reform of the tax and transfer system is a large part of the answer. It was behind my decision to oppose the government's company tax cuts on the basis that the modelling did not bear out the claims of the benefits they said they would provide for the community and the economy. I saw it as irresponsible to make such huge financial commitments and made the point repeatedly that $35 billion of revenue foregone would be better reserved for other purposes, not least to accelerate a return to budget balance and to repay debt. But there are other reasons as well—for example, there is evidence that spending on properly scrutinised infrastructure would provide a greater boost to growth as well as employment and wages and provide needed and long-lasting infrastructure for people in Sydney, Melbourne and other locations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the question of welfare spending. For many months I've been pressing for an increase in Newstart and allied payments to a level that will ensure jobseekers need not live in poverty and will have the means to find work. This is not just an aspiration of the welfare lobby. No less an organisation than the Business Council of Australia has been stating since 2012 that the rate of Newstart allowance, at its current level, no longer meets a reasonable standard of adequacy and itself presents a barrier to employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What all this leads to is consideration of the state of the tax and transfer system. It's now two decades since there has been substantial action on comprehensive tax reform. That was, of course, the introduction of the GST. Since then we've had the landmark Henry review, with seven principal reforms and 149 recommendations, but none of these sensible proposals were acted on. The Gillard government did try to introduce the super tax on mining profits, but the introduction was hampered. That was just one element of the Henry review's recommendations. It's a reminder that tax reform is all but impossible if policymakers cherrypick the recommendations of expert panels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Budget Office pointed out this year that maintaining Commonwealth government revenue at recent levels as a share of GDP will lead to an increased reliance on taxes on labour income through the personal income tax system. The percentage of household spending subject to GST, for example, has fallen from 61 to 56 per cent, and fuel excise has fallen from 1.5 per cent to a little over one per cent. Then there is the question of resource rent taxes, which have fallen from two-tenths of one per cent of GDP to under one-tenth of one per cent of GDP. In short, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, an array of taxes from GST, alcohol and tobacco, FBT, company taxes, and taxes on fuel products have all fallen as a percentage of GDP since the beginning of the century. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mike Keating, a former head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, has argued that the assumptions behind the government's fiscal projections are too optimistic and that there are good reasons to believe the rate of growth will not return to trend and nor will wages or productivity. He argued that commitments already made by this government imply the need for additional revenue to the order of three per cent of GDP and that, unless taxation revenue is sufficient to pay for functions like R&amp;D, education, training, health and infrastructure and to maintain a socially inclusive society, the economic stagnation experienced over the last decade will most likely continue. This is an uncomfortable prediction but one which should make all parliamentarians sit up and take notice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Comprehensive tax reform is never easy. It requires leaders with courage prepared to take the community into their confidence. It is not a goal that can be achieved with one speech or grabbing hold of one tax initiative. If we are to build an economy that works for all, fair, sustainable and comprehensive tax reform will be one of the most important building blocks. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I'm sure that I'm not the only member in this chamber who, over the years, has been told by voters that one of the things they're disappointed in about politics is the fact, or the view, that there's not enough between the parties on issues. I think that, at the coming election, this will be an example of a time when there is a vast difference between the different policies that are being put forward by the parties and the different visions for Australia that the parties hold. There is no area in which there is a greater difference between the parties about their vision for Australia than when it comes to the economy. Whether it be on matters of tax, on workplace laws, on education and training or on the key levers of building an economy for the future, there is a massive difference between the government on the one hand and the Labor opposition on the other. As I say, whether it's about tax, workplace laws, education and training or any of the other major economic levers that a government has, it is clear that the government, the LNP, is on the side of big business and the wealthiest individuals in our community and the Labor opposition is actually on the side of small and medium businesses, the average working family and subcontractors in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's step through each of the major economic levers: tax, workplace laws, and education and training. To begin, tax is probably the best example, the easiest example, where you can see that this is a government that is obsessed with getting more money into the pockets of big business and the wealthiest individuals in our community rather than average working people or small businesses. We know that for months, in fact years, it was the Senate, led by Labor and backed by some of the crossbenchers, that resisted the government's repeated attempts to cut tax rates for big business. If the government had its way, we would have shelved billions of dollars towards big business—to the banks and the largest corporations in this country—to help them reduce their tax bill, funded by further cuts to education, hospitals and infrastructure right across the country. It was only because of the resistance shown by Labor senators, backed by crossbench senators, that we were able to stop the tax cuts for big business from going through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were, unfortunately, witness to many other pieces of legislation that the government put forward over this term which have reduced tax rates for the highest income earners in this country. On the other hand, Labor has actually put up initiative after initiative to try to reduce tax rates for low- to middle-income earners. If anyone's going to be getting a tax cut in this country, it should be low- to middle-income earners, not big business and not millionaires, who are the only people that this government seems to have as a priority when it comes to tax rates. Of course, a vast number of tax loopholes exist within our system at the moment which are overwhelmingly exploited by the highest income earners in our community, whether it be the tax havens that are established by the wealthiest individuals, whether it be the misuse of trusts to minimise tax, whether it be the ability to claim massive tax deductions for seeing your accountant or your lawyer to reduce your tax obligation, or whether it be your ability—and this is one I didn't even know about—to claim, as a tax deduction, a trip to your tax haven so that you can meet with your accountant and inspect your tax haven. You can claim the airfare that you incur as a deduction itself. That is absolutely outrageous, and most Australians would say it's outrageous. That's something that Labor wants to crack down on, and it's something that the government has shown no interest in whatsoever to try to fix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a whole range of tax matters, we see, time and time again, this government lining up with big business and with the highest income earners in our community rather than middle-income earners and low-income earners. It's no surprise that we see results like we did on the weekend in Victoria or, before that, in federal by-elections, where middle- to low-income earners are making very clear that they know this government is not on their side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages and workplace laws is another area where average Australians have missed out, time and time again, from this government. We know for a fact that wages in this country have essentially stopped growing if you compare them to inflation. Inflation keeps going up, goods and services keep going up, people's bills keep going up, and wages are barely keeping pace with the increases that people are seeing in their bills and in the cost of living. This government has no answer for it. The only answer it can come up with is to give big business and employers even greater power to screw down working people and screw down the wages that they receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Labor has a different view. Our view is that the only way to get the economy moving, growing in a way that benefits the entire community, is to make sure that average Australian working people get more money in their pockets through increases in their wages. That's why we've put forward a range of policies already, before we even get to an election campaign, which will go to the heart of trying to put more money in the pockets of average Australian working people by increasing their wages. We've tried repeatedly to reverse the cuts to penalty rates that were handed down by the Fair Work Commission and have been backed in repeatedly by this government. We want to reverse those penalty rate cuts and make sure that Australian working people get the wages they deserve. The best way to make sure that regional economies and economies right across Australia are ticking over is to make sure that people have more money in their pockets to go and spend in shops, in cafes, in restaurants—in the businesses in the community. Cutting people's penalty rates and making sure that they are paid less is doing harm to household budgets and it is doing harm to economic communities right across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've said that we want to crack down on the abuse of labour hire that we see particularly in many parts of regional Australia as well as in our big cities. It is outrageous that a worker can be engaged as a labour hire worker to do exactly the same work as someone who's employed on a permanent basis but get paid less and get worse terms and conditions in their employment. That has to stop. We recognise that there are times when, due to seasonal fluctuations in work, employers do need to bring on people on a short-term basis, including via labour hire. That's fine, but it is not fine for employers to keep engaging people as labour hire for the sole reason of reducing their wages bill. Again, it is bad for working people and it is bad for communities to have less money going in the pockets of working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also said that we want to review the abuse of casualisation, of casual employees. This notion of permanent casuals has gotten well out of hand and should not be allowed to continue. Again, there are times when people are legitimately engaged as casuals, but the idea that someone can be engaged as a casual year after year, when their working hours basically don't change, has to stop. People deserve more job security than that, and people deserve to go into work, to know what they're going to be paid and to know that they're going to be kept on from week to week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes beyond working people as well. We want to do more for subcontractors. This is an issue that comes up repeatedly on the Gold Coast, where my office is based, where we see many, many construction firms go under, owing subcontractors money. All too often we see phoenix companies with directors who go from company to company, closing down their business, trashing their assets, leaving bills unpaid and leaving subcontractors in the lurch. That sort of thing has to stop as well. It's the same on education and training. The government's agenda is clear in imposing cuts to schools, to universities, to TAFEs, to training. It's Labor that actually wants to inject more money into that system to make sure that people have the skills that are going to be needed into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, from time to time you hear people saying that there's not enough of a difference between the parties. Well, in the coming election that is not going to be the case. There is a very clear difference between the parties on how the economy should be managed, and it is only Labor that is putting forward an economic agenda that has the interests of low- and middle-income earners at heart. The government is over there wanting to cut tax rates for big business, cut funding for schools, cut funding for unis, cut funding for training, make it more and more difficult for Australians to get a wage rise and make more Australian workers suffer penalty rate cuts, casual work and labour hire. That's the government's view. Over here, on the other hand, federal Labor is promising to crack down on the tax loopholes that only the wealthy are exploiting, to make sure that we have the money to fund our schools, our unis, our training and our TAFEs and to make sure that people have the skills that will be needed in the future. We need fair workplace laws, we need fair taxation systems and we need fair education and training, and it will only come from Labor. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  It won't come as any surprise to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, that, whilst I agree with Senator Watt that there is a vast difference between the parties, I disagree with pretty much everything else he said. As I've said in this place a number of times, this is a government getting on with the job, and it's the Labor Party who wants to play politics. I've spoken in the last few weeks of parliament on three MPIs, and each of them has been Labor trying to pivot to a more positive agenda; but in doing so they just reveal so many positive things that this government has achieved over the last few years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this MPI talk about? 'An economy that works for all'. I was lucky enough to be out in the electorate of Fremantle late last week with our recently endorsed candidate for Fremantle, Nicole Robins. It's a great story, and she's a great person. She's 29 years of age and has been on the local government in the electorate of Fremantle for a decade. In going out and about, we met with some small businesses, the first of which, in answer to the question, 'What's the most important thing government can do?' said, 'Keep getting taxes as low as possible.' They gave extraordinary credit to this government for driving particular taxes on small and family businesses down as much as possible. Taxation remains a great area of concern for small business, but they acknowledge that this government has led the way in reform of our tax system, particularly for those small and medium-sized enterprises, and they trust us to continue to do so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The MPI also talks about multinational tax avoidance and tax in general. This is a government that has followed through on multinational tax avoidance, has made significant inroads into making sure that things like transfer pricing and phoenixing activity are reduced as much as possible, for the very simple reason that if a company is not paying its fair share of tax that puts increased burden on others. Tax needs to be as fair as possible and as low as possible. This is a government that's been following through on that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference with those opposite is pretty stark. Senator Reynolds would certainly be aware of the front page story in <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span> this morning, 'Franking losers revealed'. Labor's proposed changes to franking credits will hurt many tens of thousands of individuals from our home state of Western Australia. In fact, up to 85,000 Western Australians would lose significant amounts of money under Labor's plan to double tax franking credits—on average, $12,000 a year under the ALP's policy. In the electorate of O'Connor, which is the large regional electorate in the south-west and south-east of Western Australia, more than 6,000 people would be affected by Labor's double taxation arrangements, including an example I've talked about before, a self-funded retiree in Albany. Glenn Diggins is his name, and he has said it's okay for me to use his name in this place. He is someone who has funded his own retirement, is not deriving a pension and is of very modest means. He doesn't have a large superannuation balance by anyone's estimation. He would have his income slashed by a third under Labor's policy. He would lose $10,000 out of around $30,000. That is an extraordinary thing for a party that claims to be champion of the underdog to propose. It's an absolutely shocking set of circumstances that we have with a potential Labor government coming to power. Nationally 900,000 people would be affected by this double taxation change. Around 200,000 self-managed super funds will be affected by the changes, 96 per cent of which have a taxable income of less than $87,000. This is like Mr Diggins from Albany. It's someone with a very modest income from their superannuation fund who is going to be hit significantly by this proposed change. This is not an abstract set of figures. This is someone's real income in retirement—someone who has done the right thing by this country, who has done the right thing by putting money away under a certain set of rules. They expect to be able to look after themselves into their old age and they want to be able to look after themselves into their old age, and they risk having one-third of their income taken from them. It's quite remarkable that we could ever see that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What could be more important in 'an economy that works for all', as this MPI describes it, than the creation of full-time jobs? And that is where this government has succeeded so strongly—putting in place the circumstances that allow business to employ. The latest ABS job figures that came out just last week show that the economy has added more than 300,000 jobs in the past year, including 238,800 new full-time jobs. That is 238,800 people who are now in full-time work, who can support their families, save for the future and create a life for themselves in this country, which is the Lucky Country. This government is very proud that it has put in place the preconditions which enable full-time employment to stand at a record high of over 8.7 million people. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was steady at five per cent. This is the equal lowest rate since 2011. Again, the unemployment rate is such a positive reflection of (a) where the economy is currently at and (b) the positive result that is for individual Australians and individual Australian families. We should never underestimate or in any way downplay the importance of a job and what it adds to a person's life. It is a significant achievement, and this government is very proud that, since coming into office in 2013, 1.18 million jobs have been created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think everyone listening would acknowledge that higher taxes, which are what those opposite are proposing, will only have a dampening effect. They will have a dampening effect on the economy; they will have a dampening effect on the chance of more people getting jobs. When I was out and about with Nicole Robins in Fremantle, those small businesses were saying, 'We would love to employ more people, but we are concerned about a Labor government coming into power.' So we need to generate confidence for people to invest in their own business and their own lives, to employ people and to create those jobs of the future. In building the economy that we have today, that is exactly what this government has done, and the runs are on the board. We see it in terms of the growth figures for the economy. We see it in terms of the unemployment rate. We see it in terms of the number of jobs that have been created in the economy over the last five years. I think that it's very important that all Australians reflect on that as they consider where this country is heading into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the latest debacle—I'd call it a debacle, anyway—in terms of the moneys that have been granted out of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy for the Northern Territory Seafood Council, for the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory and for the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, those being $150,000, $170,000 and $165,000, which adds up to nearly half a million dollars.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find this particularly egregious when just last week an organisation in Western Australia found out that they weren't going to have their funding renewed out of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. I'm talking about an organisation that has been working in the community in Western Australia for a number of years, the Jacaranda Community Centre. I think Senator Pratt knows that organisation and the excellent work they do. For a long time they have been providing support for Aboriginal members of their community and employing Aboriginal workers, working to support families and to keep Aboriginal children from going into care, supporting the children to attend school with a school attendance strategy with extra supports. They have been providing Aboriginal family support and a school inclusion program in Western Australia, in southern metropolitan Perth, for a long time. They have been employing, as I said, Aboriginal workers. And they have a number of families that they are currently supporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, they will not be funded beyond Christmas. They've got five weeks notice. They have been trying to find out for a long time what was happening with the next round of funding, and they were told just last week that they were not going to be funded. So they've had five weeks notice—and that includes to their Aboriginal workers and, very importantly, to the families that they have supported. There has been no discussion. Senator Smith, I'm sure you also know the Jacaranda centre and the excellent work that they do. There has been no transition planning, because they haven't been able to because they've only just found out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This excellent service, which is providing much-needed support to Aboriginal families in our community in Perth, is not going to be funded anymore—when this level of funding has been handed out to organisations that I'd argue very strongly should not be funded out of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. People in this place will know that I have been extremely critical of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy since it started, since the government took out over half a billion dollars in funding, and also critical of the process around the way that the grants were given out. The ANAO reports and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's inquiry were very critical of that process, and I have very definitely been critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know of the good work this organisation does. They are not being funded and were only given five weeks notice. They have been chasing this funding. I know that for a fact, because they were asking me whether I could raise the matter and whether I knew anything. I'm sure they've spoken to other members of parliament, and other members of parliament know the good work they do. It's a travesty that this organisation will no longer be funded, that good Aboriginal support program workers are going to lose their jobs and that Aboriginal families will no longer have that support to keep the vital connection to school and to help kids into school, stay in school and overcome the problems that they face. It's not just local families; there are a lot of Aboriginal families that move down to Perth for medical support. If one member of the family comes down, the whole family comes down. They often don't have accommodation and don't have that connection to schools. Jacaranda works with those families as well. They are doing excellent work. My big question is: why weren't they funded? Surely they should be funded and surely, at the very least, there should be a process to help transition those families to other forms of support. At this stage, Jacaranda doesn't know who is going to be providing that support. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

The government's response is that the government will not be complying with the order for the production of documents, claiming a public interest immunity in relation to the report on the grounds of cabinet confidentiality. They're saying that the KPMG report referred to in the Senate motion is a cabinet-in-confidence denoted document. I'm sure this has been said on numerous occasions: you take a trolley of something through the cabinet and say, 'It's been to cabinet.' This is an issue of huge public interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Centrelink has been missing millions and millions of phone calls. To be fair, previous governments, from both the major parties, required efficiency dividends, and staff were lost. But, most recently, a lot of staff were lost from Centrelink. Then we saw the consequence—millions and millions and millions of unanswered calls, not to mention people waiting for long periods of time in Centrelink offices. Then they go for a trial of 250 call centres. They get a report done. They now say it's cabinet in confidence so that we can't see what the findings of the report actually have been. They claim it's enough evidence to expand contract staff. The next lot is 1,000 contract staff for call centres, plus another 1,000 for the compliance section in Centrelink—surprise, surprise!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of documents should not be cabinet-in-confidence documents. They should be publicly available. It's public money that's being spent on a service that is absolutely critical to some of the most vulnerable members of our community, who are getting poor service because of lack of enough staff and lack of training for the staff. The staff are being passed from call to call because the calls haven't been able to be answered. The government claims that it's worked. Well, the feedback that we get from people is that they are not getting the support that they need to deal with the complicated issues that they face. This is a travesty, the fact that the government won't provide this document is outrageous, and we will continue to pursue it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As chair of the committee, I say that it needs to be clear before this place that it is not necessary for faith based educational institutions to use legislative exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act in relation to LBGTI students or, indeed, any other attributes, such as pregnancy or marital status, within the Sex Discrimination Act. The evidence before the committee made it very clear that schools have not been actively using this exemption, and almost all schools said they did not need these exemptions to exist. In addition, the small numbers of institutions that said they'd like these exemptions to remain on the statute books also, nevertheless, reiterated to the committee that they did not want to, and they would not, discriminate against any student.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received over 160 submissions from stakeholders on both sides of this debate in relation to LBGTI rights but also in relation to sex and pregnancy discrimination. I have to commend the secretariat for the wonderful job they've done in organising this inquiry, from the taking of submissions to holding public hearings in just 13 days. Some might like to criticise the short time frame for this debate, but this has been a very simple and straightforward inquiry. It was brought on in response to what has already been very significant public debate on the issue of existing exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act, which was originally sparked by the leaked recommendations from the Ruddock report into religious freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence to the committee showed very strongly how much the community was largely, frankly, unaware that the exemptions even existed. I have to say—and I won't name names, in terms of the evidence before the committee—that even those who were there to try to defend the exemptions and their existence had no idea how they worked or, frankly, no idea of the attributes that the exemptions covered. This debate is not new to many Australians, but it's clear that most were unaware that these exemptions have allowed faith based schools to discriminate against students and, indeed, teachers for a great many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the report I have tabled states, organisations on both sides of this debate are calling for the full release of the Ruddock report so they can see the recommendations of that report in their full context. What is extraordinary is that the government was handed this report back in May this year, has not made the report public and is now escalating community concern about the issues raised in it, because it refuses to lay them out on the table for public consideration or comment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 October, the Prime Minister himself said that the report had not even been considered by the cabinet. It was very clear that this was an attempt to gag debate on this issue, just as the government was starting to run out of oxygen in the Wentworth by-election. We see that the report from the expert panel received more than 15,000 submissions. Surely, this report needs to see the light of day. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister's statement in the context of responding to this report, affirming that the government would move to protect lesbian and gay students from being expelled on the basis of their sexuality in faith based schools, was very, very welcome. Submissions to the inquiry show that, overwhelmingly, schools do not want to discriminate against LGBTI children in schools, nor do they want to discriminate against pregnant students. Frankly, they could not, before the committee, assert any reason for doing so. Even the schools that said they had ethos and religious paradigms that might contradict, said they would want to manage it in the context of their teachers and said that there was no justification for discriminating against students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most positively, there were a great many witnesses. From the Carey Baptist Grammar School, a faith based school in Victoria with 2½ thousand students enrolled, there was strong support for not only the repeal of these exemptions but also very holistic and supportive environments, particularly for their LGBTI students. They are a co-educational college and have enrolled students as boys, students as girls and students who do not necessarily identify as male or female or transgender. The school has welcomed same-sex couples to attend their ball and say they don't discriminate in their employment practices or in their enrolment of students. The principal made clear his faith based school's proposition on current exemptions when he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Carey will never change in its opposition to the current legislation which allows religious schools to discriminate against staff or students on the basis of their gender identity or sexual orientation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very much a position I welcome. As one witness said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... once you enrol a student, you're making a commitment to that student ...  forever ...</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, this is a sentiment that was shared by almost all schools, in terms of their commitment to their students and the argument that they would not want to see their own school or any other school discriminate. This statement about student enrolment really highlights how important a student's relationship with their school is. I spoke to very religious schools in the course of the inquiry who said that they wanted to support their LGBTI students and that those students should be able to thrive in an environment free from discrimination. Overwhelmingly, the committee has seen that the majority of Australians would agree with that statement, because we, as a community, believe in equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that remains, I want to reiterate that the government must release the Ruddock report. It should immediately amend the Sex Discrimination Act to remove the exemption that currently enables faith based schools to expel and discriminate against students on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, pregnancy or any other personal attribute covered in the Sex Discrimination Act. I want to highlight that this report also strongly endorsed the fact that we need to take a look at teachers in the context of discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many staff and students in faith-based schools fearing persecution have suppressed their sexual preference or gender identity and/or their marital status and have been and are being harmed as a result</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are words from Mr Anthony Odgers of the Independent Education Union. It is not necessary to justify the use of legislative exemptions that are harmful to LGBTI people, to pregnant women and to people who might be divorced, but it is the threat that these exemptions could be used against them that causes the harm. Students and teachers being forced to suppress their identity does indeed create long-term anxiety and prevents them from living as their authentic self. Mr Odgers said it was the experience of the union that only a small and diminishing minority of employers in non-government schools seek to or do utilise the exemptions from discrimination legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In making these recommendations, the committee recommends that removing discrimination against teachers and other school staff will go beyond the Sex Discrimination Act, which might be why we can't act on these parts immediately. However, this government should get on with what it said it would do and repeal the exemptions in relation to student— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  I am pleased to be presenting the dissenting report of coalition senators, signed by Senator Macdonald, the deputy chair, and Senators Hume, Abetz, Stoker, Duniam, O'Sullivan and Brockman. Can I start by thanking Senator Stoker as the principal author of this report. It is a difficult area, and her work in researching and considering complex issues has facilitated the preparation of our report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The context of this referral was the introduction of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, the bill by the Australian Greens, together with the leak in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> of recommendations purporting to be from the Ruddock review. The bill proposes to remove the existing exemptions at section 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act provided to educational institutions that are conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed. Those exemptions cover the employment of staff, the engagement of contract workers and the provision of education and training. Can I say at the outset that the committee was not established to undertake an examination of very substantial issues raised by this question in good faith. It has been hurried in a way that exposes its true purpose—namely, to provide a platform for some Labor and Greens senators to project their predetermined views onto a larger stage for their own political advantage, and those involved should be condemned for doing so. It is therefore not surprising that coalition senators cannot support the majority report, and we set out our reasons in the dissenting report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, it is our view that the committee's work demonstrates the need for further consideration to be given to a positive and standalone protection of religious freedom in Australia. I want to touch briefly on some key elements of our report. We look at inconsistencies with relevant international law. The bill has two paragraphs and it is confined to only one of the applicable rights: the right to equality and non-discrimination. There is no reference to religious freedom. It is one-sided and inadequate consideration of applicable human rights. Indeed, as our report shows, the bill undermines human rights in the name of arbitrarily selected human rights in a way that we can say is not permissible in international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our report looks at the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and examines the importance of religious institutional autonomy. The principal protection to religious freedom is in article 18 of the covenant, which protects freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It's a protection which extends to both individuals and institutions. We look at the UN General Assembly's Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, which enfolds, within that protection, the right to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions. The provision of education is recognised as a charitable purpose in our law and has also been recognised as such with various statements of the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, as cited in our report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note the Australian Human Rights Commission has, in the past, recognised that special provisions for religious institutions are appropriate. Our report also examines exemptions for religious schools existing to balance religious freedom with non-discrimination. The leaked report includes a recommendation that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments should have regard to the Siracusa principle that states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All limitation clauses shall be interpreted strictly and in favor of the rights at issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill fails to satisfy the requirement of proportionality as it extinguishes the right to religious freedom for a right that can be maintained through other means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also examine article 18(4) of the covenant that not only protects the right to establish private religious schools but also the rights of parents who don't wish their children to participate in religious instruction provided in public schools and who may excuse their children from that teaching. We look at the establishment and maintenance of faith based schools in accordance with their religious freedom rights and necessitates their ability to exercise discretion over their leadership, their staff and their volunteers, and we demonstrate how the bill would breach international law by preventing religious schools from maintaining their distinct religious ethos. This includes examining how failure to recognise the rights of faith based institutions would strip the wider community of the unique voices of such bodies. We conclude that the bill amounts to religious discrimination in that it imposes a burden on religious believers that they alone encounter on the basis of religious conviction. In light of these considerations, the bill's proposal is more restrictive of religious freedom than is required and is not proportionate to achieve the asserted countervailing rights under international human rights laws that Australia has ratified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our report particularly focuses on certain distinct considerations which arise in respect of students within faith based schools. This was summed up in evidence by Christian schools that they have no desire to expel students on the grounds of sexuality, orientation or gender identity. However, in the absence of exemptions, schools have no adequate legal protection to teach in accordance with widely-held Christian beliefs regarding sexuality, gender and relationships to manage the school community and student behaviour in ways that are appropriate to the faith of the school and employ only people who share their beliefs and manifest those beliefs in their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During hearings witnesses were asked to provide examples of cases in which the legislative exemptions have been involved or invoked. Understandably, due to the sensitive nature of the matter, several submitters provided confidential examples. However, in concluding that, as the exemptions are not being used against students, there is no reason to maintain them, the majority report appears to misunderstand that in certain circumstances even the mere making of a request that a student or staff member respect the school's values could be an action that requires reliance on the exemptions to be lawful, at least as far as the law currently stands. Indeed, our report outlines various instances, provided in camera, where reliance was placed on the exemptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our report also considers other important factors, including constitutional implications of the bill and its potential breach of constitutional protection of the free exercise of religion contained in section 116 of the Constitution. We look at public funding and liberal autonomy. Alternative models are examined in the report, including its various advantages and disadvantages. We look at state laws and the interaction of state and Commonwealth laws. We look at the best interests of the child test, including the importance of balancing the interests of other students in the school community. What's very clear is that there is a pressing need for protection of the rights of individuals to have the freedom to practise their faith, including when they come together to form schools and other religiously based organisations. It has brought to the fore the desirability of legislation that protects this right, along with the need for several Commonwealth acts to be amended consequentially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we reject the majority committee report, for the reasons outlined therein, and instead recommend that the government give further consideration to legislation that would enshrine and protect the right of religious freedom and make it clear that religious schools and religious institutions—universities—are permitted to operate in accordance with the doctrines, tenets and beliefs of their particular faith. Of course, to do anything less than this would have the effect of depriving those institutions of the ability to teach their beliefs and operate consistently with their ethos. It would also assist if there was a nationally consistent approach to the issue of discrimination of this kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing exemptions for schools in the SDA should not be eroded unless adequate protections for religious freedom are afforded in their place. For this reason, we believe that further investigation and consultation is required on the issues raised by the majority recommendations. Clearly this matter needs to be the subject of serious and intense consultation with schools, religious leaders, parents, teachers and all other stakeholders and cannot be adequately dealt with in this rushed inquiry. We recognise that the <span style="font-style:italic;">SMH</span>'s coverage of the Ruddock review leaks caused concern in the community, and this committee process has made it plain that in practice schools have been focused on the pastoral support of all students, irrespective of their gender or sexual orientation. Of course, the focus of us as a parliament must be to ensure that we set the conditions to ensure that religious schools remain able to do so in accordance with their religious ethos, and therefore it's very important— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:03</span>):  This report of our Senate inquiry into discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people in schools is incredibly important and very timely. The inquiry has brought to light important evidence demonstrating just how damaging, how dangerous and how harmful discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in faith based schools is. The Greens introduced an amendment to the original motion setting up this inquiry to ensure that the final reporting date was today, not next year, because removing discrimination in faith based schools is urgent. I want to thank the committee for the incredible work they have done in bringing together the evidence and drafting the report that has resulted in us being able to report today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing discrimination is urgent. Even the Prime Minister recognised that, last month. He said that we needed to act now, that we needed to act urgently, to remove discrimination against students in school. During the hearing of the inquiry and in the submissions that were made to the inquiry we heard how urgent it was from the LGBTQ+ people who gave evidence about their experiences being discriminated against in religious schools. We heard very many moving personal stories, including from a trans woman who was fired from the Catholic school that she had worked at and still can't find a new job, six months on, with Christmas around the corner and five dependants to provide for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from gay, lesbian and bisexual teachers who are afraid to be themselves at school. They are not out to their colleagues. They're having to pretend that their partner is just a friend, having to do things like attending the school formal and not being able to hold the hand of their partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told by some of the schools that presented evidence to the committee that, yes, they didn't want to discriminate against people just on the basis of their same-sex attraction or their gender diversity, but they were advocating for it. They weren't able to tell me whether a couple holding hands, say at the school speech night, was advocacy or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is discrimination. This is Australia in 2018. It's where we passed marriage equality just on a year ago, where we pride ourselves on celebrating our diversity. In Australia in 2018, discrimination has no place in any of our schools, whether they are faith based schools or public schools, whether they are primary schools, secondary schools or tertiary institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens welcome and support the report's recommendations to remove discrimination against students. However, we consider that the recommendations do not go far enough. The Greens' additional comments expand on them. We are calling for discrimination to be removed against teachers and other school staff as well. There are simply no grounds for any further delay in removing discrimination for all people in all of our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schools should be discrimination-free zones for all LGBTQ+ people, regardless of whether they are a student, a staff member or a rainbow family. The school is such an important place in shaping young minds and is an arena in which young people develop their sense of self. It's an area that should be protected, where young people are not discriminated against by their peers or the institution in which they learn. It's important that young people aren't growing up soaking up a message that the legal and political system allows discrimination against same-sex-attracted and gender-diverse teachers and staff. It's important that teachers and staff as well as students feel safe in the school environment. Our schools should be teaching our kids about respect and about equality. What message does it send to young people if LGBTIQ+ staff can be fired just because of who they are? There is no clear rationale as to why these legal protections should extend to people under the age of 18 yet teachers and staff can be fired or not hired.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from experts and members of the community during this inquiry about the effect that these exemptions have on the mental health of LGBTQ+ students and teachers, who already face poorer health outcomes than the broader community. Every day that we delay removing discrimination, those poor mental health outcomes continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, just today, 46 principals of faith based schools across the country have written to the Prime Minister adding their voice, calling for the ability for religious schools to discriminate against LGBTIQ+ students, teachers, staff and families to be removed. Two of the principals of these schools, the principals of Overnewton college and Carey, were people who gave very moving evidence to the inquiry about how they felt that discrimination against people on the basis of their sexuality or their gender identity had no place in their faith based schools. Some of the things they wrote include:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our shared religious ethos and values define the nature of our communities, and those same values call us to welcome families, however they are formed and whatever they look like.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend these 46 schools for making this public statement and for ensuring that their schools and school communities are safe places for all LGBTQ+ people. These principals understand that schools should be discrimination-free zones and that continuing discrimination in our schools is out of step with modern Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Australians voted overwhelmingly for equality, not more discrimination. Recently, a survey conducted after the Ruddock report was leaked found that 74 per cent of Australians believe that we should protect LGBTQ+ people in schools. Of course, this happened when the heat was on during the Wentworth by-election, and soon enough both the Labor Party and the Liberal government had promised the Australian people that they would remove discrimination in schools within a fortnight. That time has come and gone. Labor and the Liberals need to stop delaying this important reform and act on the promise given to Australians to remove discrimination against all same-sex attracted and gender diverse students, teachers and staff in our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the protection of freedom of religion, yes, let's move on establishing a charter of rights so that we can include protecting religious freedom in our human rights framework. Let's act on that. Let's do that. That's how we can balance religious freedom versus discrimination. But with regard to the very simple issue before us today, which this report is considering—removing discrimination against students, teachers and other staff—we need to move on that urgently. We cannot wait for the political support for a charter of rights. We need to catch up with countries like us all around the world where such discrimination is not allowed. We should have no more delays, no more excuses, no more ifs and no more buts. We need to remove discrimination from our schools now.</span>

Nevertheless, it has exposed a truth, and that is that, when students enrolled at religious schools face these challenges, they are dealt with compassionately, pastorally and in a way that respects the best interests of each child.</span>

The last 38 years of operation of the Ranger Uranium Mine cannot compare to the 65,000 years that the Mirarr people have cared for their country. It is vitally important that the legacy and impact of the uranium mine should not be seen as the ongoing responsibility of the traditional owners in this recognition of their rights. It is the responsibility of the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth government to acknowledge the issues that the rightful owners now face and work in partnership to restore the health and environment of Jabiru and its surroundings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Jabiru a couple of weeks ago and had the opportunity to address the full council of the Northern Land Council and to visit the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation. There is a vibrancy in the discussions around the future of the park and the return of the town of Jabiru to the Mirarr. That's taking place, and it's good to see. I wish that those discussions come to fruition very quickly and that any impediments are resolved in a gracious manner. The delays in getting these lands back, getting the determination settled and then getting the lands leased back to the national park in some cases have taken over 30 years, and it's now time for all parties to build a shared future in which the traditional owners can truly benefit in their own right. I ask the minister, in the ongoing quest for bipartisanship, to get behind the Mirarr people and their efforts to rebuild their future on their own lands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I wish to extend my congratulations to all involved in settling the claims on the basis on which they have agreed: the Commonwealth government; the board and directors of the Kakadu National Park; the Northern Territory government; the various traditional owners and their corporations; and the chairman and the board of directors of the Northern Land Council and its staff, especially the CEO, Mr Joe Morrison.</span>

These amendments are welcome as they will see a resolution to several longstanding land claims within Kakadu National Park. Under these charges, the relevant areas will finally be recognised as Aboriginal land and leased to the Director of National Parks, as is the case with the rest of Kakadu. As with all of Kakadu and all the jointly managed national parks, it is incumbent on the Director of National Parks to work with traditional owners to jointly manage the park in a collaborative and meaningful way. These amendments provide an ideal opportunity to review and address some of the historic bureaucratic joint management processes—which I understand have caused some little tension—to help to resolve some of these issues and to more actively encourage and properly consult with traditional owners over management initiatives. The Greens will be supporting these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:18</span>):  The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2017 adds areas subject to the traditional land claims in the Kakadu region in the Northern Territory to schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976—the land rights act—so that the Kakadu land can be granted as Aboriginal land. The bill also provides for the leaseback of the same area of land to the Director of National Parks. The bill also adds areas in the town of Urapunga that are subject to the Township of Urapunga Indigenous Land Use Agreement to schedule 1 of the land rights act so that the Urapunga land can be granted as Aboriginal land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rightful return of these parcels of land to the traditional Aboriginal owners in the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory and in the Roper region in the Gulf of Carpentaria is so many years overdue. It's important to explicitly acknowledge in this place the long battle of traditional owners of this land to have their property rights recognised. First, in relation to the grant of Aboriginal land at Kakadu, I note that 3 November this year was the 40th anniversary of the signing of the lease for stage 1 of Kakadu National Park—the very first national park in Australia and an area of outstanding natural beauty and cultural and heritage values. The regulatory framework for stage 1 of Kakadu National Park was entirely novel in 1978. It involved the grant of Aboriginal land to traditional owners under the newly enacted NT Land Rights Act and the immediate leaseback of that land by those traditional owners to the Director of National Parks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This model was revolutionary and has been utilised in many national parks in the decades since to underpin the joint management of parks and reserves throughout Australia. The outstanding ecological significance of Kakadu National Park is now recognised internationally, and it's inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list of cultural and natural outstanding values. Since that first lease was granted back in 1978, Kakadu National Park has been declared in stages. Stage 2 of the park was declared in 1984, and stage 3 was declared progressively in 1987, 1989 and 1991. Back in 1978, when then chairman of the Northern Land Council, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, signed the first lease for Kakadu National Park, no-one could have foreseen that it would take another 40 years for the outstanding traditional land claims within Kakadu National Park to be resolved so that the underlying tenure of much of the park could be returned to Aboriginal ownership. The scheduling of these parcels of land by this legislation is thus significant in the history of one of Australia's most spectacular areas, and the long-overdue return of these lands to traditional ownership will ensure that the joint management of one of Australia's icons can be enhanced into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the township of Urapunga does not hold quite the same place in the Australian national consciousness as Kakadu, the history of traditional owners' fights to have their rights over this land recognised is also significant. Urapunga is a tiny and tight-knit community about half an hour's drive from Ngukurr in the Gulf region of the Territory, between the banks of the Wilton and Roper rivers. In a strange quirk of Northern Territory history, Urapunga was gazetted as a town by the Northern Territory government in 1887. However, no development took place there. As anthropologist Howard Murphy has written:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the township of Urapunga was to have as little impact on the land as a game of monopoly has on land values in Mayfair. The township of Urapunga was drawn up in abstract at a distance, divided into the grid system favoured in the planning of colonial cities, a miniature version of Melbourne and Adelaide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the town remained mythical, the act of gazetting it back in 1887 had distinct legal consequences. Specifically, the land in towns could not be claimed under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, and this resulted in Urapunga being landlocked by other Aboriginal land, but it could not be claimed itself under that legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the passage of the Native Title Act in 1994, the traditional owners of Urapunga could finally lodge a native title claim over that town, and in 2001 the Federal Court recognised that they had exclusive native title rights over much of this area, except where native title had been extinguished. Following this court decision, the Northern Land Council negotiated with the Northern Territory government to have land in the township of Urapunga scheduled as Aboriginal land under the land rights act. This amending legislation is partly the product of those negotiations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take the opportunity to touch on the issue of the future of the township of Jabiru. The town is located within the borders of Kakadu National Park. The Northern Territory government and the Mirarr traditional owners, through their organisation, the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, have been working on a blueprint for the future of Jabiru for some time. Jabiru's future has been a concern for its residents and those who live and work in the World Heritage listed park due to its legislated closure as part of the shutdown of the Ranger uranium mine in 2021. The Gundjeihmi and NT government have a vision of turning Jabiru into a nationally and internationally recognised tourism destination. The Gundjeihmi-government masterplan proposes a mix of public and private spending on tourism and infrastructure projects for both Jabiru and Kakadu, including a new World Heritage interpretive centre and education precinct; a resource centre; new accommodation offerings, including a wellness centre, an eco-recreation hub, and a five-star lodge—with glamping, Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan; I know that interests you. The NT government has pledged to keep essential health and educational services in the town for another five years. The plan to bring new development to Jabiru and Kakadu will not only breathe life into the town and park; it will also bring significant benefit to the wider Northern Territory, stimulating tourist visitation, creating local jobs and strengthening the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate all involved in the scheduling of this land as Aboriginal land. In particular I recognise the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land in both the Kakadu region and in the township of Urapunga for their patience and perseverance in realising their aspirations to have this land returned to their ownership.</span>

The bill amends legislation and repeals redundant legislation. The amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 will enable the finalisation of five longstanding Aboriginal land claims and a native title settlement in the Northern Territory. The bill adds areas subject to four traditional land claims in the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory to schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the land rights act, so that the land can be granted as Aboriginal land. It also provides for the leaseback of that land to the Director of National Parks and the repeal of provisions of the land rights act made redundant by the bill. The bill also adds land that was subject to a successful native title application in the Roper River region of the Northern Territory to schedule 1 of the land rights act so that the land can be granted as Aboriginal land. Scheduling of the land is consistent with the terms of the township of Urapunga Indigenous land use agreement executed by the native title parties and the Northern Territory government. In addition, the bill adds land that is associated with the settlement of the Anthony Lagoon area land claim to schedule 1 of the land rights act so that the land can be granted as Aboriginal land. Scheduling of the land is consistent with the terms of the Anthony Lagoon area land claim No. 74 deed of settlement executed by the parties associated with the land claim and the Northern Territory government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would like to thank the Northern Land Council for the work it has undertaken in consulting with traditional owners and other stakeholders. The government made clear our commitment to prioritise efforts to resolve outstanding land claims at the last election. We have provided additional resources for the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, land councils and other stakeholders to support this, delivering on the coalition government's commitment to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to ensure Indigenous land rights deliver the economic opportunities that should come from owning your own land. We understand that this must be the priority. It is why we are working with traditional owners of township leases held by communities for community driven economic development, like the Gumatj-held township lease at Gunyangara. It is why we are investing record amounts in support for land tenure reforms, including as part of our commitment to develop northern Australia and it is why we are backing Indigenous businesses through our $90 million Indigenous Entrepreneurs Fund and a successful Community Development Program which has delivered more than 28,000 jobs in remote areas. We have given the processing of land claims the priority it deserves and we will continue to fight for the rights of Indigenous Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:34</span>):  I rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 on behalf of the opposition. I would like to say at the outset that Labor supports this bill. We are determined that our national security arrangements stay ahead of our security circumstances to make sure Australians stay safe and the freedoms that make our society what it is are protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents part of the measures announced by the government last year to improve the support the ADF can provide for national counterterrorism efforts. Some of these measures have already been put in place by the Department of Defence, giving more practical support for the state and territory law enforcement agencies, including an enhanced counterterrorism liaison network, an enhanced program with training activities and streamlined police access to Defence facilities, such as rangers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The administrative changes to call-out powers in this bill is another aspect that brings last year's announcement into full effect. There are two types of call-out orders under the current Defence Act 1903: an order for the ADF to be called out immediately; or a contingent call-out order, whereby the ADF can be called out if specified circumstances arise. This bill amends the Defence Act to: make it easier for states and territories to request ADF support; simplify, expand and clarify the ADF's powers; enhance the ADF's ability to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction, or across jurisdictions; and allow for pre-authorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land, at sea and in the air, typically used as part of measures during major events such as the G20 or Commonwealth Games. This change will not change the role of state and territory police forces as the first responders to terrorist incidents. Consideration of a call-out will still only occur once a state or territory has made a request. Call-out of the ADF for the protection of Commonwealth interests may be initiated by the Commonwealth or be requested by a state or territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum contains four principles behind the changes. The four principles are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• The ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• If the ADF is called out, civilian authorities remain paramount, but ADF members remain under military command.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• When called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in all the circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are five amendments included in this bill, making it easier for states and territories to request ADF support. The Defence Act, as it stands, prevents the ADF from being called out until the states and territories are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence. This provision effectively means a state or territory will have had to exhaust its law enforcement resources before requesting the assistance of the ADF. This bill provides a more flexible threshold to response. Ministers of the Commonwealth will need to consider (1) the nature of the violence or threat and (2) whether calling out the ADF would be likely to enhance the state's or territory's ability to respond to the threat. These new provisions respect the states and territories role as first responders but gives flexibility for the most rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support in responding to terrorist incidents to be provided by the ADF, simplifying, expanding and clarifying the ADF's powers. The bill specifies, expands and clarifies the ADF's existing search and seizure powers when they're operating under a call-out order. Currently, the ADF search powers do not authorise them to search for and detain people as they focus on dangerous things. This amendment will permit ADF personnel to be authorised to search for and seize items and search for and detain people that are likely to pose a threat to a person's life, health or safety, or to public health or safety generally. These changes provide ADF personnel search and seizure powers that complement and assist state and territory law enforcement powers, crucial for working in collaboration with state and territory police officers under a call-out order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note the explanatory memorandum makes clear the amendments ensure ADF personnel can only detain a person whom it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to detain. For instance, it would not generally be necessary as a matter of urgency for the ADF to detain a person where police are also present.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains an amendment to allow the ADF to be pre-authorised to respond to threats on land, at sea and in the air. Pre-authorised or contingent call-out will allow ministers to pre-authorise the ADF to respond if specific circumstances arise. Today, contingent call-out is limited to protecting Commonwealth interests from air threats. This type of call-out has been put in place regularly to protect major Commonwealth events—the G20, the ASEAN summit and the Commonwealth Games. The bill extends contingent call-out to be available for state and territory interests from threats in the land, air and maritime domains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an understandable desire to limit potential delays if a threat is imminent or has just occurred. This amendment removes the potential for delay in seeking ministerial authorisation for ADF support and provides extra options in planning support for future major events. The bill makes important improvements to the ADF's ability to respond to multiple incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction or which cross jurisdictional boundaries, including offshore. Finally, the bill also contains a number of provisions in support of the amendments I have outlined, including increased requirements for the ADF to consult with state and territory police where it is operating in their jurisdictions, and adding the Minister for Home Affairs as a named alternative authorising minister for expediting call-out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into this bill. Its report was tabled on 3 September this year. The recommendation of that inquiry was that the bill be passed. The committee further recommended that the government consider including clear definitions of 'specified circumstances' in the legislation itself or in the explanatory memorandum. This demonstrates the value of the committee's process, in which a bill can be examined and recommendations made for improvement. I acknowledge that the government accepts the committee's recommendation. The government tabled an amended explanatory memorandum which provides explanation of the term in the context of contingent call-out powers. The opposition thanks the government for its positive consideration of the recommendations of the committee and for this action in response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, under a contingent call-out order the Commonwealth pre-authorises the ADF to be called out if 'specified circumstances' arise. The revised explanatory memorandum now states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not intended that contingent call out orders … will be made on the basis of vague or indefinite specified circumstances. The specified circumstances must be sufficiently particular to allow authorising Ministers to make the assessments required—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">to satisfy themselves that the domestic violence or a threat in the offshore area is likely and would be resolved by the call-out of the ADF. For example, the new explanatory memorandum states:</span>

Commonwealth interests requiring protection in these circumstances could include Commonwealth property, and visiting dignitaries or heads of state. A foreseeable risk may be a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack at the summit venue. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for a contingent call out order to be in place to deal with this foreseeable risk, empowering the ADF to use its specialist capabilities should the specified circumstances of an imminent or actual CBRN attack at the summit arise.</span>

The amendments to the explanatory memorandum also make it clear that the amended criteria that ministers will be required to consider in making a call-out order recognise that calling out the ADF to respond to an incident is a significant and exceptional act and ensure that it is not to be done in relation to incidents that are within the ordinary capabilities of police.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to note that Labor has approached this bill with an intention to work in a bipartisan way towards the national interest. That is the only proper way to work through issues like these. I recognise that there are senators who have concerns about this bill and who do not believe it should be enacted in its current form. I further recognise that those views are held in good faith. I will end where I began by stating that Labor supports this bill as a small but important change to an existing power as part of broader changes to improve the support the ADF can provide state and territory police forces under our national counter-terrorism arrangements. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:45</span>):  The Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 deals with a very serious matter: the potential use of the Australian Defence Force to deal with incidents of terrorism and violence on Australian territory. The use of armed forces in a domestic security context is something that must be problematic for any liberal democracy. It should never be undertaken lightly. It should only be considered in response to confirmed security threats of a particularly serious nature. It should never be done for political advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Call-outs of the ADF in response to threats of domestic violence and terrorism have been very rare. The Australian Army was called out to deal with civil disturbances in the then Australian trust territory of Papua New Guinea in 1970 and 1971, and the Army was briefly deployed in response to an apparent terrorist threat to the Commonwealth heads of government retreat at Bowral in 1978. The ADF has been put in a state of readiness to provide security support for a range of events—for example, the Sydney Olympics in 2000, the 2007 APEC meetings and the Brisbane G20 meeting. Fortunately those events passed without incident. So far we've been lucky that in recent times no government has faced circumstances where ministers and governors-general have been required to authorise the deployment of the Army on Australian streets. The threat of terrorism is significant, but, as the tragic incident in Melbourne this month shows, thanks to the work of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and federal and state police the individuals that were involved in that particular event were isolated, and it was dealt with by those civilian and security authorities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contingencies in which the ADF might be required will hopefully remain less likely, though of course there are possibilities and we must address those possibilities. According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill will amend part IIIAAA of the Defence Act 1903 in order to streamline the legal procedures for call-out of the ADF and to enhance the ability of the ADF to protect states, self-governing territories and Commonwealth interests, onshore and offshore, against domestic violence, including terrorism. In effect, the bill lowers the threshold for calling out the ADF so that the ADF will no longer be an instrument of last resort in dealing with terrorism or domestic violence, but will instead be available if the ADF capabilities are considered valuable to supplement and support civilian police capabilities in dealing with an incident. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for streamlined call-out arrangements has been highlighted in a number of security reviews and inquiries. In particular, the state coroner of New South Wales, in its inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege, found that existing arrangements for the ADF call-out in relation to terrorist incidents were inadequate. The bill's amendments will make it easy for the states and territories to request ADF support by removing the threshold requirement that the states and territories are not or are unlikely to be able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence. However, authorising ministers, when deciding whether the ADF should be called out, will need to consider the nature of the violence and whether the ADF would be likely to enhance the state and territory response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Among other things, this bill will also expand contingent call-out arrangements to allow the ADF to pre-authorise to respond to land and maritime threats, in addition to existing provisions of contingent call-out in relation to aviation threats, and provide for contingent call-outs for the protection of states and territories. Call-out of the ADF for the protection of states and territories will only be able to be considered following a request by a state or territory. Call-out of the ADF for the protection of Commonwealth interests may be initiated by the Commonwealth itself or requested by a state or territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum outlines four principles that underpin the proposed changes in the bill. Those four principles are: (1) the ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities; (2) if the ADF is called out, the civilian power remains paramount but ADF members remain under military command; (3) if the ADF is called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances; and (4) ADF personnel remain subject to law and are accountable for their actions. The state and territory police forces will continue to be the first responders to terrorist incidents. These forces are highly capable and best placed to respond at short notice to terrorist attacks or threats. Against this background, I want to focus on several aspects of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of these is the threshold for call-out. As I've mentioned, the current threshold for call-out requires the authorising minister to be satisfied that a state or territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect itself or Commonwealth interests from domestic violence. This current threshold means that the Commonwealth could not call out the ADF where the Commonwealth assesses that a state or territory has both the capability and capacity to resolve the incident. The affected state or territory would need to exhaust all other options, including support from other jurisdictions, before making a request for assistance from the Commonwealth. So this threshold is not optimal for facilitating ADF involvement to complement or augment a civilian law enforcement response to a terrorist incident. Certainly, some specialist ADF capabilities, especially special operation forces and some surveillance capabilities as well as nuclear, biological and chemical defence assets, could be of value early in the development of a major terrorist incident. The threshold adopted in this bill does appear appropriate and balanced to ensure that these resources can be made available quickly if they are required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue I wish to discuss is the pre-authorisation of the ADF to respond to threats on land and at sea as well as in the air. Pre-authorised or contingent call-out will allow ministers to pre-authorise the ADF to respond if specific circumstances arise. At present, contingent call-out is currently limited to the protection of Commonwealth interests from air threats alone, as Senator Polley alluded to. The bill will extend contingent call-out to be available for the protection of both Commonwealth interests and state and territory interests from threats in the land, air and maritime domains. This reflects a greater conception of the range of possible terrorist threats. The purpose of this amendment is to remove potential delays in seeking ministerial authorisation for ADF support once a threat is considered imminent or immediately after the event occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures make sense, but they will still need to be exercised with caution and restraint. While a contingent call-out may be authorised in relation to a planned event, it's quite likely that this sort of incident or action may be triggered by an intelligence warning of a threat. Intelligence, as we know, can often be ambiguous, and false alarms are not unknown. Politics, rather than objective assessment of danger, can also play a part. We should not be naive about this and assume that these decisions will always be made objectively and with political disinterest. Ordering and indeed announcing a contingent call-out may prove a temptation for a government that might want to play up a security threat for political purposes. I note I saw Minister Dutton doing something very similar over the last few days in relation to encryption, calling on the incident in Victoria last week and using it to try and press a political outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the Defence Act requires that the government report to parliament following a call-out of the ADF, it is far from clear how scrutiny would be subsequently applied to the responsible minister. With the parliament's intelligence oversight committee, the PJCIS, explicitly excluded from reviewing intelligence operations assessments or performance, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for any member of parliament outside the executive to examine the information and decision-making leading to a decision to put troops on the street. At this point I advise that I will perhaps seek some answers to that in the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This consideration leads to another issue: the role of the Governor-General. Under the Defence Act it is the Governor-General who issues the order to call out the ADF. By convention, the Governor-General will act on the advice of the Prime Minister or other authorising ministers designated in the Defence Act. Although the Governor-General must follow the advice of ministers, the Governor-General is free—and indeed duty bound—to satisfy him- or herself that the advice is well founded. Although the circumstances may require urgent action, the Governor-General must be able to ask questions and seek information or clarification. In the case of a contingent call-out, there would presumably be time for a full and comprehensive briefing for the Governor-General before orders were issued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of record that, in the years following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, national counterterrorism exercises in this country—the Mercury exercise series—from time to time included the participation of Governor-Generals, or the official secretaries to Governor-Generals as a substitute, to rehearse procedures relating to the call-out of the ADF. This was a desirable practice, as it afforded the Governor-General and his or her staff the opportunity to familiar themselves with issues and procedures that might have to be dealt with unexpectedly and in great haste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to questions during Senate estimates earlier this year, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the official secretary to the Governor-General advised that the current Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, or his office have not participated in national counterterrorism exercises. Indeed, there appears to be very little engagement with Government House on these matters at all. The official secretary acknowledged that he had some relevant papers tucked away in his office safe, but that was about it. Of course, Sir Peter, as the former Chief of the Army and Chief of the Defence Force, is well versed in the provisions of the Defence Act. However, Sir Peter's successor as Governor-General may not be so familiar with these issues. The same goes for any state governor who, in the absence of the Governor-General, is serving as administrator of the Commonwealth. Once again, I will ask some questions about this in the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, there would be some merit in ensuring that future Governor-Generals and their official secretaries are fully briefed on the legislation and procedures relating to the call-out of the ADF and are able to participate in exercises as appropriate. A Governor-General who is familiar with these matters will be better able to ask the right questions and require the appropriate level of information and briefing before endorsing a request from the Prime Minister or other ministers for him or her to order a call-out of the ADF. On this very important matter, no-one should think that the Governor-General is a rubber stamp.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I note that the bill also introduces the Minister for Home Affairs as a named alternative minister for the purpose of call-out. Under the existing legislation, in a sudden and extraordinary emergency, an expedited call-out is made by the Prime Minister acting alone or, if the Prime Minister is unable to be contacted, the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General acting together. If only one of the authorising ministers can be contacted, an expedited call-out order can be made by either the Minister for Defence or the Attorney-General, together with an alternate minister, which could include the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognition of the role that the Minister for Home Affairs plays in counterterrorism coordination and as a member of the National Security Committee of cabinet, the bill adds the Minister for Home Affairs as a named alternative minister for the purpose of expedited call-out. This change appropriately reflects the importance of the new Home Affairs portfolio. I would also observe, however, that it is appropriate that, while the Minister for Home Affairs will be the alternative minister, there is no change to the requirement that at least one of the Prime Minister, the defence minister and the Attorney-General must be involved in the authorisation of a call-out order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has the support of the coalition government and, of course, the Labor opposition, as Senator Polley has outlined. It has been considered by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which in September recommended that the bill be passed, albeit with a recommendation that the government provide clear definitions of the so-called specified circumstances for the purposes of making a call-out of the ADF. That clarification was provided through the explanatory memorandum during the course of debate in the House of Representatives and appears satisfactory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the debate in the House of Representatives, a number of members were quite effusive in their praise for this legislation. They were, one would have to say, almost enthusiastic at the prospect that elements of the ADF might, at some future time, be deployed against a terrorist threat in Australia. More than a few members of this parliament are very eager to present themselves as being tough on terrorism and critically back any and all measures they think are supportive of that. As a former member of the Australian Defence Force, I have no doubt about the impressive capabilities and professionalism that our Defence Force can bring to bear, but no-one should be particularly enthusiastic about that prospect. If the provisions contained in the bill are ever evoked and the ADF is called out into Australian streets in response to a terrorist threat or other domestic violence, it will most likely mark an intelligence, security and policy failure. It will mean that a situation has developed that is so serious that the ADF is needed to bring it to its successful resolution. It will always be preferable that circumstances never reach that point. This bill is necessary, but it shouldn't detract from a very clear focus on civilian, security and policing measures to ensure that the deployment of the ADF is not required. We should all hope and work for that. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:02</span>):  I rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. As the shadow minister for defence, Mr Marles indicated in his speech in the second reading debate that Labor will be supporting this bill. In doing so, we are following the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which conducted an inquiry into the bill and tabled its report on 3 September. It's a sobering experience to debate a bill of this kind following the terrorist incident which occurred in Melbourne in the last few weeks. We've now had a number of such incidents on Australian soil in which six Australians, not counting the perpetrators, have been killed. Although this number is very low compared to those experienced in Britain, France or Germany, every such incident comes as a profound shock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the world's most successful multicultural and multifaith societies. I have great faith in pluralistic societies. I think they are the best types of societies. Over the last 70 years, we have welcomed more than seven million immigrants to this country. Close to a million people have come as refugees fleeing poverty, war and persecution in their home countries. The overwhelming majority of these immigrants and refugees, wherever they came from and whatever religion they profess, have successfully integrated into Australian society and have become useful and productive citizens. Australia would not be the wonderful place it is today without their contribution to our society. But that is why we find it so shocking and distressing that even a very small number of people who come here as refugees should fall under the sway of radical religious ideology and make such murderous attacks on their fellow Australians, such as we saw at the Martin Place siege in 2014, the shooting at Parramatta Police Station in 2015 and the recent incident in the Bourke Street Mall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to and support for the men and women of our federal, state and territory police forces and of our security and intelligence services. Between them, as we know, they have detected and prevented a number of potentially serious terrorist plans before those plans have come to fruition. As we saw in Melbourne recently, they are frequently called on to put their lives at risk to protect the safety of the public, and they do so unflinchingly. We should remember to always be grateful to the men and women of those services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge that, in most of these cases, terrorist plans are detected early and terrorist attacks are prevented because of the willingness of the leaders of our communities and the great majority of people from those communities to cooperate with the police and the intelligence services. No-one suffers more when one of those attacks takes place than the community from which the perpetrators come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the vigilance of our police and security service and the co-operation of our communities, Australia has so far been spared the kind of large-scale terrorist attack that we have seen with tragic frequency in Europe, the Middle East and other parts of the world. But we cannot be complacent. We need to recognise that the danger of such an attack is always with us. We cannot know where or when such an attack might occur or how serious such an attack might be, nor can we be certain that our police services will be able to cope with such an attack, even though all states and territories have increased their expenditure on hardening their police services so that they can respond quickly and appropriately to any kind of terrorist incident.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ultimate guarantor of the security of Australia and the safety of the Australian people is the Australian Defence Force. This has always been recognised. Section 199 of the Constitution says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Act, first passed by the parliament in 1903, has always contained provisions for the ADF to be called out in support of the civil authorities in an emergency. Section 51 of the act allows the ADF to be called out by the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Minister for Defence. One of the grounds on which the ADF may be called out is:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to clarify the circumstances in which the ADF can be called out to assist a state or territory to cope with an incident of domestic violence on its territory. Although the term 'domestic violence' in the Constitution and the Defence Act was originally intended to refer to events such as riots and civil conflict, it is obvious that a terrorist attack on Australian soil, whether launched from inside or outside Australia, would fall under this heading. If this is a matter that needs clarification, the addendum to the explanatory memorandum to this bill states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The term 'domestic violence' … refers to conduct that is marked by great physical force and would include a terrorist attack, hostage situation, and widespread or significant violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the act was not written with terrorist attacks in mind, and some of its provisions need to be clarified and strengthened so that the ADF can react promptly and, most importantly, within the law when it is called on to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 51A of the Defence Act specifies the circumstances in which the ADF can be called out to assist a state or territory if:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Ministers are satisfied that … if the domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur in a State or self-governing Territory—the State or Territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the act stipulates that the ADF can only be called if the Minister for Defence believes that the state or territory authorities are unable to cope with the situation that has arisen. Clearly, in the current circumstances, that is an unrealistically restrictive provision. Its effect is to say that a state or territory must have exhausted its law enforcement resources before the Minister for Defence can agree to a request from the state or territory for the assistance of the ADF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill provide a more flexible provision. It requires the Minister for Defence to consider, firstly, the nature of the violence or threat; and, secondly, whether the calling out of the ADF would be likely to enhance the ability of the state or territory to respond to that threat. The effect of this provision would be to allow greater flexibility for the ADF to provide at the request of a state or territory the most rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support in responding to terrorist incidents while, at the same time, respecting the position of the states and territories as the first responders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Act, as it currently stands, outlines two basic types of call-out orders: an order for the ADF to be called out immediately; and a contingent call-out order whereby the ADF can be called out if specified circumstances arise. This bill amends the Defence Act for four purposes: first, to make it easier for states and territories to request ADF support; secondly, to simplify, expand and clarify the ADF's powers; thirdly, to enhance the ADF's ability to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction or across jurisdictions; and, fourthly, to allow for pre-authorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land and sea as well as in the air typically used as part of the measures during major events such as the G20 or the Commonwealth Games. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that, following implementation of these changes, the state and territory police forces will continue to be the first responders to terrorist incidents, and call-out of the Australian Defence Force for the protection of states and territories will only be able to be considered following a request by the state or territory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Call-out of the ADF for the protection of Commonwealth interests may be initiated by the Commonwealth itself or requested by a state or territory. To this end, the explanatory memorandum outlines four principles that underpin the proposed changes in this bill. The four principles are: firstly, the ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities; secondly, if the ADF is called out the civilian power remains paramount, but ADF members remain under military command; thirdly, if the ADF is called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances; and, fourthly, ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concern may be felt that the provision for a contingent call-out order may be abused—that is, an order whereby the ADF can be called out for specified circumstances where they arise but before these circumstances have arisen. Senator Patrick alluded to a concern that such a provision could be abused for perhaps political purposes. In response to these concerns, the explanatory memorandum now states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not intended that contingent call out orders under proposed section 34 will be made on the basis of vague or indefinite specified circumstances. The specified circumstances must be sufficiently particular to allow authorising Ministers to make the assessments required—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">in order to satisfy themselves that the domestic violence or threat is likely and that the call-out of the ADF would resolve the incident. Further:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, a contingent call out order could be made to protect Commonwealth interests during a major international summit. Commonwealth interests requiring protection in these circumstances could include Commonwealth property, and visiting dignitaries or heads of state. A foreseeable risk may be a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack at the summit venue. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for a contingent call out order to be in place to deal with this foreseeable risk, empowering the ADF to use its specialist capabilities should the specified circumstances of an imminent or actual CBRN attack at the summit arise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum also makes it clear that the amended criteria that the Minister for Defence will be required to consider in making a call-out order stipulate that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… calling out the ADF to respond to an incident is a significant and exceptional act and ensures that it is not done in relation to incidents that are within the ordinary capability of the police. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The act, as amended, thus precludes any possibility, no matter how remote, that a state or territory government could call on a Minister for Defence to call out the ADF without good cause or for any cause other than a serious emergency. Taken together, these are important safeguards against the unlikely circumstance that a Minister for Defence would seek to use these powers in an improper way. I'm pleased that the government has listened to some of the concerns initially expressed about some provisions of this bill and has clarified them in such a way as to satisfy any reasonable concerns. It is on this basis that the opposition has decided to support this bill as a necessary, carefully calibrated response to the heightened level of threat that we sadly find ourselves facing. I commend this bill to the Senate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:15</span>):  The Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 deals with an incredibly serious circumstance, where Australian Defence Force personnel may be called out on Australian soil, potentially deployed against Australian citizens, with the capacity to use lethal force against Australian people. It significantly lowers the threshold for such a call-out to be made. Any time you're talking about setting the Army, Navy or Air Force loose on Australian citizens, you had better have a pretty watertight piece of legislation to govern it. Unfortunately, that is not what the Senate is being provided with this evening. This legislation has loopholes you could drive a proverbial tank through. The Australian Greens will not be supporting it in its current form. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2000 and again in 2006 legislation was introduced that did give the Commonwealth government peacetime powers to call out Defence personnel if 'domestic violence is occurring or likely to occur that will be likely to affect the Commonwealth interests or require the protection of a state or territory.' The Sydney Olympic Games were the initial rationale for the 2000 legislation, and the 2006 amendments changed the legislative requirements under which the ADF could be called out in anticipation of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that this bill is a result of a review of Defence support to national counterterrorism arrangements, and we are well aware that the New South Wales coroner, in his report of the inquest into the deaths arriving from the Lindt Cafe siege, wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Commonwealth informed the inquest that it had begun a "comprehensive review" of the support at the ADF provides to domestic counter-terrorism operations. The review was said to touch on the legislative and policy framework for call out, as well as ADF capabilities in the current threat environment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that that report and its recommendations have not been made available publicly, as far as we are aware. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today amends part IIIAAA of the Defence Act 1903 to streamline the legal procedures for call-out of the ADF. As I said a moment ago, it significantly lowers the threshold for such a call-out to be made. Currently there are a number of preconditions to the Australian Defence Force being called out in response to domestic violence in Australia. I'm going to come back to domestic violence in more detail later in my speech, but I will note that it is not defined anywhere in this legislation. Nowhere is domestic violence defined. At the moment the preconditions include this: that the state or territory is not or is unlikely to be able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence. That is section 51A of the Defence Act 1903. This bill proposes to amend part IIIAAA of the Defence Act to expand the circumstances in which the ADF may be called out in response to domestic violence—whatever that might mean—in Australia under two types of orders. I'm going to go first to the state or territory call-out order here. Remember, currently, before a call-out order is made the minister must be satisfied that the state or territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, the Governor-General may make a state or territory call-out order if a state or territory government applies to the Commonwealth government to protect the state or territory against domestic violence—whatever that means—that is occurring, or is likely to occur, in the state or territory. The powers of the ADF, set out in one or more of divisions 3, 4 and/or 5 of the bill, should apply—and that is gone into in more detail—and the authorising ministers must be satisfied that the ADF should be called out to protect the state or territory against domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out that it's actually the job of our police forces to maintain law and order in this country. That is why we have them. That's why we have Tasmania Police and all of the other state and territory police force. It's why we have the Federal Police, the AFP. It's their job to maintain law and order and address violent situations that, all too tragically, do arise from time to time in our country. It's not the job we constituted our Army for—or our Navy or our Air Force. Neil James of the Australian Defence Association said: 'The whole concept of this goes back centuries. Back in the days when they didn't have police forces, governments used to call on the military to do things that the police do now.' Well, we do have police forces now—state and federal police forces—that are very well resourced and very well trained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out that the terrorism threat level in this country has not increased for years. Yet we get this series of pieces of legislation that seek to do everything from eroding the fundamental rights and liberties that we use to send Australians overseas to fight and die to protect to now having a bill that significantly lowers the threshold to put the Army onto the streets and potentially deploy lethal force against Australian citizens. This is a most serious piece of legislation, and it's not good enough that the term 'domestic violence' is nowhere defined in either this bill or in the substantive act. This takes us from the situation we currently have where a state or territory is not able to protect Commonwealth interests against domestic violence, or is unlikely to be able to protect Commonwealth interests against domestic violence, to what's in this bill, where there is no requirement that a state or territory be unable to protect Commonwealth interests against domestic violence; there simply needs to be domestic violence that is likely to affect Commonwealth interests. This will make it much, much easier for the ADF to be called out in this country and potentially deploy lethal force against Australian citizens on the basis of a completely undefined term, 'domestic violence'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, you are referring me to the Constitution. I know that term is used in section 119 of the Constitution, but it's worth pointing out that it is not defined there either. You have also had a crack at defining it in your explanatory memorandum. If it's good enough for the EM, it's good enough to be included in the legislation—because time after time we see powers created and then, a little bit down the track, a government will come along and abuse those powers unless the legislation prevents them from doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you one example that I'm aware of in recent times. This is the metadata retention laws, where—disgracefully and shamefully—police can, without a warrant, access someone's metadata. When the Australian people were sold this absolute pup by the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, who both, shamefully, supported it, it was all about counterterrorism, but—you know what?—we've seen examples of local governments using metadata to track down someone who's got an unregistered dog! That's what the metadata laws are being used for now. They were brought in under the guise of counterterrorism; now they're being used to figure out whether people have got registered dogs or not. That's what I call bracket creep—and, mark my words, bracket creep is what we will see if this bill is passed unamended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, in effect, the bill changes the legislative threshold from one where the state or territory has to be unable or unlikely to be able to protect itself or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence to one where ADF support would be likely to enhance the state or territory's ability to protect itself or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence—again, a term undefined in this legislation. That is a significant lowering of the threshold and one that the Greens are extremely concerned about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do acknowledge that some improvement has been made to this bill through the recommendations of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which will result in a clearer definition of some of the terms used in this legislation. But the Australian Greens are going to propose a second reading amendment to this legislation that would do two things. Firstly, it would make it very clear that the Senate is of the opinion that call-out orders should be disallowable instruments—that is, the parliament would have the capacity to override the call-out. This goes back to a fundamental of the Australian Greens: we should not be able to be sent to war with another country without parliamentary approval first, because parliament, not the executive, is sovereign in this country. The executive flows from the parliament, not the other way around. As ministers are about to find out in six months when the Australian people unceremoniously boot this rabble out of government, if you've got the numbers on the floor of the House of Representatives, you can make a government and you can be the executive. The executive flows from the parliament in this country, not the other way around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, our second reading amendment would require that parliament would have to sit within six days of any call-out order being made—in other words, parliament would have to be recalled if it wasn't already going to be sitting within those six days from the call-out order being made—and an instrument would have to be tabled in both houses of this parliament so that either house could, on its own decision, override the call-out order. I'll be moving that second reading amendment at the conclusion of my contribution today.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on the record comments that were made during the debate on the 2006 bill in this place by the then Leader of the Australian Greens, a good friend of mine, Senator Bob Brown. He put forward very similar amendments to the two that I have just outlined. Former Senator Brown's argument in support of his very similar amendments is exactly the argument I want to put to the Senate today, so I'm going to quote from Senator Brown's speech in 2006. He said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a democratic safeguard being built in against some future abuse of this power by a Prime Minister, a Treasurer or a Minister for Defence. It is an absolutely important safeguard being brought in here. You can only vote against this safeguard if you do not think the parliament has primacy, and if you think the executive and indeed the Prime Minister, who is not even mentioned in the Constitution, should have primacy in our federation, a century after the Constitution was written. It is a very, very important Greens amendment. It is a safeguard against the abuse of power. I cannot see that there could be any reasonable argument that the parliament should not be brought in in such an extraordinary circumstance as a call-out of the troops by a national executive to prevent some domestic threat arising in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make that same argument to colleagues today. If you're going to vote against our second reading amendment, you'll be voting against the primacy of the parliament and you'll be failing to stand up against the potential future abuse of these powers by a government minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me very neatly to the fact that this bill before us today seeks to include the Minister for Home Affairs as an authorised minister. I mean, this is Mr Peter Dutton we're talking about here—a man who has consistently demonstrated that he cannot be trusted with the significant powers he already has. If you don't believe me, go and have a look at how many times the courts have overruled this minister. It is a regular occurrence in this country that Mr Dutton is overruled, either by the AAT or by another court in this country, because he makes decisions based on a desire to punish innocent people, not on the basis of what is right and proper under law. He has a contempt for the rule of law, and anyone who has a contempt for the rule of law, quite frankly, does not understand the political role it plays as a foundation of our democracy and as a foundation of the freedoms and liberties that so many Australian people enjoy. I cannot comprehend how anybody could think Mr Dutton is an appropriate person to be an authorised minister. He's not the defence minister; he's the Minister for Home Affairs. And they want to step him up so he becomes an authorised minister under this act. Well, I'd love an explanation of why the minister thinks it is necessary to, in effect, give the Minister for Home Affairs a significant boost in the level of authority he is able to exercise in sending the Australian Army out onto the streets to potentially use lethal force against Australian citizens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the term 'domestic violence', in the couple of minutes left to me tonight. It's not defined in this legislation. It's defined in the explanatory memorandum as referring to conduct marked by great physical force. What on earth does 'great physical force' mean? That's not defined either, in the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum. What does 'great physical force' mean, Minister, in this context? And how are any of the relevant ministers, including Mr Dutton, going to interpret 'great physical force'? Or does he or she even have to interpret it—because of course the term 'domestic violence' is not defined in this legislation? The government's excuse in its explanatory memorandum is, 'Oh, that's all fine, because domestic violence is the term used in section 119 of the Constitution, which deals with state requests for assistance in responding to domestic violence.' Again, the term 'domestic violence' is not defined in the Constitution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is at pains to make it clear in the explanatory memorandum that peaceful protests, industrial action or civil disobedience would not fall within the definition of 'domestic violence'. Well, if you're so sure about it, put it in the legislation: define 'domestic violence' and make it clear that it doesn't include peaceful protests, industrial action or civil disobedience. But you haven't. You haven't put it in the legislation, which means that these words are not worth the paper they're printed on.</span>

                    </a>  No, you didn't mention it at all, Senator. But it includes domestic violence as 'conduct that is marked by great physical force and would include a terrorist attack or other mass-casualty incident'. That demonstrates how this would be interpreted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the submitters suggested, amongst other things, that the bill would better enable the ADF to apply its specialist skills and capabilities in responding to incidents of domestic violence, including terrorism. Submitters welcomed the clarity the bill would provide in relation to the use of lethal force; argued in support of the bill's provisions for expansion of the contingent call-out; and noted that the bill would enhance the ADF's ability to respond to incidents across multiple jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes it easier for states and territories to request the ADF's support by removing the threshold requirement that the states and territories are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or the Commonwealth interest against domestic violence. However, authorising ministers will need to take into account the nature of the violence and whether the ADF would be likely to enhance the state or territory response when deciding whether the ADF should be called out. The bill also provides certain other more technical provisions that do, in fact, make the whole powers given to the ADF more understandable. They clarify them and were welcomed by all responsible and relevant parties.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was one concern the committee had, which was mentioned in the committee's report to parliament, and that was that the definition of 'specified circumstances' referred to in the bill was not clear. The committee recommended that the government give consideration to providing clear definitions of 'specified circumstances' in the legislation itself or in the explanatory memorandum for the purposes of making a call-out of the Australian Defence Force. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to say that this is a government which understands and appreciates the work Senate committees do. It understands the submissions made to Senate committees, which are fully assessed by Senate committees, and it responds accordingly. I'm delighted to see that the government has amended its bill to give a better definition of 'specified circumstances', as the majority of the committee requested and as, I think, Senator Polley referred to. I do note in passing that the Greens issued a half-page dissenting report, so I was quite interested to hear Senator McKim's 20-minute dissertation on why the Greens oppose this bill when all they could manage was three-quarters of a page in their dissenting report on the bill. </span>

You just hold your machine guns and your bombs ready until we get parliament to address this and determine whether we should call out the Army, because the police can't deal with it.

There were 16 submitters, including, amongst others, the Centre for Military and Security Law, the Northern Territory Police, the Australian Lawyers Alliance, and the Law Council of Australia. As I say, there were a number of other submitters too. I want to thank them and place on record the committee's appreciation to them for the assistance that they gave the committee. The committee recommended, subject to that specification, which has been met by the government—and I thank the government for that—that the bill be passed, so I therefore support the bill.</span>

First of all, in relation to his questions about the Constitution, I can assure Senator McKim that the Constitution is relevant and that it's not just about the vibe of the Constitution. The definition of 'domestic violence' is real, and it is very clear. While you might dismiss the fact that it is in section 119 of the Constitution, it does define domestic violence and it is very clear. Your recommendation would be unworkable at the very least. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also agree with Senator Macdonald. I've heard a number of ludicrous things coming from some of the Greens senators, but saying to the parliament, 'There's been a terrorist incident. A state or territory government has requested urgent assistance,' and having us say, 'We'll recall parliament, Mr or Mrs Terrorist. Please hold on, and we'll wait for a number of days'—it is unworkable.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. For the benefit of Senator McKim and anybody else who may have been listening to this debate tonight, thinking that domestic violence does not have a good definition, I will explain again that it is in section 119 of the Australian Constitution and it is quite clear about what it means. The term 'domestic violence' refers to violence occurring within Australia. The term is not defined in the legislation but refers to conduct that is marked by great physical force and will include a terrorist attack or a hostage situation. Part IIIAAA uses the term 'domestic violence' as this is a term used in the Constitution. Again, as I said, it's not about the vibe or anything else; it is about the black and white of Australia's Constitution. This section explicitly deals with state requests for assistance in responding to domestic violence in a very clear definition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all of my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to the debate on the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. I also thank the opposition for its support for these important amendments to the legislation. I would reflect that, for all of us here in the parliament and also for the executive government, there is actually no greater responsibility than the security of Australians. The review of Defence support for national counterterrorism arrangements, which was announced by the government in July last year, was initiated directly in response to the changing nature of the terrorist threat, as demonstrated in terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels and London. The amendments are the most significant changes to the Australian Defence Force call-out powers under part IIIAAA of the Defence Act—the biggest changes since 2000, in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I can assure Senator McKim that, despite all of his interjections and his denial, the threats here in Australia are very real indeed. Since 2014, our national terrorism threat level has been at 'probable' for very good reason. In that time, we have had 40 major counterterrorism operations which have resulted in the prevention of 15 probable attacks on Australians. Sadly, seven still occurred. We have had 230 passports cancelled and we have hundreds of people on the national watchlist. Senator McKim, the threat is real and all of us have a duty to protect Australians from that. The amendments in this legislation will ensure that the ADF is better able to respond quickly to those terrorist threats. The bill will enhance the ability of the ADF to support state and territory police in responding to incidents of significant violence occurring in Australia, including terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the amendments, states and territories will continue to have primary responsibility for protecting life and properties in their jurisdictions—again contrary to what the Greens have said will be the case. State and territory police forces are well equipped to respond to modern domestic terrorism incidents and also play a primary role as first responders within minutes of an attack. However, the amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth can more easily respond to requests from states and territories for ADF assistance where the states and territories are not able, or believe that they're unlikely to be able, to protect themselves against incidents of significant violence. In deciding whether to call out the ADF, the Commonwealth will need to consider the nature of the incident and whether the call-out of the ADF would enhance the state or territory response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will highlight three things the amendments will do in particular. Firstly, they will allow the government to pre-authorise the ADF to respond to specified threats on land, at sea or in the air. Secondly, they will simplify, expand and clarify the ADF's power to search, seize and control movement during a violent or terrorist incident. Thirdly, they will enhance the ability of the ADF to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction. While the ADF's primary role for counterterrorism is offshore, the ADF has personnel, resources and specialist skills that can assist our emergency services to respond in the event of a terrorist attack.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  There is a lot of intolerance in the world, but nothing, really, could be more intolerant than punishing somebody simply for their beliefs. A core facet of a democracy is the importance of freedom of speech, and I would like this evening to talk about how disconcerting it is to see a country like Pakistan that declares itself a democracy and a member of the Commonwealth, sharing our shared values as a part of that Commonwealth, having on its statutes the death penalty for blasphemy. I thought this back when Asia Bibi was on death row in Pakistan. She has now, on appeal, been acquitted and released from prison but banned from travelling out of the country. In reality, she has swapped a cell for an ongoing form of incarceration and danger outside the relative protection of the prison, as she is hunted by Islamic extremists in her country. The appeal court made the observation in releasing her that there were no credible witnesses. Nine years is a long time to spend in prison for a circumstance in which there were no credible witnesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The case of Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian, is reasonably well known. She was reportedly charged in 2009 with blasphemy, arising from having drunk from a cup that was reserved for her fellow Muslim farm workers. That led to her being accused of having contaminated the water and, when she stood up for her beliefs, that accusation spiralled into one of blasphemy. She languished in a small cell from 2009 to 2018, separated from other prisoners for her own safety. Two Pakistani politicians who spoke out in support of her have been assassinated. The Christian minorities minister, Shahbaz Bhatti, and a Muslim politician named Salmaan Taseer were both killed after advocating on Bibi's behalf and criticising Pakistan's blasphemy laws. Taseer was killed by his very own personal protection officer. These two were brave men indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia provides foreign aid to Pakistan to the tune of about $50 million a year. The Department of Foreign Affairs report for 2016-17 states that the aid program for that year helped 3,800 Pakistani women who were survivors of domestic violence to access support services. One would suggest that Asia Bibi is facing the most extreme violence possible and, in all countries that declare themselves to be free and democratic, we should see people standing firm in her defence, making sure that this does not happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've learned from the actions of the international community in recent years that it's possible to exercise leverage on nations on matters of principle. No doubt leverage can be exercised on Pakistan, just as the American preacher recently released by Turkey and the individuals released by North Korea in recent times show that diplomatic pressure can be effective. Surely this applies to the elected government of Pakistan under Prime Minister Imran Khan, a renowned cricketer and international personality, who is familiar, of course, with the Western values that underpin the Commonwealth and has been exposed to aspects of democracy all over the world. It's hard to conceive that privately he would believe anyone should be executed on the charge of blasphemy. It's in his hands to protect Ms Bibi and allow her to travel abroad and to seek sanctuary from a willing country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a matter then of some pleasure that I saw in recent times that Australia has added its name to the list of nations that are willing to offer sanctuary to Asia Bibi. At a time when in this country we are having debates about religious freedom, about freedom of speech, it is fundamental that we stand up in this country and around the world for the fundamentals, and freedom of speech—the freedom to live your beliefs, speak those beliefs and do so without being reprimanded for offending another person—is absolutely non-negotiable. So I'm really pleased to see Australia take this strong stance against those who would oppress people who speak their mind and those who oppress people who simply want to live their faith and go about their work, go about their business, without intruding upon the rights of others to do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I seize this opportunity to encourage Pakistan to re-evaluate the way that it approaches freedom of speech, and I encourage our government to continue to defend these values at home and abroad in the years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:56</span>):  Today I was given the tragic news of the passing of Mrs Mabo. I will not use her first name out of respect for her family. It was only last year that I gave a speech to honour the 25th anniversary of the Mabo High Court ruling. Mrs Mabo, a South Sea islands woman, was an activist, an educator and a lifelong advocate for reconciliation. Her father came to Australia from Tanna Island, in Vanuatu, to work in the sugar plantations in Queensland. From 1863, some 62½ thousand people were so-called recruited, put on ships, sailed to Queensland and forced to work under harsh conditions, mostly on sugar plantations but also in the pastoral and maritime industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Mabo lived in a unit in Townsville, a city named after Robert Towns, a participant in what became a lucrative slave trade that coerced thousands of South Sea islanders to work as indentured labourers. All of this was before the White Australia policy, which sought to get South Sea islanders off Australia and back to the Pacific, often to islands they did not come from in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Mabo's family history is part of her history, and we will honour that by our own process of truth-telling. In my home town of Broome we have a shared history of blackbirding. Like the sugarcane plantations and their owners, the pearling industry was illustrious for the masters and renowned for the cruelty and treatment meted out to the Aboriginal peoples caught in the tide of indentured labour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1959 she married Eddie. Her love for Eddie is documented through a series of letters. Young and in love, Mrs Mabo and Eddie wrote to each other between her home in a shantytown on the edge of a Queensland sugar plantation and far-west Queensland, where Eddie was working as a fettler on the Queensland railway tracks. Together they had 10 children. She was an activist and a mum. The High Court took 10 years to reach a decision—a long, arduous fight that would not have been possible without the support and love of Mrs Mabo for Eddie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1973, together with Eddie, she co-founded Australia's first Indigenous school, the Black Community School in Townsville. Eddie was determined to see the songs and language of Mer taught to First Nations kids. Mrs Mabo already had six children and was pregnant with her seventh when the school opened. When Eddie sought funding, she worked as a teacher's aide and made sure that the school stayed true to its manifesto.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mabo family paved the way for my own activism and fight for a reconciled Australia, one that recognises First Nations peoples. Mrs Mabo had a fierce passion for reconciliation. She fought with a smile, always hopeful that common decency and a fair go could outweigh racism. She knew the power of conversation. She said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think the first step is getting to know somebody, sit down and spend a bit of time talking to people and maybe you'll get to know them and then maybe they'll say, 'Come on we'll go and have a barbie somewhere.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2002, Mrs Mabo called for 3 June to become a national holiday—the day the myth of terra nullius was realised and the day the High Court reached its final decision in the Mabo case, a decision we all know Eddie Mabo was not alive to witness. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'd go to my grave happy to know it's a day for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She could envision an Australia based on mutual respect and a shared history we could all be proud of. I remember visiting her in her home in Townsville, where we shared a pot of tea. She was reflecting on the desecration of her husband's tomb in Townsville, defaced and desecrated by vicious and hateful thugs. She was composed, considered and kind, feeling sorry for the vandals and pitying their ignorance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her own activism sought recognition for South Sea islanders across Australia. In the last 20 years she has fought for a process of truth-telling about the brutal treatment of her people. In 2013 she was recognised as an Officer of the Order of Australia—and I will quote the citation—for her:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… distinguished service to the indigenous community and to human rights as an advocate for the Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and South Sea Islander peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Mabo was the recipient of an Honorary Doctor of Letters from James Cook University only a few days ago. I'm grateful that she knew how proud of her we are and that she was continuously recognised, right up to her last days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I was very moved by the fact that today marks the reconciliation of two proud Australian souls, a loving couple who have made our country down here on earth a better place, a more harmonious place and a more reconciled nation. Kulia, Mrs Mabo.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="275424" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STORER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:03</span>):  I agree with the motivation behind the Green's Great Australian Bight Environment Protection Bill 2016, debated this morning. The Great Australian Bight is a unique Australian asset and is worth fighting to protect. As we heard earlier today in debate, the Great Australian Bight provides an essential breeding ground for threatened species such as the southern right whale and an ideal habitat for the endangered sea lion, as I saw on a recent visit to Kangaroo Island. We now know that there are at least 1,200 species of plants and animals in the region, around 85 per cent of which are probably endemic, making the bight one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. Those are all important points, but economic reality alone makes petroleum activity in the bight a clear loser for South Australia. The economic reality is that fishing and tourism industries provide critical, sustainable and long-term economic benefits to South Australia through thousands of jobs and billions of dollars each year. It is obvious that protecting the sustainability of those industries is in the best interest of South Australians and, indeed, all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fishing in the bight brings half a billion dollars a year to South Australia. Tuna, crab, prawns, sardines, lobster, oysters, abalone—the list goes on. The entire fishing and aquaculture industry could be wiped out in the event of a major oil spill, perhaps irreversibly. Tourism in the region also brings in about a billion dollars each year to South Australia, much of which could be irreversibly impacted from an oil spill. There are at least 10,000 tourism jobs based in the bight region, all of which would be under threat from a spill. As I said in September, we must not put that at risk from a future oil spill. It is worth remembering as well that modelling of economic benefits of petroleum activity in the bight is based on many assumptions, such as the volume of oil available for extraction and reliance on the global oil market, predicted by many to have a massive slowdown in the next couple of decades. This is not mere fearmongering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concerns run deeper, to the question of whether the current evaluation processes operate in the best interests of South Australians. The stakes are clearly too high to outsource decision-making on petroleum activities in the bight to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority; yet that is what currently occurs. The simplistic argument of streamlining regulatory requirements is not persuasive in this case. The minister should have ultimate oversight and responsibility for decisions which could have such massive ramifications. The current process of simply ticking a box which says that the risks have been reduced to as low as reasonably practicable—ALARP—and are acceptable is obviously at odds with the fact that even a small oil spill could be catastrophic for the region. Long-term consequences, including rehabilitation and remediation, should be appropriately taken into account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite those worries, it is important to acknowledge the considerable expertise that NOPSEMA does have in evaluating some narrow technical engineering and scientific risks at specific sites. Health and safety assessment, especially in remote isolated areas of the bight, where waves can reach up to 23 metres and water can be three kilometres deep, seems to be a combination which makes petroleum activity even more unsuitable. The so-called safeguard of a capping stack stationed on site just in case of a spill seems basically worthless in such treacherous weather conditions. Further insight into the flaws of the ALARP criteria is evident in the Montara case, which is a well that blew out in Australian waters near East Timor in 2009. The well was leaking for about three months, an equivalent period of time to the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. There are still 15,000 fishing and aquaculture operators in Timor who even today are pursuing a class action for compensation for that event, supported by the Indonesian government. Do we really believe that any oil company would have the capacity to fairly compensate the entire fishing and tourism industry in the case of an oil spill in the bight irreversibly leading to losses to the tune of billions of dollars each year for South Australia? The Montara case reminds us that current criteria have clear problems of compliance and enforcement. In those respects I agree with the motivation behind this bill that broader criteria of social licence, economic sustainability and irreversible environmental damage are not sufficiently taken into account in the current site-specific evaluation process. I agree that something has to be done and that NOPSEMA alone provides insufficient assessment of what is at stake in petroleum activity in the bight. But what? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has apparently realised this fact as well, announcing plans to broaden the content of what NOPSEMA must take into account. That is a positive step forward. However, I have serious reservations about whether those proposed changes are able to go far enough. Even if more content is submitted during the NOPSEMA review process, there remains the fundamental problem that NOPSEMA is still taking into account the same criteria to assess those submissions, so the idea of simply broadening what is submitted in the NOPSEMA evaluation phase may end up being a red herring, designed to make us feel more confident in a system that is actually distracting us from the real problem that NOPSEMA is more of a facilitator than a regulator. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we're debating today provides a clean option that removes complexity in the assessment processes and would not interact with other legislation by simply prohibiting any mining activity in the bight. But we already know the outcome: both the coalition and ALP will oppose that bill. As the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee review made clear, most of us agree that the assessment process currently undertaken by NOPSEMA should be broadened, at least to some extent. So I suggest the Senate's time could be much better spent debating realistic options that we might all be able to agree on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that score, this week I will propose a pragmatic bill that will return ultimate responsibility for petroleum activity in the bight to the minister, who would be forced to take into account more rigorous assessment criteria. It is an approach that I believe all parties can support as it is a workable and realistic solution. The ultimate authority to decide mining exploration and drilling applications should never have been outsourced to NOPSEMA back in 2014. The stakes are far too high to allow that decision to be delegated out. The minister should take personal responsibility to make that call after a rigorous and inclusive evaluation process such as those undertaken under the EPBC Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under my two-stage proposal, which I will outline in more detail later this sitting, the initial NOPSEMA review would be retained. If NOPSEMA approved an action then the EPBC Act review processes would kick in, with the final decision being made by the minister. This would mean a more rigorous evaluation process which would fairly balance environmental, social, economic and safety considerations by ensuring adequate public consultation and social licence. It would increase transparency and accountability in the decision-making process, with the minister acting consistently with additional considerations such as the precautionary principle, treaties and conventions, leading to improved public trust. It would strengthen powers of review by extending the definition of 'persons aggrieved' who could challenge an approval. Finally, it would ensure penalties for noncompliance are appropriately broad and strict. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another option that has been proposed is to list the bight on the World Heritage List. I would support such a proposal, both in order to protect the bight from risks of mining exploration and drilling and to lock in the status of the bight as a major tourist destination. That support, of course, would be conditional on appropriate assurances that there would be no negative impacts on the South Australian fishing industry, which as we know provides critical jobs and economic growth for South Australia. I'm also aware that the World Heritage Listing process would necessarily be lengthy, maybe taking three or four years. That seems too long to wait given the imminent threats to the bight by interested companies such as Equinor and others. It seems prudent to move ahead with enhanced assessment processes such as those outlined in my private senator's bill rather than just wait for World Heritage Listing, which is by no means guaranteed and could risk an oil spill in the meantime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, I would support the Great Australian bight Environment Protection Bill put forward this morning, but, knowing that the Australian Greens bill will fail to meet with the support of the Senate, I hope instead that the Senate will support my bill when it comes up for debate this week. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="217241" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:12</span>):  We are blessed in so many ways in my home state of Queensland. It's a great big state, a vast expanse of a state. It has a cornucopia of marvels across it. We are the Sunshine state. We are where tourists go. I don't believe there is a better state in this great nation—indeed, in this world—for people to spend their holidays. So I was very lucky to be in Roma at the beginning of this month, where we had the Outback Queensland Tourism Awards and the Outback Queensland Tourism annual general meeting. I attended there as a senator for Queensland but also representing Minister Birmingham, the federal minister for tourism. I met some fabulous tourism operators We had a really nice dinner on the tarmac of the Roma Airport, hosted by the Maranoa Regional Council. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to read out to you, Mr President, and to those listening at home, the winners of the Outback Queensland Tourism Awards: Major Tourist Attraction, Qantas Founders Museum; Tourist Attraction, Cobbold Gorge; Festival and Events, the Big Red Bash out at Birdsville; Festival and Events (special commendation), Mount Isa Rodeo; Cultural Tourism, Outback Pioneers; Visitor Information and Services, Julia Creek Visitors Information Centre; Tour and Transport Operators, Outback Aussie Tours; Caravan and Holiday Parks, Adels Grove; Hosted Accommodation, Cobbold Village; Best Outback Pub, Goldfield Hotel; Contribution Volunteer/Group, Gail Wipaki; Young Achiever, Becky Kuhl; New Tourism Business, the Waltzing Matilda Centre. Incidentally the federal government put $10,000 of taxpayers' money into the rebuild of the Waltzing Matilda Centre at Winton. Further winners of the awards were: Local Government, Quilpie Shire Council; Outback Mates Award, Greg Donovan; Vince Evert Award, Rod Low Mow. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution that these operators make to Queensland's economy cannot be understated. When tourists come to Queensland, where they go to the beaches or they go out west, they spend their money. Last year we had 2.7 million visitors come to Queensland, spending $5.7 billion. That's 2.7 million visitors spending $5.7 billion! This is massive, especially when 43c in every dollar are spent in regional Queensland. And that's why it alarms me, and it alarms a lot of people in Queensland, when we see what the state Labor government are doing in terms of how they are handling an issue that has the capacity to do serious damage to the tourist industry in Queensland. I don't know what it is with the Queensland state Labor government. I don't know whether it's wilful ignorance or whether it's just good old-fashioned Labor incompetence, but the Queensland Labor government's inaction over the recent shark attacks in North Queensland is truly disturbing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September, there were two shark attacks in the Whitsundays. Thankfully, these two attacks were not fatal, but they were very scary for the families concerned. I'm sure the sympathies of everyone in this chamber go out to those families. These attacks made news not just in Australia but around the world. Stories about the attacks could be found on the BBC, CNN and even Al Jazeera. Photos of Queensland beaches were put side by side with descriptions of these shark attacks. And at the beginning of this month, very sadly, we had a fatal shark attack in the Whitsundays. Our sympathies also go out to the family of that promising young medical professional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to look at the facts here. Commercial shark fishermen in the area, who I dare say have far more experience in this area than the clueless Labor government, are on the record stating that the shark population has grown enormously and is at plague proportions. It's the same if you talk to recreational fishermen, who spend their time on the water. They all say there is a massive shark problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are state Labor doing about this problem? Well, they've stalled for a time. They've talked about the issue, but they haven't taken any action. The Queensland Labor government's fisheries minister said, 'There has been no apparent increase in shark numbers,' even though accounts from people who spend their lives on the water—the commercial fishers and the recreational fishers—beg to differ. It's the same old pattern from Queensland Labor. They think that taking no action is better than taking any action whatsoever. They decided to have a talkfest and came up with a five-point plan. The five-point plan to deal with shark attacks is that the Labor government are going to commission a report; that's their first point. Congratulations! Then they're going to make sure that no-one can swim at Cid Harbour in the Whitsundays; that's their second point. Two points say the same thing: they'll develop an educational campaign. That's points 3 and 4. Well done! Then the final point is that they'll continue to meet with stakeholders to develop and progress responses. That's point 5. So all those who are going to go down to the beach, put their togs on, grab their beach towels and go for a swim should be reassured by the fact that the sharks are going to be dealt with by the state Labor government commissioning a report into those sharks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever the state Liberal National Party have suggested sensible courses of action, they've been shouted down by Labor and the crazy greenies up there. Labor and the greenies have opposed proposals for a sustainable shark cull to bring the shark population back under control, even though sharks are at plague levels. And this is the madness of the situation: we're not going to manage the shark population, but in Queensland we manage the kangaroo population; there are culls of kangaroos. We manage the rabbit population. Where I live on the Darling Downs, there's the rabbit board, which deals with the rabbits. We poison rabbits. Rabbits are evil. Rabbits won't give you a bite, but, if you go in the water, a shark is certainly going to give you a bit of a bite—and yet the state Labor government are not going to deal with this issue. They've opposed taking every single form of meaningful action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I condemn state Labor for their inaction. I condemn them for the damage they are going to do to our tourist industry. We cannot afford to have shark attacks in Queensland, because it's going to scare away the tourists. Because this state Labor government continue to do nothing, no-one will want to enjoy our brilliant beaches and no-one's going to come here. The 2.7 million tourists who spent over $5 million last year are not going to come to Queensland and they're not going to support our economy. I urge my Queensland Labor Senate colleagues to speak to their state friends and have some action taken. Otherwise, get out of the way and let the Queensland Liberal National Party save our tourism industry and our state from being run into the ground. The only good shark is one that is served with chips and a light dusting of salt.</span>
