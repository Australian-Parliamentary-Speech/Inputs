                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  Members, I take this opportunity to note that, on 11 March, Australia joined 52 other countries around the world in celebrating Commonwealth Day. Since 1977, Commonwealth Day has been celebrated annually on the second Monday in March. Commonwealth Day highlights the far-reaching and deep-rooted networks of friendships and goodwill that exist between Commonwealth nations. This year's Commonwealth Day theme, 'A Connected Commonwealth', recognises the old ties and the new links enabling international cooperation between Commonwealth countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth. In 1949 the association we now know, the Commonwealth of Nations, came into being with its membership based on free and equal voluntary cooperation. The Commonwealth is now one of the world's oldest political associations of states and, as members would be aware, Australia shares important historical connections with many of its members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Commonwealth is home to 2.4 billion people, spanning Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific. This vast network of countries performs an important role in promoting international cooperation. The Commonwealth's 53 members are united by shared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. These shared principles are embodied in the Charter of the Commonwealth, which commits member states to the development of free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth. It could be said that now more than ever promoting these values is relevant to achieving international peace and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a particular pleasure to mark Commonwealth Day this year as the parliament has recently rejoined the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The CPA traces its origins to the Empire Parliamentary Association, which was formed in 1911, with our parliament one of the founding members. The CPA emerged from the Empire Parliamentary Association in October 1948, as parliamentarians preceded their governments by several months in recognising that the future lay in working together as equals, cooperating to build the postwar world. Today the CPA has branches in over 180 jurisdictions, and it continues to be the natural centre for members and officials of parliaments to learn their profession from each other and to contribute to the improvement of governance throughout the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As is customary, Her Majesty the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth and patron of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, issued a message for Commonwealth Day 2019, and I'm pleased to present her message to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  I have a short statement on the House division recording system. Members will notice a small change during divisions in the House this week. I'm very pleased to advise that the Department of the House of Representatives, working with the Department of Parliamentary Services, has developed an electronic division recording system. This will not change the way in which members cast their vote. The House division recording system will simply replace the current paper and clipboards used by the tellers to record votes in the House with an iPad. The tellers will continue to be appointed. They will conduct the count and certify the outcome of each division, as is the current practice. Should for some reason the electronic recording system fail, the tellers of course will simply revert to their old system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Briefs have been provided to the whips, who are responsible for the counting, and the relevant training has been undertaken by the tellers. The clerks and the tellers will be trialling this system at the first opportunity this week. The implementation of the recording system requires no changes to the process of voting or standing orders and no changes to the fabric of the chamber. Importantly, it will deliver immediate publication of the results and the information on divisions for observers of the proceedings and will provide significant time savings for the House. Developed in-house, I'm certain members will agree this is an excellent initiative of the parliamentary departments, and I thank the House.</span>

In accordance with standing order 229(b), as the House was not expected to sit for several weeks, the appointment became effective on that date.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  Walking into this chamber representing the people of Melbourne Ports to serve the Commonwealth of Australia has been the greatest honour of my life, other than when my beloved Amanda, who's sitting up there in the gallery, agreed to become my wife. We're a bit eccentric. We were married in this building just after Labor was last elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 100 years, I'll be the last member for Melbourne Ports. For two decades, Australian Labor gave me this privilege. I owe it and the people of my electorate everything. I gave the job my all. People sometimes disagree with meâwell, not just sometimesâbut few have doubted my sincerity or diligence to Melbourne Ports. I hope it was enough. I couldn't have done more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For two decades, my precious wife, Amanda, my kids, Byron and Laura, who I am so proud of, who are sitting in the gallery, my brother Simon and his wife, Miriam, our wider family, led by David and Peppy Sherr, my friends and staff, and party workers and volunteers have been there for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Could I have persevered without the Pinskiers, Kimberley Kitching, Sylvia and Maurie Freeman, Moishe Gordon, Ari Suss, the Zajacs and Nathan Shafir or my dear mate the late Con Sciacca? Could I have persevered without the friendship of Bunna Walsh the former member for Albert Park, lately Martin Foley, and Andrew Landeryouâa blood brother from university days who has always been there for me? Without all of them, without their support, their love, their belief in me and most importantly in the cause of Labor, or at least the Australian variety of it, I would not have been preselected four times or seven times re-elected. My name's on the office door, but I've always been conscious of who put me there. I'm deeply, almost spiritually, satisfied to feel that I've repaid the opportunity I've been given by my loved ones, my comrades, my local community and my country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many young people who've started their political life in my office, something I'm particularly proud of. I'm pleased that so many of my loyal and talented staff are here today in the gallery. How lucky I am that two of my PraetoriansâTonya Stevens, returned especially from Germany, and Jamie Bingham, who came back from Spainâto help me with the last eight months of transition. And young Alon has turned out to be a real gun in data and social media. God bless Kristen Barryâthe Dee Dee Myers of Australiaâmy dear friend from the Griffo days, who moved from Sydney to Melbourne just in the nick of time to help with the last few months. A learned and respected Australian rabbi James Kennard once called me a yasharâliterally 'straight'. Okay, I'm a bit unbending. Sometimes I see issues as right over wrong, however inconvenient or costly it's been to my political advancement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I joined young Labor 45 years ago, I've fought the good fight to ensure our party is united, centrist, progressive, economically responsible but principle driven, internationalist but patrioticâa fight that good people like Bill Shorten and the rest of this party have won. I'm an unfashionable internationalist. I stand up for human rights here and around the world provided the cause is principally non-violent. I'm here for the Kurds, the Armenians, the Uygurs, the Tibetans, the Dafuris, the Baha'is and prisoners in North Korean concentration camps. Yes, I happily wear the hair shirt, the member for lost causes. Some have tried, like Ulysses, to strap themselves blindfolded to the mast to avoid my siren calls about Beijing's aggression as it laps our fateful shores. No-one has had to alert me to confront rightist extremism in the virulent forms into which it frequently mutates. I've successfully sued LaRouchites. One Nation's James Ashby I long made infamous before his current disgraceful behaviour. Even a bigoted local Liberal, the Basil Fawlty of Middle Park, I forced his expulsion from the local Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember my first speech in this chamber like it was yesterday. Then, as now, Labor was on the wrong side of this chamber. Australian Labor distinctly, unlike other Labour parties, is not interested in the purity of powerlessness. We're here to make a difference and to make the world a better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had worked for this parliament before the construction of this grand cathedral of democracy partially buried under a hill. In the old House, I worked for the late Barry Cohen, of blessed memory, and the equally brilliant Alan Griffiths. Their encouragement and nurturing fuelled my passion to serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon after coming here, I understood the wisdom of Paul Keating's aphorism that, when you get past the mezzanine floor, past rivalries melt away. So, prior to the passage of marriage equality, every year for 10 years, Anthony Albanese and I moved legislation for the equal treatment of same-sex couples under Commonwealth legislationâgood working with you, Albo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, since being elected in 1998, almost every week I've been tasked to host some international delegation. I take them to the little-used balconies on the second floor to gaze at resplendent Canberra. How proud my folks, Margaret and Fred, would have been to see me standing under that massive Australian flag.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing prepared me for the day I was elected. In my first speech, I remembered my grandparents Margarette and Bruno Danziger, both murdered by the Nazis, and my presence here today is proof that the final solution failed. All those wog kids like me who are now members of parliament on both sides intrinsically appreciate that our presence also says something about the pluralistic, inclusive nature of most Australians. We all made it. As my brother, Simon, says, 'Australia, what a country!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me skip through the years. Fifteen years after election, Julia Gillard picked me as junior arts minister and Tony Burke kindly let me introduce my only piece of legislation, major changes to the Australia Council. But then Prime Minister Gillard sent me to Germany to supervise, with Indigenous elders, the return of stolen remains, a process ironically handled better in Germany than in France or Great Britain. It was the most poignant moment of my days as an MP, representing our country in Germany. Our respected ambassador ambushed me. It was Anzac Day. He insisted that I, not he, was to speak at the ceremony at the Commonwealth war graves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine me in Berlin, in the cemetery, with our Indigenous friends, in front of 700-plus diplomats, military attaches and soldiers of the Bundeswehr. I know that this parliament and Australians, who have always stood for freedom, would be pleased that, in a reunited German capital, I looked them straight in the eye and reminded them of the painful contrast between the treatment of two artillerymen. The first was my Australian grandfather Lieutenant John Peek, 4th Division Artillery Column of the 11th Brigade, who fought there in Amiens and all the way till the end in the first war. He was treated with honour by our country. By contrast my German grandfather Hauptmann Bruno Danziger, Iron Cross, First Class, 151st regiment of artillery, whose epaulettes are all that I have to remind me of him, was deported and murdered in Auschwitz by his own country. So an Australian minister reminded the current German state of that contrast, and that is a victory for all of usâall of us in Australia and all of those who suffered. As I left the Commonwealth cemetery, our Indigenous brothers and sisters were sitting at the gate, and they were smiling at me. One of them said to me, 'We know where you're coming from, brother.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never had illusions that being an advocate of my electorate's support for the Jewish state would be fashionable. I was warned of the perils of being stereotyped by the usual suspects as a Jewish MP overly concerned with the fate of Israel. I wrestled with that advice but, given my background, not for long. The truth is that, as Edmund Burke said in the days before gender-inclusive language became the norm:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this building, on both sides, in my own party, on its left and right, in my own local communityâwhich is quite progressive and more interested in Middle Eastern cuisine than Middle Eastern politicsâit's not always politically convenient to stand up for the region's sole democracy. They're having one of their all-out democratic dust-ups just before we have ours, and I wish them well. It cost me votes; hopefully, it attracted some too. Certainly the psephological evidence is that it did. But the truth is that, while everyone in this chamber is under an obligation to care about winning support, and I did, I would rather have lost every election, every preselection and every internal party contest if winning meant I had to corrupt my beliefs to the prejudices of the few who hate stiff-necked Jews like me. I've lost many platforms because I don't believe in the ethos 'whatever it takes'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie Wilson was an American congressman who was able to make his imprint on history from the backblocks. Through my 21 years, there have been many events where I've felt I have successfully waged Charlie Wilson's war and made that difference. Some will find it eye-glazing, but for seven years I waged a struggle, sometimes behind enemy lines, mostly without leadership approval, to free the Electoral Commission to allow it to automatically update the electoral roll. It gives me immense satisfaction that two million more Australians will vote in this election than would if we'd allowed the older system of snail-mail validation to persistâCharlie Wilson's war.</span>

After Beijing tried to wreck Ms Kadeer's appearance at the Melbourne International Film Festival for her film, <span style="font-style:italic;">The 10 Conditions of Love</span>, 6,000 people held a foot-stamping tribute to her in the Melbourne town hall which I co-hosted. It created such international publicity against the authoritarian oppression of the Uygur people that <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Yorker</span> paid tribute to our solidarity in Australia with Ms Kadeer and the Uygurs, with the headline 'We are all Melbournian'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always stood with the Baha'is, so terribly abused in Iran. In 2009 my little electoral office organised in Melbourne the ninth international conference on human rights in North Korea. Given my background, it was my duty to remember that there are 300,000 people in concentration camps, even as we speak, in North Korea. It was a special act of memory that I organised the first ever publication of a map detailing the names and places of these concentration camps which expose the Kim regimes for what they are. The map was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last but not least, there's my 20 years of devotion to the cause of the peaceful Buddhist people of Tibet, many of whom are sitting in the gallery. We took the first Australian parliamentary delegation to the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamshala. I would've waged Charlie Wilson's war alone for that moment in Dharamshala where the Dalai Lama asked me to speak to 5,000 saffron-clad Tibetan monks and their families. My dear friend Tenzin Atisha is here in the gallery, as is His Holiness's representative Lhakpa TshokoâI tell you: I'm not a Buddhist, but working for the Dalai Lama's vision of a peaceful, autonomous 'third way' has given me more karma than anything that you've received in political support from me. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the treatment of the Uygurs, the Tibetans, the Mongols, many dissidents, including Australian citizens unjustly jailed there, and Labor union dissidents, it's no wonder I was a happy warrior in my most current and minor official capacity as the deputy chairman of the Treaties Committee. It's no coincidence that the Senate disallowed the extradition treaty with China. I'll never regret using my capacity to articulate why it would be oppressive for Australia's 900,000 Chinese Australians to be threatened with the prospect of being extradited to the tender mercies of Beijing. Some will remember my campaigns on Huawei and other Charlie-Wilson and Don-Quixote tilts at windmills. Actually, with Huawei being banned from the NBN and 5G, it seems that someone knocked over those windmills!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor was I the apple of the eye of the former foreign minister Julie Bishop. I placed an enormous electronic billboard in St Kilda, knocking her government's romance with Iran, but I'm proud of the fact that I forced the Turnbull government to hold an inquiry into the lifting of some of the government's sanctions on Iran despite Iran's notorious behaviour around the world. The committee conducted the inquiry, which was critical of the government's approach in lifting sanctions without adequate safeguards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow we will welcome the new US Ambassador to this place. I've known the last seven US ambassadors to Australia. Anyone who reads my time line knows that I'm no big fan of the current US President. But whether it's early rock 'n' rollâin particular, Chuck Berryâthe better products of Hollywood or the civilised debate in the high-end US media, we need our friendship with the United States. Navigating our relationship with America is a basic bottom line for an island continent like Australia. Democracies need to stick together. And I pay tribute to the US Charge' d'Affaires, Jim Caruso, who is in the gallery, for the fantastic work he has done in cementing relationships between our two great countries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I leave parliament, after nearly 20 years, a happy warrior, with my party in the best hands I've seen it. We have a well-led team, and Labor will, if elected, have the most accomplished and gender-balanced ministries in the history of the Federation. The immortal Australian actor Leo McKern, as Rumpole of the Bailey at his supposed retirement party, found his treatment so felicitous that he denied any suggestion he was leaving chambers. He accepted the clock he was being given as a moving tribute as evidence of how much they needed him. Like Rumpole, part of me desperately wants to stay. But I know it's my time. I will be the last member for Melbourne Ports. It's pleasing that my friend and former staffer Josh Byrnes, who subsequently served Premier Andrews, has stepped up, and I hope he'll succeed me in the new seat of Macnamara. So I go out under my own steam, with a successor I approve, and I believe Labor will hold the seat. How many in politics win a trifecta like that?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Shorten's Labor Partyâhis leadershipâis a vindication of every fight, every victory and every sacrifice I've experienced on the battlefield of Labor politics since, as a 17-year-old, I wandered into the legendary final election rally at the St Kilda Town Hall in 1972. We can never be complacent, but this party has never been stronger, never more united, in all my years of observation. And I don't say this lightly; I've been through many struggles over the last 35 years. I believe the member for Maribyrnong will win the next election. He'll be a Prime Minister in the mould of Bob Hawke, who set a high standard that has not been matched since. In Bill, we have the last great hope in international politics for the success of social democracy around the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel a deep nostalgia for this place, and all it stands for, before I walk out the doors for the last time. As I pack the boxes and farewell the hardworking people who keep this grand building workingâthe attendants; the drivers; library researchers like Geoff Wade; and committee staff like Jerome Brown, Clarissa Surtees and Dr Anna DacreâI feel a longing for all the unfinished business I leave here. Although I moved a first reading of the Magnitsky Act, it is not enshrined in our law. The government has come to favour having a legislative device for pushing back against corruption and human rights abuses by authoritarian countries. I say to this parliament that Magnitsky would allow usâlike the US, Canada and the UKâto tell states like Russia that you can't kill 38 Australians and get away with it. Unfortunately we seem to have run out of time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Facebook's live streaming of a white supremacist snuff movie after Christchurch is the latest excess of an out-of-control online world where social media has been weaponised by both malevolent and anonymous trolls to threaten violence and defame opponents. Worse, it has been used by states in information wars, in interfering in the recent US and French elections. My suggestion to this parliament, which I hope you take up in legislation, is that social media must have real identities behind each Twitter, Facebook and Instagram account, and that will balance the world out. Then they will be treated like the normal media and be subject to the same rules of all countries, as they should be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country, in my view, is still unprepared for the challenge from Beijing. But I've seen such resistance and such united action across the aisles, and in the media, that I have every confidence that, in the future, we'll handle that problem. As the clock races down, can you see I miss parliament already. I miss the opportunity to help set the nation's agenda. I miss all of you already. There's a nobility of purpose to this building, even when debate is at its most robust or the behaviour, and some attacks, are lower than community expectations of us.</span>

We're all here, a band of brothers and sisters, serving the country we love and the people who make it so worth loving. And, as I leave, I hope these words from Theodore Roosevelt are remembered by those serving in the next parliament, the 46th Parliamentâthey might sustain you in the lonely nights, the cold winters, after the crushing character assessments that come so freely to you from the fourth estate, the opposition and even your colleagues:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</span>

Surely my humble career shows that each of us, each parliamentarian, can make a difference. We can strive to make this wonderful 'Straya' a better place.</span>

I would like to thank the former chair of the committee, Steve Irons, and the current chair, Michael Sukkar, who is not here. In particular, I'd like to thank the secretariat, so ably led by Patrick Hodder and his team. Particularly, the franchising report is a tremendous piece of work that creates the opportunity for us to see significant improvements in the sector in the years to come. I commend these reports to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee reviewed progress made in relation to the provision of services under the NDIS for people with psychosocial disabilities since the release of its report in August 2017. The committee is concerned by the lack of progress in ensuring that people with a psychosocial disability can access appropriate support services under the NDIS or outside the scheme. In essence, the challenges associated with the transition to the NDIS for eligible participants and continuity of support for those outside the scheme remain significant. The committee heard that issues around inconsistencies in eligibility and planning outcomes, as well as issues with the planning process and adequacy of plans, were continuing to jeopardise people's access to appropriate, reasonable and necessary supports. The uncertainty and lack of clarity around how continuity of support arrangements for those outside the scheme will be delivered in the near future requires urgent attention from all governments. The committee welcomes the recent government announcement to extend funding to support transition of people in Commonwealth-funded programs to the NDIS. However, longer-term arrangements for existing program clients not eligible for the NDIS should be put in place before closure of existing programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to progress made in the provision of services under the NDIS Early Childhood Early Intervention approach, the committee heard that improvements have occurred since the inquiry. However, some key issues remain and include delays in provision of services, significant challenges in addressing the needs of children with autism spectrum disorder and the lack of a clear national strategy around the ECEI approach under the NDIS. Indeed, the committee is gravely concerned by the recent reports of long delays in accessing early intervention support services under the ECEI pathway. The committee also heard on many occasions that best practices deliver early childhood intervention services in natural settings. However, it appears that under the current NDIS pricing structure it has become unviable for service providers to do so. The committee is of the view that early childhood service delivery models under the NDIS should not be determined on the basis of cost drivers but on maximising outcomes for children so that they can reach their full potential.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to progress made since the transitional arrangements inquiry, the committee is concerned by the lack of progress in addressing interfaith issues between the NDIS and mainstream services, the worsening of areas within markets and the absence of clear provider of last resort arrangements. The committee acknowledges that the interface issue between the NDIS and mainstream services is complex. However, there is growing evidence that NDIS participants are being denied services and care because of funding disputes between the NDIA and other government services. In extreme cases, this is resulting in people being unable to leave hospitals for several months. The situation is untenable and requires immediate action, regardless of the state of progress of discussions of state and territory governments and ad hoc arrangements to delineate the roles and responsibilities of the NDIA and mainstream services. The committee is of the view that there should be an immediate introduction of a formal mechanism to ensure that a person-first approach is taken in the delivery of services in the event of funding disputes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the provision of hearing services, the committee acknowledges the significant work the NDIA has recently undertaken to develop referral and funding approaches that will appropriately support children with hearing loss, their families and their carers. The committee found the establishment of the referral pathway through Australian Hearing for newly diagnosed children aged nought to six years encouraging. However, the committee is concerned that this referral pathway has an uncertain future and is, in essence, an interim measure as the in-kind arrangements with Australian Hearing are only secured until 30 June 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other issues discussed in the report include the NDIA's communication with participants and service providers. The committee acknowledges the recent efforts made by the NDIA to increase its engagement with the disability sector. However, based on the evidence received by the committee, the engagement appears to be at times tokenistic. The committee is of the view that the NDIA should more systematically utilise the expertise of the sector to inform the development and review of its operations and guidelines. This would significantly assist the NDIA in developing initiatives to strengthen the effectiveness of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received a wealth of information and evidence through the inquiry and thanks all who participated. As a result, the committee has made 18 recommendations which aim to ensure that improved and appropriate arrangements can be put in place to provide necessary and reasonable supports for all NDIS participants and fully realise the objectives of the scheme. This is the ninth and final report in this parliament of the standing committee. I thank all those members of the committee who have worked assiduously throughout the parliament. I'd like to particularly thank the deputy chair, Senator Alex Gallacher, and I'd also like to acknowledge the work for this committee not just in this parliament but in previous parliaments of the retiring member for Jagajaga, Ms Jenny Macklin, who has brought a wealth of experience and thought to the process. Finally, I thank the members of the secretariat for all their wonderful efforts during the course of these inquiries in this parliament.</span>

                    </a>  by leaveâThese two reports conclude the business of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for this parliament, and they mean that nine reports have been presented to this parliament through the work of this committee. That has involved an enormous amount of work, and I acknowledge the contribution of the secretariat and those staff seconded from the Australian Electoral Commission, who have provided invaluable work to this committee, which has a particular set of responsibilities which go to safeguarding the quality of our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first report I want to turn to briefly is described as a survey report, and it reflects some ongoing work which will have to be attended to by, perhaps, the minister at the table, but more particularly the committee in the next parliament if we are to safeguard the quality of our democracy, particularly in an age which is characterised by an increasing capacity and preparedness to engage in disinformationâpractices which go to the heart of our capacity to have meaningful democratic conversations about the issues that matter to Australians. This is one of many significant matters that the successor committee to this committee will have to have regard to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee is also presenting to the House now a report on a bill which was introduced to the Senate and which would have the effect, in part, of lowering the voting age. On behalf of the Labor members, I just want to make two brief observations in respect of this. Firstly, I draw the attention of the House to the Labor recommendation, which is that in the next parliament we give proper consideration to this question of enabling 16- and 17-year-old Australians to vote but on the basis that we do not interfere with compulsory voting, which is another cornerstone of our democracy and a great guarantor not only of equal participation in our democratic processes but of its legitimacy across the community. This is of particular importance at times like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the people, particularly the young people and their representative organisations, who gave evidence to this committee and demonstrated to me and my colleagues on the committee that in young Australians, those below the present voting age, we have some incredible, articulate, visionary people, great activists, with a diverse range of interests and a passion for the future. And I have absolutely no doubt that our committee reaching out to young people in settings like schools has offered the opportunity for us all to think harder about how we can improve our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I commend both of these reports, but particularly the dissenting report of the Labor members in the voting bill report, to the House. I move:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr GILLESPIE:</span>
                    </a>  by leaveâI am pleased to present <span style="font-style:italic;">Cane toads on the march</span>, the report of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy's inquiry into controlling the spread of cane toads. Cane toads are a scourge on our land and native wildlife, and unfortunately there is no easy solution to get rid of them. But the federal, state and territory governments can work better to limit their numbers where they exist and, most importantly, to prevent them from invading the parts of Australia that remain untouched.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At one major frontline of the cane toad invasion, the committee has recommended funding for the modification of artificial water sources such as troughs and dams to prevent cane toads spreading from the Kimberley into the Pilbara and further into Western Australia. And I note this occasion of luck: there is a short 70-kilometre strip of land whose only available water source is man-made troughs and dams. That lends itself to constructing a physical waterless barrier which would prevent the march of the cane toads further south.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also recommended a suite of other measures for the Australian government, the states and the territories to pursue together to combat this pest. These include: funding projects for cane toad tadpole trapping and for suppressing cane toad eggs from hatching by using chemicals extracted from the dying cane toads themselves; funding further research from CSIRO, universities and other bodies in new biological control methods and including trials of those identified methods; improved measures to protect coastal islands from cane toads, just as we want to prevent them from spreading into the larger reaches of Western Australiaâand isolating and maintaining a barrier from cane toads getting onto our islands is equally important; and, most importantly, better cooperation with landholders, traditional owners and volunteer groups, new cooperative planning and monitoring efforts, and an expedited review of the National Cane Toad Threat Abatement Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the scientists in the community and the environmental groups, who have done so much already, and everyone who has contributed their knowledge and work to an extensive compendium of knowledge about this terrible pest in our nation. In particular, I thank the secretariat, for their wonderful help to the committee members, and those who made a submission. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALEXANDER:</span>
                    </a>  by leaveâThe automation and electrification of mass transit is a potentially revolutionary development in transport. Done well, it could make our cities and regions more accessible, livable, productive and sustainable. Achieving this outcome will demand vision and leadership from government. The committee's previous report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Building up and moving out</span>, set out a blueprint for the planning of our cities and regions. It identified opportunities for transforming connectivity through integrated multimodal transport networks. This current report is an extension of that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mass transit is the key to creating better mobility. Automation and electrification will make mass transit safer, more efficient, cleaner and quieter. But they will also demand changes in the regulatory environment and transport infrastructure. This will require planning and investment, with policy responses framed around the different requirements of cities and regionsâgreenfield sites and brownfield sites. Ideally, our transport networks will consist of seamless systems operating across a variety of transport modes. These networks will serve cities and regions that are characterised by densification and decentralisation. Mass transit will provide high-volume trunk routes as the arteries of the transport network, with shared mobility and active transport providing the capillaries of the system. The goal should be the creation of a new transport ecosystem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electrification of transport has the potential to lower costs, reduce the environmental impacts of land transport and enhance fuel security. Hydrogen fuel cell technology in particular has the capacity to power mass transit options. It is well suited to buses, trucks, long-haul vehicles and even trains. The key to electrification is ensuring that the relevant infrastructure, especially refuelling stations, is put in place. The synergies between automation and electrification mean that convergent development should be encouraged and that electrification and automation should be implemented and managed together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important thing the Australian government can provide to the future development of automated transport and new energy sources is vision. Within this vision, the Australian government should provide leadership and coordination of policy that focuses on consistency and interoperability between jurisdictions. It should also facilitate the development of national standards based on relevant international standards and coordinate the development of relevant energy and communications infrastructure. Governments need to commit to automation and alternative fuels by designing and building infrastructure around their requirements. It is also important that governments engage in the art of transition in managing the introduction of automated and electric vehicles. Not least of the government's responsibilities in this regard will be ensuring compatibility and interoperability of charging infrastructure, making sure that there is standard charging mechanisms for all vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this inquiry. This was a short inquiry. Nonetheless, the committee received high-quality evidence from a range of people and organisations dedicated to the improvement of our urban environment and transport networks. They provided clear evidence on the benefits of transport automation, mass transit and electrification and the need to clearly define a pathway to an automated and electrified future. I would also like to thank my committee colleagues for their considered and bipartisan work on this inquiry and throughout the 45th Parliament. It has been a pleasure to work with them, and I think we have shown what can be achieved when members of all parties work together in a constructive way. Last but not least, I would like to thank the secretariat for their dedicated and highly professional support of the committee throughout the parliament. On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  by leaveâI just want to take this opportunity, recognising, as the chair has just outlined, that this may be the last opportunity in this parliament for us to talk about the fabulous work of the committee that we've been chairing and that I've been deputy chair of over this parliament. I would encourage people to look at this report. It's a significant body of work which was turned around in a reasonably short period of time, I have to say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transport in our cities, between our cities and between our cities and our regions is something that's such a significant and important issue, and this was an opportunity for us as a committee to look at innovation in that space and the challenges and opportunities it presents. A range of really solid recommendations have been put forward by the committee to look at ways in which, if I can use the analogy of the transport committee, instead of having the future come down the track at us, we as a nation can actually apply some foresight and anticipate where those challenges and opportunities are and respond effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the committee's report provides some very good signposts around alternative fuels, infrastructure and communications infrastructure which are so much more closely knitted with transport infrastructure in this modern space. If we get all of those aspects right, we can really improve the connectivity across the nation that the chair talked about. So I would encourage people to have a look at the report. Have a look at the recommendations in particular, but also have a look at the significant discussion, because we had such fantastic contributions by many, many members of the community about the opportunities for automated mass transport and alternative fuel technology availability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main reason I wanted to speak today was to have the opportunity to thank very much the member for Bennelong, who chaired the committee. He has been a really inspiring chair. He has been really determined to work through the evidence and get a bipartisan position. Some of the best work that happens in this place happens in that frame and doesn't get enough attention. Sometimes chairs can be quite the opposite, so I wanted to acknowledge that the member for Bennelong wasn't like that. He took a very determined view that we should try to reach a bipartisan outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all the other committee members, who worked really hard. Most importantly, I specifically want to say thank you to the committee secretariat: Lynley Ducker, the committee secretary; Bill Pender, the inquiry secretary; Tegan Scott, the researcher; and Kelly Burt, the office manager. The work we do in this place is world class, and it's world class because of the outstanding calibre of the people who work in the parliament with us. They are too often the unsung heroes of this place. This committee secretariat did a professional and really outstanding job in putting together in this parliament two major reports, which I think have contributed very significantly to the national discussion. I want to put on record my appreciation for their work. Hopefully, we will see this committee, which has a long and very proud history across many parliaments, continue to do that in the next parliament as well.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOWARTH:</span>
                    </a>  by leaveâThe Australian music industry is a challenging and highly competitive industry in which to pursue a career. Many Australians dream of a career in the music industry and being able to make a living out of their passion and talent for music.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that the Australian music industry works to ensure that artists and other industry careers are supported and sustainable, and that a diverse range of Australian artists are able to thrive. Investment in the support and promotion of Australian artists is essential to the retention of talent and, ultimately, the sustainability and growth of the Australian music industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian recorded music industry has experienced significant disruption as a result of technological advances and the rapid digitisation of the distribution of music, forcing the industry to adapt and evolve. It is no small challenge to successfully provide a competitive and attractive alternative to 'free' music. However, the recorded music industry's recent return to growth and decrease in the number of consumers downloading music illegally is evidence of the industry's successful adaptation to the digital disruption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its report, the committee encourages streaming services to publish clear, consistent and transparent information regarding how payments for artists are calculated. Furthermore, the committee found that the pricing cap on licence fees for the radio broadcast of sound recordings distorts the market in a way that disadvantages Australian artists and has recommended that the cap be removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A thriving live music scene is essential to the development of Australian artists. Throughout the inquiry, it became clear that the regulatory environment at the state and territory and local levels is a significant factor in the success of a city's live music venues and its music scene more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the Australian government invest in the Live Music Office to continue its work advising and supporting state and local governments to develop regulation that encourages and celebrates live music, rather than hindering it. It also recommends that the Australian government invest in supporting Australian artists to tour in Australia, both in major cities and in regional areas. I note that the government has announced a new $22Â½ million grant program to bring more live music to Australian communities and an additional $2 million to the Australia Council to increase performance opportunities for musicians, including in regional venues, through the Contemporary Music Touring Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australian music to flourish, it must be heard. It is essential that Australians can easily access and encounter Australian musicâhear it on the radio, find it on streaming playlists and hear it in our favourite television programs and in the films we see. The committee encourages music streaming services to work with the Australian music industry to establish benchmarks for Australian content on locally curated playlists and makes recommendations regarding the application and monitoring of Australian music content quotas for commercial radio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The digitisation of the distribution of music has provided unprecedented opportunity for Australian music to reach a global audience. The scale of Australian music exports is rapidly increasing, and the committee supports the Australian music industry's ambitious goal of Australian music gaining a five per cent market share of the global music market by 2030. The committee recommends that the Australian government invest in Sounds Australia's music exports program and that it prioritise and support Australian music at government activities and events. It also recommends that the Australian government work to develop mutually beneficial visa arrangements with the United States of America to allow artists from both countries to more easily showcase and tour. I note that the government has announced an additional $1.6 million for Sounds Australia to expand the reach of the program into new markets, including in Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian artists and the music they create are the product that every other part of the music industry exists to promote, sell or develop. Making music takes a significant investment from artistsânot only the cost of recording or staging music but also the time involved in learning their craft and applying their knowledge and skills to create great music. It is essential that Australia support and safeguard its talent pipeline, ensuring that Australian artists are able to create great music now and into the future to this end. The committee makes recommendations including: encouraging states and territories to improve access to music education for public primary and secondary school students; investing in initiatives aimed at training and supporting Australian artists and industry professionals to grow and develop their businesses; investing in grants and industry partnerships that support artists in the creation of new music and new recordings; and investing in Support Act to enable it to expand its services and deliver crisis support for Australian artists that are experiencing financial hardship, ill health, injury or mental health issues, preserving Australian talent and ensuring that artists are able to thrive during the good times and the bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, in addition to the measures mentioned already, the government has announced new programs funded in this year's budget that focus on women in music and Indigenous musicians. These national development programs will provide professional training in contract negotiation, marketing and finance as well as support for touring and recording and for planning effective touring circuits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank everyone who appeared before our committee to give evidence. I would like to especially thank the secretariat staff involved, who have been of great assistance to me and the committeeâCasey Mazzarella, Jazmine Rakic and Stephen Boyd. And I want to thank all the committee membersâespecially the deputy chair, the member for Gellibrandâand everyone who was involved in tabling this report. Thank you.</span>

                  </a>  I shall keep my remarks very short. I'm aware there are time constraints on the House this week. Suffice to say that we were welcomed by the three countries we visited: Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei. We were warmly welcomed, I must say, with all making it very clear that they value our friendship and valued the delegation, and that was very rewarding in itself. I must make a special note of Thailand, where it was obvious that our now Australians of the Year, Dr Richard Harris and Dr Craig Challen, are possibly even more famous there than they are here for their role in the rescue of the boys from the cave in Thailand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the other members of the delegation: the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Bruce; the member for Moore; and Senator O'Sullivan. I'd particularly like to thank our delegation secretary, chaperone and drafter of the chair's report, Michelle Brennan from the Parliamentary Library, for her capable assistance. To our embassies in Vietnam and Thailand and the high commission in Brunei, I extend the delegation's thanks. They were more than professional. They were absolutely on top of their task, and I congratulate them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  Last week, I finished the last of 21 community forums across my electorate, from Kingscote in Kangaroo Island to Victor Harbor on the southern Fleurieu Peninsula and right up to Houghton and the Lobethal communities at the other end of my electorate. Over the course of March, I heard from over 500 people at the forums. They were from all ages and backgrounds, from school-age environmental campaigners to self-funded retirees. Despite their differences, they all wanted the same things: action on climate change, access to quality education and affordable health care, and a focus on regional infrastructure. We have many of South Australia's fastest growing communities in MayoâMount Barker, Aldinga and the south coastâand we need to ensure that our roads, schools and hospitals will meet the growing need of our regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Kangaroo Island community, access to health care is indeed an urgent matter. The island's sole medical practice is based in Kingscote. It is difficult to secure an appointment with the GP due to the demand for services. The residents must also contend with travel costs and time spent travelling to and from Kingscote. I'd just like to say that Kingscote and Kangaroo Island, as a community, now no longer have any form of public transport across the very large island, which is deeply concerning. That's why I'm calling on the federal government to provide seed funding for a trial of a GP outreach service based in Kingscote that could also travel to Pandana, Penneshaw and, indeed, American River. Affordable access to high-quality health care is an issue felt keenly across my electorate, with the shortage of GPs resulting in the downgrading of emergency and after-hours services in a number of community hospitals. And that's why I'm calling on the government to make a significant investment in the Mount Barker hospital emergency department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do welcome the announcement of $8.6 million that was provided for the expansion of the emergency department, but many experts in the community believe that this is not enough. This is really just a bandaid solution. Based on the seven per cent population share of the nation, SA alone should have received $93 million of the government's proposed $1.3 billion community hospital program. So $15 million for a hospital infrastructure project that serves a local population catchment of well in excess of 80,000 peopleâand particularly as Mount Barker itself is set to grow to 55,000 peopleâis not only fair and reasonable but means that our community will receive the level of health care that it needs and deserves. With respect to health care, there is such a difference between whether you live in metropolitan South Australia or in regional South Australia. We really are treated as second-class citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dental care is often overlooked, but it is a fundamental aspect of health care. Unlike when you visit your GP, or even for a trip to the hospital, the majority of the costs for a visit to the dentist are funded by the patient, with Australians paying 58 per cent of out-of-pocket costs of dental care, compared to around 12 per cent for a GP visit. Because of the cost, over two million people avoided or delayed going to the dentist, and the situation is particularly challenging for those on low incomes, like our aged pensioners. That is why I'm committed to seeing the federal government fund a voucher system that enables people on the age pension to claim up to $1,000 for dental care in any two-year period. That must be able to be delivered in their own local community and that's why the voucher system that exists for those up to 18 years of age should, I believe, also be there for age pensioners. This should be the first of many steps in creating affordable access to dental care for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest policy failure of our current generation and of this parliament is our inability to move on climate change. No other policy issue has been plagued by such partisan attacks and no other policy issue has heralded the repeated fall of Australian prime ministers. Mayo is already feeling the effects of more volatile rainfall, with flash-flooding becoming a regular occurrence. Our communities on the Lower Lakes and beyond know only too well the devastation caused by drought. However, the lack of large-scale government support for long-term environmental rehabilitation and futureproofing means we are doomed to see the same story of agricultural and environmental distress repeat itself. My coastal communities are increasingly concerned and affected by king tides, severe storms, coastal erosion and sea level rise. My coastal councils are desperate for assistance because this is a problem that local governments simply do not have the financial capacity or expertise to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as is often the case, the community has provided the leadership that is so sorely lacking from government. Community environmental NGOs provide hundreds of thousands of hours of dedicated volunteer labour and a very cost-effective way of leveraging funding for maximum environmental benefit and effect. However, federal government funding for these organisations has been irregularâit has been scattergun. It has been diminishing the ability of our community environmental NGOs to maintain their capacity and provide consistent environmental assistance. A funding floor will guarantee that capacity will be sustained and long-term community and environmental projects can be started and finished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important truism to state that education is critical to the future prosperity of our community. Education creates so many social benefits, including better employment outcomes, lower crime rates, improved civic engagement, reduced rates of drug addiction and healthier families. Transitioning young people from schooling to further education, whether that be vocational education and apprenticeships, on-the-job training or indeed tertiary education, is a major predictor of their future success. I know from my previous work in the youth sector and my regular meetings with local educators that we need urgent capital upgrades to Mount Barker and Victor Harbor TAFE SA campuses. If we don't act now, the ageing TAFE facilities will significantly restrict the quantity and quality of courses they can offer our young people, impacting severely on their future. It is utterly ridiculous that in my community, where we have one of the fastest growing regions, being Mount Barker, young people cannot do any construction courses at the local TAFE. It just beggars belief. If we want our young people to stay in our regions and in South Australia, we need the major parties to invest in quality training. That's why I'm calling on the government and the opposition to make an investment of more than $500,000 in Mayo's TAFEs. It's not a huge amount of money, but it will mean the world of difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must ensure that our public schools have the resources they need to meet the increase in demand, and that is why, as the education spokesperson for Centre Alliance, I negotiated an extra $424 million for South Australian schools through the Gonski 2.0 education reforms, with an extra $66 million for Mayo schools. But we need more. Schools across my electorate, from Eastern Fleurieu School in Strathalbyn to Mount Barker South Primary School, are at capacity. Multiple classes are being jammed into busy libraries or forced outside even during heatwave conditions. This simply should not be happening in a modern country like Australia. I am committed to improving education outcomes for Mayo and I will work with all levels of government to deliver fairer and stronger funding for our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as a regional and rural electorate and with limited public transport options, it's imperative that our local roads are maintained. It is unacceptable that I have constituents saying that their cars are actually being damaged as a result of our local roads falling into disrepair or that their friends won't come and visit them because they need a four-wheel drive to do so, and that's in places that are 50 kilometre or less, as the crow flies, to the city. To account for this inequity, South Australia for many years received supplementary road funding from the federal government. This funding recognised that South Australia had more than 11 per cent of the nation's local road network but received less than five per cent of national road funding. The previous Liberal government cut this funding in 2014. Centre Alliance successfully fought for the reinstatement of the supplementary road funding in South Australia in 2017, but that funding is coming to an end. Once that funding was reinstated, South Australia's regional councils received an extra $40 million over two years to assist with maintaining our extensive local road network. This funding is due to expire at the end of this financial year, on 30 June 2019. It is imperative that the government commit to extending this funding. It is fundamentally unfair that South Australia is left behind with respect to regional road infrastructure. I will continue to work hard for a better deal for our regional and rural communities right across Mayo.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental, social, economic and political challenges of our time. If we don't get it right our children and grandchildren will be paying the price and we will be counting the costs for generations to come. Climate change and the environment are top-of-mind issues for the people in my electorate of Wentworth. They're also of great concern to Australians everywhere. This will be a climate change and environment election, and the time to act is now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this morning, I met with Cassy Faux and Lauren McGrow, who were victims of the recent Tasmanian bushfires. When you consider there have been disastrous floods in Queensland, prolonged drought and storms, as well as a million dead fish in Menindee on the Darling River and a dramatic drop in temperature following a very long period of hot weather, it is clear we are seeing a rise in the prevalence of extreme weather events. I've spoken a number of times in this House about the need for urgent climate action. The cost of inaction will be significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important part of the climate argument is the impact on our environment, and today I would like to speak about the growing problem of ocean plastics. In the past fortnight, we saw a whale in the Philippines that starved to death after it ingested 40 kilograms of plastics. Forty kilograms is an enormous amount, and this was a wake-up call to all of us that we need to take action to limit the amount of plastic that is dumped into oceans and rivers worldwide. The global population is living, working and vacationing along the coasts, and coastal populations are in the front row for the greatest, most unprecedented plastic-waste tide ever faced. According to Boomerang Alliance, 275 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated globally each year. In 2016, over nine million tonnes of plastic entered the world's oceans. Ocean currents have formed five gigantic slow-moving whirlpools called gyres, where the plastic collects. Most of the plastic debris sinks or remains in the gyres, but a significant percentage of it is suspended in ocean water where it endangers sea life or washes onto our coastlines daily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO recently completed a survey which found that three-quarters of the rubbish along Australia's coast is plastic. Most of it comes from Australian sources, not the high seas, with the debris concentrated near cities. I was a volunteer this year in Clean Up Australia, and you couldn't miss the plastic debris.</span>

This was a memorial to the Chinese community, designed by a young school student, Daisy Brown. The project architect was Lewis MP Lee, the structural architect was Dr Peter Ho, the builder was Wing Hing Builders and it was all supervised by Lewis Lee. The unveiling ceremony for this project occurred on the weekend, out in the electorate of the agriculture minister, David Littleproud. We worked on this together; we were co-patrons with the mayor, Richard Marsh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the chairmanship of Jack Sun, the St George Chinese Community Memorial was a project which brought many people together. It was a wonderful opening ceremony, with the local councillors there and also Megan O'Hara Sullivan from the Toowoomba Shire Council. Also out there were Consul-General Shen Ang from the Consulate-General of the People's Republic of China and local community leaders: Hugh Polson from the Sunnybank RSL and Surendra Prasad. This event was overseen by Chek Ling, the heritage adviser.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simon Tang spoke, as did quite a few other people. Near the end of the project, we saw Melody Chen actually donate a dragon to the St George community. It was all about recognising the contribution of the Chinese diaspora to that part of St George, but it's a story that could be told in any town in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I rise with great news for the people of the Hinkler electorate: yesterday we announced that the federal government will contribute $173 million to the Hinkler Regional Deal. This is a game changer for our region. As part of that announcement, $40 million will be provided to the Fraser Coast Regional Council for the redevelopment of the town centre in Hervey Bay, something they've never had before. There was $7.7 million for an extension of the critical link through Hervey Bay which is known as Boundary Road and, of course, there was $9 million towards a $26 million upgrade at the local airport. That has already resulted in a contract with council for a manufacturer to go in there to build aeroplanes for export. That means 100 permanent jobs in that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Bundaberg area, there was $32 million for what's known as the Quay Street bypass and $10 million down to the Gladstone Ports Corporation. That is wholly state owned, but the state simply would not act and so we have acted. That will provide a multi-use conveyor which will allow more exports out of the Bundaberg port. Of course that will range right out into the west, into the minerals province of the North Burnett. All of those individuals looking to export from a closer port will now have that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to Deputy Premier Trad in Queensland: get on board! Stop playing political games; we need you to contribute to the deal into the region. Stop messing about because your Labor mates want you to; this is about real people in the regions. We can do something to change their livesâyou should do it, and do it now.</span>

I was joined by my sisters and my son, as well as Tim Pallas, Victoria's Treasurer, Henry Barlow, a local councillor, and hundreds of other visitors to the mosque that day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all at Virgin Mary Mosque for the welcome that they gave to general members of the community. It was the largest attendance I've seen in five years. Together, our communities came together to stand against terrorism and to reach out to our neighbours, both locally and in New Zealand, to say that we are one and to say that we mourn for those lostâfor the innocents in Christchurch, gunned down while in prayer in a place of worship and a place of sanctuary.</span>

Love will overcome, and understanding of one another and a neighbourly hello will see us through the darkest days.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  This year at the Brisbane International, I was delighted to also be a spectator for the Festival of Wheelchair Tennis. This festival, funded by the government, included âcome and try' sessions, an exhibition with Dylan Alcott and Heath Davidson and competitive matches involving several elite players. The competition saw six of the top 20 internationally ranked players compete in a doubles tournament. Along with more than 16,000 people who came through the gates during the two days of play, I had a wonderful time watching these talented athletes, and I look forward to seeing continued growth of this format of tennis in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the ATP World Team Cup coming to Brisbane in 2020, Tennis Queensland will again look to build on the 2019 wheelchair tennis event by engaging a larger playing field, and this time include a women's tournament and provide more community engagement opportunities for coaches, clubs and other stakeholders. The 2020 tournament will also launch the international wheelchair tennis calendar, providing a great lead-in to the Australian Open and the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I stand here today to warn this out of touch LNP government that there better not be any cuts to my community in this budget. Townsville has had enough of the cuts and chaos created by this government. I have listed a few demands that I want to let the government know need to be in the budget. First, reverse the $8.9 million cuts to Townsville hospital and health services. Second, reverse the millions of dollars in cuts to Townsville public schools and match Labor's $23.5 million. Third, match Labor's $4.1 million commitment to The Oasis Townsvilleâa hub that will support serving members, veterans, ex-serving members and their families before, during and after transition to civilian life. Fourth, match Labor's $200 million for hydropower on the Burdekin Falls Dam. If this government can fund Snowy Hydro in the south, then they can fund Burdekin hydro in the north. Fifth, match Labor's commitment to increase naval ship maintenance at the Townsville portâa new industry and hundreds of local jobs. Sixth, stop the LNP attack on the public sector and reverse the 200 ATO, 50 Defence and 19 CSIRO job cuts and match Labor's commitment of 200 jobs for the Department of Human Services. Seventh, reverse the cuts to TAFE and the cuts of $36 million to James Cook University and $38 million to Central Queensland University. My community will act on election day if these demands are not met. I will fight tooth and nail for local jobs.</span>

I must say that we are already beginning to see the benefits of a well-managed economy in my electorate. Last week, we had the announcement of $150 million for major roadworks in the Grey electorateâ$50 million on the Barrier Highway; $75 million on the Eyre Highway; and $25 million on Eyre Peninsula, which will soon have to cope with the closure of the railway there. It is a great outcome. Last week, we announced 16 new mobile phone towers across the electorate, with another two rounds of funding to come. The week before, I announced the establishment of a new headspace in Port Lincoln.</span>

That is what this Treasurer and our finance minister have done. They are returning Australia to surplus and putting us back in that strong position where we can get on with the jobs in our electorate and actually deliver the things that people wantâtelecommunications, road networks and mental health facilities. It is a great outcome, and I am so looking forward to tonight.</span>

Michael informed us that the last surviving widow of a World War II Victoria Cross recipient is 99-year-old Mrs Daphne Dunne from Kirribilli in New South Wales. Daphne's late husband, Albert Chowne VC, MM, was just 25 years old when he died in a courageous attack on a Japanese machine-gun post in Papua New Guinea.

These have been dear to my heart from the very first day in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are $9 million over three years for a rehabilitation facility for our youth in the Batemans Bay region, as a direct consequence of the recommendations of the Ice Taskforce. Next, $25 million are committed for the aquatic and arts precinct for the Eurobodallaâto match the grant from the state governmentâfor youngsters, injury healing, swimming and fitness. It was a long, arduous task to gain funding for Bundanon, which had been often left out, but finally Scott Morrison has recognised the unique legacy that has been given to our nation, for the arts, Indigenous culture regeneration and education, in the exhibition space in this wonderful place. Finally, there is $500 million to be allocated for the New South Wales section of the Princes Highway. Six years of badgering have now been rewarded.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  In 2017, the Treasurer, now Prime Minister, held up a black lump and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is coal. Do not be afraid â¦ It will not hurt you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, today, I met two bushfire survivors from the Huon Valley in Tasmania. And, believe me, they were afraid, and the shocking recent Tasmanian fires did hurt them. There was Cassy, who has a business in Geeveston, who told me of the effect of the fires on tourism as visitor numbers dwindle and accommodation bookings are cancelled. And there was Lauren, who told me there've been dozens of job losses as local businesses struggle from reduced demand and fire damage. Both women explained how what were previously once-in-a-generation extreme weather events are now happening year after year, with dramatic consequences right around Australia; how, by putting filthy coal before the health and safety of Australians, politicians are failing to protect us from harm; and how the Prime Minister especially is fuelling climate change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today, hopefully in the presence of Cassy and Lauren, I'm calling on the PM to take responsibility and to reach out to the bushfire survivors who are demanding he apologise directly for his climate inactionâbecause, if those on the government benches are not doing everything they can to fight climate change, they're just fuelling the fire.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Sydney property is one of the most talked-about subjects in my electorate. For most people in Berowra and most Australians, their home is their most important asset. We've had a significant property boom over the last decade, but conditions appear to be changing. Banks are making it harder to get a loan, and some are using the cover of the royal commission to achieve this. Real estate agents tell me that the market correction has happened and that Labor's housing taxes will see homes that have dropped in value drop further. Newspaper stories abound of 20 per cent declines in property prices over the last 12 months, including in my electorate. In my own area, the situation has been made worse as a result of the Berowra hailstorms, which caused people to move out of their homes unexpectedly and rent, creating a much tighter rental market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Home ownership is important. It's people's stake in the economic system. A healthy property sector is the harbinger of economic confidence. When the value of people's homes is increasing, they feel confident to spend and invest, but when it's decreasing, it affects confidence in the economy more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the coming election, there is a real choice for anyone who owns or rents property: the coalition and its plan for growth or Labor and its plan for tax. Labor's housing tax, increase in capital gains tax and changes to negative gearing will send housing prices down, rents up and confidence away. Labor's mistimed housing tax takes a cooling market and puts it in the deep freeze!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Since 2016, I have been working to build a better Burt. We know Centrelink is in crisis under this Liberal government. It is understaffed and under-resourced. Pensioners, the disabled and carers have already put up with enough, and delays at Centrelink only make their lives more difficult. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will create 40 permanent full-time Department of Human Services jobs in the electorate of Burt. These new positions will benefit thousands of residents across our region. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has turned its back on our area, and its years of cuts have left residents waiting longer and longer to receive support from these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These 40 jobs will not only speed up waiting times for those in our community; they will inject about $3 million a year into our local economy. Last week, I was ecstatic to be part of announcing that a Shorten Labor government will commit $929 million to Tonkin Highway projects in Perth's southern and eastern suburbs, across the electorates of Burt, Hasluck and Canning. Residents of Burt have been telling me for years of their frustrations with the highwayâin particular the need to upgrade the intersections of Hale, Welshpool and Kelvin roads. This funding will deliver on those upgrades. The funding will not only make our roads safer; it will ease congestion, which will decrease the time people spend on the roads and make their work-life balance better. This is all part of delivering a fair go for my community and continuing to build a better Burt.</span>

This burgeoning community and surrounding suburbs Pimpama, Willow Vale and Wongawallan have seen rapid increases over the past few years. I'm pleased to say that during the break in sittings, the government announced a new fully funded MRI licence for the Upper Coomera community, which will be of great benefit to that community. It will allow services to be provided locally, saving residents from going down to the Gold Coast for scans. Importantly, this is about saving lives and providing health and medical services where people live. We understand the importance of these facilities. For people feeling stressed, having health issues or with difficult family circumstances, having these services right on their doorstep will be an enormous boon. I want to thank the team at Qscan radiology clinics and congratulate them on successfully obtaining this fully Medicare funded MRI licence. It will not only be the MRI but the other services that will go with that, such as X-rays and CT scans. It will provide a full suite of radiology services for the Upper Coomera communityâjust another example of this government's record investment in health across the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I wish to pay tribute to His Eminence Archbishop Stylianos Harkianakis, who passed away last Monday. I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to the Greek community and to His Eminence's family. Archbishop Stylianos served as the primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of Australia since 1975 and was truly a modern spiritual leader. He made an extraordinary contribution to the Greek Orthodox community and beyond. His Eminence founded the first Greek Orthodox seminary in the Southern Hemisphere, with the establishment of St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College in Sydney. He had a strong sense of justice, was passionate about education, and worked tirelessly to help children with special needs and the elderly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His Eminence loved the beauty of poetry and was himself an accomplished poet, publishing 37 collections of his work. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to attend many functions and gatherings with His Eminence and spend time with him during celebrations at St Spyridon parish in Kingsford, St Spyridon College at Maroubra, St Catherine parish at Mascot and the Castellorizian nursing home in Kensington, all of which serve the thriving and passionate Greek orthodox community that I am proud to represent in this parliament. It was a privilege to attend the annual Epiphany Festival celebrations at Yarra Bay, led by His Eminence, who performed the blessing of the waters. He will be sorely missed by all Australians. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Today I would like to bring to your attention a very serious traffic issue in my electorate of Bonner: the chaotic roundabout at Rochedale Road and Priestdale Road and their associated roads. This is effectively a convergence of traffic from four local schools and an early learning centre. At school drop-off time, it is utterly chaotic. A few months ago, I was approached by Warren Craze, a very concerned local resident and parent of a student at one of the local schools. He spoke to me about the ongoing issues associated with this local traffic hazard, and so immediately after speaking with Mr Craze I began a petition calling for support from the community. I have gathered almost a thousand signatures from concerned locals in just a few short weeks.</span>

The total cost of this project is estimated to be $28 million. I'm working alongside the newly elected lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, and the minister for urban congestion and infrastructure, the Hon. Alan Tudge, to fix this issue. Having grown up in Bonner, I know what my electorate wants and needs and I will always work hard to deliver for them.</span>

In allowing the shipments, the government is going against its own review recommendations and once again relying on assurances from a discredited industry that claims the new standards will prevent sheep from suffering. This is the same industry that, for the past four decades, has failed to clean up its bad practices; that has been the subject of several damning reviews; that has been given numerous chances to get its house in order; and that has now lost the confidence of the Australian people. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compliance with appropriate animal welfare standards cannot be guaranteed once sheep leave Australia and are in another country or on the waters, and they certainly cannot be guaranteed while northern summer temperatures present unmanageable risks regardless of stocking densities. No level of sheep deaths on board export ships is acceptable, and the industry should be assisted to transition to exporting locally processed chilled meat. The Morrison government should follow Labor's lead, take note of its own reviews and commit to ending live sheep exports and the unnecessary suffering.</span>

On one hand, they have a Liberal-National coalition government which has cut their business taxes and will cut them further, has extended their instant asset write-off and has reduced their red tape by nearly $6 billion. We've introduced 20-day payment terms on government contracts and created billions of dollars of new export opportunities through free trade agreements. On the other hand, they have a Labor Party which wants to increase company taxes, introduce a 30 per cent tax grab on discretionary trusts, send energy bills skyrocketing with their extremist ideology, increase penalty rates and leave small businesses vulnerable to $8 billion dollars in holiday back pay for casual workers who've already received their extra loading. It is a choice between a Liberal-National government that is delivering our first budget surplus in 12 years, has created 1.2 million new jobs and has the second-fastest growing economy in the G20 or an economy-destroying Labor Party more interested in placating the unions and the Greens than in increasing prosperity for all of us. Small and family businesses are the backbone of this country and the lifeblood of my local community. The Liberal-National Party understands their hard work, their contribution and their commitment to local communities. We will never stop working hard for small businessesâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I rise to speak about an important matter affecting some rail workers in my electorate. The Sydney Metro Northwest is scheduled to commence operations in May and, now the project is nearing completion, the north-west metro trains facility and operations centre is located in that part of Rouse Hill that is in my electorate. I've recently been made aware of a series of industrial issues at the metro site, including concerns about rosters, the lack of fatigue management standards, work-life balance and even matters as basic as how much workers are going to be paid. These conditions matter. They are standard across the rail industry and have been designed to keep workers safe and, in doing so, to keep safe the hundreds of thousands of passengers who use public transport every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been informed that last week Sydney Metro terminated the employment of a Rail Tram and Bus Union delegate without a reason. I'm informed that Sydney Metro has relied on spurious reasons at best to support their action to terminate this delegate's employment. I am also informed there are very serious concerns that the delegate's employment was terminated due to his involvement with the union, including his attempts to fight for a fair agreement for all operational employees. I do hope that this is not the case and that these matters are promptly resolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers, no matter where they are, have the right to bargain and organise collectively, and they should be able to do so without facing intimidation or the fear of reprisal. These matters need to be addressed urgently, so I say to the workers at Sydney Metro: I stand in solidarity with you in your fight for the fair workplace agreement you deserve.</span>

It's a really exciting announcement. Over the weekend I was joined by nearly 100 members of the local community for a barbecue to announce that the Peninsula Recreation Precinct at Umina Beach will undergo a multimillion transformation, with $8.25 million in commitment from this government to upgrade the precinct.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our sporting clubs are the lifeblood of the community on the peninsula, and this project is about making sure that our kids have access to outstanding sporting infrastructure, connecting families and our community together and making sure there is something for every age group. I had the chance to sit down with some of the kids using the tired skate park that's currently there and members of some of the local sporting groups, and they shared with me just how much this means for them and how proud they are, knowing that the peninsula will have access to some of the best sporting infrastructure and facilities around.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to Rod Unsworth, Tony Winch and Mark Nitsos from the Umina Community Group for all their hard work over the past two years in advocating for this and for bringing the community together in the process. I'd also like to pay special tribute to Gabby Greyem from Jasmine Greens Park Kiosk for her continued advocacy for this project and the peninsula. And to each and every person who signed the petition, sent me an email, came up to me in the streets and added their voice: this happened because of your voice and your commitment to our community.</span>

I'm grateful to them for the stable and loving home they gave me and I'm grateful to this nation for the first-class public education I received, because it changed my life and it changed the course of our family's life for generations. I see it as one of my most profound responsibilities to pass on those same opportunities to subsequent generations of Australians: to my own children and to children just like themâmillions of children, right around Australia.</span>

We know those opposite have cut $14 billion from growth in public school funding. They've agreed to fund Catholic and independent schools, and we join them in supporting the restoration of funding for Catholic and independent schools. But it's public schools that teach two out of every three Australian children, and it's public schools that now face these $14 billion of cuts. But Labor will restore every single dollar.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  Our community is blessed with amazing beaches on Port Phillip. This summer there was good and bad news for beachgoers from the EPA about water quality. Black Rock ranked fifth of the beaches in Melbourne. Hampton was sixth. Sadly, Brighton ranked lower than we all would have liked. Beach pollution takes many forms, including litter, such as cigarette butts and microplastics, and also stormwater, which carries pollutants, including oil, into our precious waters. I saw it first-hand with Hampton beach patrol on Clean Up Australia Day this year. It took less than an hour to pick up a whole bag of rubbish. Rubbish has become so problematic that Bayside council recently announced plans to ban single-use plastics in its venues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of our beaches is paramount. Port Phillip is our greatest natural asset. One of the challenges facing Port Phillip is legal ambiguity about ownership and responsibility. My plan for our community is to bring together the Marine and Coastal Council and state and federal governments so that we can work together. We face broader challenges around sea level changes, sand movements and coastal erosion that need to be confronted as a united team. As I said when I first entered this place our environmental approach must prioritise reason, technological advancement and scientific endeavour to drive and care for our environment, and that's the plan I will work towards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealand is family and I welcome the deputy high commissioner, who is here with us today. They are 'fanau', as the Maori say. New Zealanders are more like us than anywhere else in the world. The atrocity in Christchurch was an attack on our family. Unimaginably, it was an attack undertaken by an Australian. We feel shock, we feel grief, we are stunned and shamed that he came from among us and grew up among us. He may be an Australian by birth and by law but his actions and beliefs betray all that is and forever will be Australian, and we denounce it absolutely. Our thoughts and our prayers, our love and support are only with those he attacked. Our Queen, who we share with our Kiwi cousins, once said this of New Zealanders: it is a country characterised by 'a sense of fairness and justice, a willingness to be outward looking and a natural compassion for others'âso true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has responded in kind. In recent weeks we have seen tens of thousands of acts of kindness. There have been prayers not just in mosques but in churches, synagogues and temples all around our country and in the quiet homes, I'm sure, of Australians. The silver fern shone on our opera house, expressing our solidarity across the ditch. Our flags were lowered, including above us here in this very chamber. Schoolchildren did drawings and wrote letters sharing their sadness. Our Muslim community here reached out, many travelling to New Zealand to assist their brethren and their sisters. At a government-to-government level we have provided every assistance you would expect us to and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealand, of course, has first-class police, medical staff and first responders, but the scale of what they faced was unimaginable. It would have overwhelmed any city, particularly a city the size of Christchurch, in Australia. Australia has provided that support, and I want to thank all of those agencies at state and federal levels who were so quick to respondâour police, forensic specialists, victim support officers and intelligence analystsâwhere it was needed. Even now I understand counsellors from the New South Wales ambulance service are there to help the first responders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout all of this we have stood together. Last Friday, led by the Governor-General, the Leader of the Opposition and I attended the memorial service in Christchurch, joined by Lady Cosgrove, Chloe and Jenny. We were all touched by the service, by the people we met and their resolute determination to answer hate with love. One survivor who I met, Mr Farid Ahmed, who spoke at the service, said probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard someone say under such horrendous circumstances. He didn't speak of revenge, hurt or loss, even though it was his own wife who had been killed by the terrorist whilst she sought to assist him. Instead, he spoke in the great tradition of the Abrahamic faiths of forgiveness and he said he forgivesâvery powerful words. That's what conquers evil. That's what conquers hate. That beautiful service affirmed what we knew: that understanding will conquer division, that tolerance will always conquer fear and that love will always triumph overall. That powerful ethos reflected what I had seen in Australia when I met with Muslim leaders, including the mufti, the day after the Christchurch atrocity. Naturally there is deep and profound grief, but with grief there must also come reflection and answers. We owe that to all of those afflicted. The terrorist did live amongst us for just 45 days over the past three years. It is quite apparent that he acquired this vile radicalisation as he toured the world on a pilgrimage of hate and intolerance that met in the most tragic events for those victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else must be done to keep people safe? Of course we have asked those questions and have been answering them. How do we stop social media being weaponised by terrorists? We have been responding to that question as well. We must again, as we do right now, reaffirm what we as Australians believe and the society we stand for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This House knows, and I believe would shareâI would hopeâour commitment to religious freedom. It starts with the right to worship and to meet safely without fear. It means not looking over your shoulder or hiding who you are as you sit down to pray. It means to live without ridicule, to live without mocking for your beliefs and to live without violence or discrimination. Each day this House meets, it opens with a prayer. Long may that continue. Let our prayers now be for understanding, for restoration and for resolve to defy the hate and to focus on what we share, to understand, appreciate and respect the difference between us all and to perhaps agree more but to always disagree better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of all extremismâreligious, secular or politicalâis the inability to tolerate difference, a hatred of difference, and a hatred about the choices of others. We must strive to see the 'us' in our national life and to celebrate it, an Australian 'us' of different faiths, of different ethnicities, of different ages, genders and sexualities, an Australian 'us' that rejects the hate, the blame and contempt that grip too much of modern debate. So we pause today, and we remember and we reflect, and we resolve to renew the bonds between us. Eight centuries ago, the Muslim poet and scholar Rumi said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We may know who we are or we may not. We may be Muslims, Jews or Christians but until our hearts become the mould for every heart we â¦ see only our differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">May this be a time when our hearts do mould together and where we remind ourselves of our similarities, for this is the best way we honour the 50 souls no longer with us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words, and I support what he was saying. When we look out the front of this building, we can see all the way down Anzac Parade, and, along that broad boulevard, carrying a name sacred to both Australia and New Zealand, we can see the monuments to the conflicts and the peacekeeping efforts of generations past. At the very far end, when we stand at the entrance of parliament and look down Anzac Parade, we see the War Memorial. Etched in stone and metal, there are the names of battlefields right through the decades where Australians and New Zealanders have fought side by side and fallen side by side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, at this end of Anzac Parade, I'd ask you to perhaps look, when you next travel past it, at the two bronze sculptures. These are striking metal arcs. They're both more than 11 metres tall. Perhaps, as we drive, we don't fully notice them. They actually represent the two handles of a kete. This is a traditional Maori basket woven from flax. I think this sculpture speaks for the old and deep and enduring relationship between Australia and New Zealand. It's right in front of our eyes as we walk out the front of parliament. It speaks to the enduring relationship, because, when times are tough, when the burden is heavy, your friends and your family lend a hand. We walk alongside each other, sharing the weight. We help each other carry the load.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Governor-General and Lady Cosgrove, the Prime Minister and Jenny, Chloe and I went to Christchurch last week to share our love and our sorrow and our solidarity, to pay our respects to the memory of 50 innocent people murdered at their Friday prayers, people at their most vulnerable and humble, children as young as three and four years old. We went to salute the courage of the first responders, the people who worked hardâunimaginable, really, to think about itâstaunching wounds, saving lives, and to bring perpetrators to justice. We went to offer our own words of comfort and condolence to the injured and the frightened, to those grappling with the loss of someone you love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, all of us in our parliament send the same message to the people of New Zealand: we are here to help you carry the burden of grief and to shoulder and share the weight of sadness, because our two nations are not just friends; we are family. We are one. The New Zealand poet Jenny Bornholdt once described the Tasman Sea as a bridge of faith between our nations. That is what we need now more than ever, not just a bridge of faith between our nations but a bridge between faiths, a bridge of understanding and respect, compassion and community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Christchurch service, Chloe and I spoke to Farid. Farid Ahmed and his wife, Hosne, were in separate rooms at the Al Noor Mosque when the shooting started. Hosne was teaching classes there. She helped lead a group of women and children out to safety. Farid, who uses a wheelchair, couldn't flee. Hosne, his wife of 25 years, ran back into the mosque to try to save him. She was shot and killed. Farid survived. He told the crowd at the memorial that he could not hate the gunman; he had to love him. He said: 'I cannot deny the fact that he is my human brother. Each human being is my brother, my sister.' I'm not sure I could have said what he said. I'm not sure many of us could. But if someone who actually heard the shots, witnessed the deaths and lost the love of his life can find it in his heart to spread a message of peace and unity and healing, then all of us can rise up to that example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think every Australian would agree that Prime Minister Ardern has shown exceptional leadership in the most difficult of circumstances: the decisive action she's taken on gun control and, equally, the hard, important work of unity, inclusion and healing. She's reached out to the families in mourning and to the broader Muslim community. She said so powerfully on the day of the shooting: 'They are us'. But the hard truth that we've had to confront in Australia is that the gunman, the killer, the individual who walked into the mosque and murdered people at their prayer, at their most humble and vulnerable, came from among us. He was an Australian citizen. It's a phrase that I didn't ever expect to use: an Australian terrorist. It's a phrase that still sounds wrong. But I think Christchurch has presented us all with an uncomfortable truth, because when acts of violence, of evil, of terrorism are committed by people from other faiths and backgrounds, including but not limited to people of the Muslim faith, a lot of people are very quick to judge that whole faith by the actions of the individualâto demand that everyone of that faith in our community must condemn those acts. A lot of people are too quick to tar everyone with the actions of demented, deranged individuals. But when the terrorist is an Australian of Anglo Saxon background, we say 'He's deranged. He was an isolated exception'âand that is true. We know straight away that, as the Prime Minister so forcefully said, 'He does not represent anything about our country or our values.' Perhaps that should give us all pause the next time we rush to judgement. Perhaps that should remind us not to equate whole communities with the random, senseless violent acts of individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's something else that I think we must reflect on. The Christchurch gunman wasn't born wanting to kill. He wasn't born hating people because of the God they prayed to. Somewhere he grew to learn that hatred, that violence, that evil. He was able to find allies in that extremism. He was able to have it reinforced and normalised and focused. This is another confronting truth for Australia. We have understood for a long time that we are not immune from the consequences of terrorism. Far too many Australians have died here and around the world for us to imagine that we enjoy some form of special protection or immunity. But we have perhaps indulged in the belief that terrorism is always caused and created elsewhere, that somehow extremism and hatred and the violence they incite can only ever be brought in from overseas. But that is not true. Racism and prejudice and discrimination still live among us. Yes, social media is a new part of this problemâthe cowardly anonymous bile of trolls, the conspiracy theorists feeding each other's paranoia. I agree with the government that the social media operators absolutely have a responsibility to be more diligent, more accountable and more vigilant in policing the dark corners of their platforms. But it is not just new media and social media platforms; sometimes it can be in traditional media tooâthe uncritical exposure and massive platform given to people on the fringe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond new media and old media is the national conversation, the public square. Simply put, there are no bystanders when it comes to calling out racism and no disinterested observers on the question of prejudice and hatred. We all carry a responsibility. As we gather on the eve of an election, perhaps it brings a special responsibility to all of us. In the light and heat of a campaign, people under pressure can reach for convenient scapegoats and durable stereotypes, using the other as the easy answer to a hard question, tempted by the motivating power of fear. Christchurch stands as a warning, a lesson and a reminder that, if one plays with the poison politics of racism, if we encourage majorities to pick on minorities, if we try and whip up fear about people who worship different gods and if we try and pretend that all of the problems in this country can be blamed on the people who happened to arrive last, we forfeit the right to be shocked when the worst of consequences occurs. Not all extreme right-wing hate speech ends in terror and racial violence, but all terror and racial violence begins in extreme hate speech. If you create a swamp of extremism and prejudice and legitimise it, you cannot disown what crawls out of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christchurch was an unspeakable tragedy, but out of that darkness comes inspiration, stories of courage, lessons about humanity and insight into the hearts of the people of New Zealand. The fact is that these moments present choices for peoples and nations. We can retreat into division, we can fall back on hatred and suspicion, we can diminish ourselves with arguments about blame and false equivalence or we can use this as a moment to reflect, examine ourselves and ask: 'Are we doing all that we can do to call out the hate and the racism?' We need to remind ourselves that words do matter. Words can be weapons and words can incite people to pick up a weapon. I think we can afford to ask ourselves, as we support the comments of the Prime Minister: what can we do better than we have been doing? What can we do better than we have been doing up to this point? It is a task worthy of the parliament and it is a task worthy of our great nation and our Australian people to remember the lessons today and mourn with those who've lost so much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their remarks. I also welcome the Deputy High Commissioner of New Zealand and join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in doing that. Briefly, as members would expect, I've been in touch with a good friend of many in this chamber, including myself, and a good friend of Australia, and that's the Right Hon. Trevor Mallard, the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. As you'd expect, myself and the President of the Senate wrote to him on behalf of all members and senators. I have a brief message from him that I said I'd convey to the House:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As a country, we were all deeply shocked and heartbroken by the horrific act of terrorism and hate carried out on our soil on Friday, 15 March. The outpouring of love and generosity displayed over the past few weeks has shown that, no matter one's religion, ethnicity or country of birth, New Zealanders will not tolerate violence or extremism of any kind. We will continue to be proud of our multicultural and inclusive society and continue to promote these values to the world. On behalf of the New Zealand parliament I want to thank you, your parliamentary colleagues and Australians generally for your support and solidarity. It is certainly a comfort to know we are not alone in our sense of loss. We shall hold your sympathy and support close as we continue to grieve, support the victims, their families and our cherished Muslim communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 25 February 2019, of the Honourable Dr John Joseph Herron AO, a former Minister and Senator for the State of Queensland from 1990 to 2002, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr John Herron was a surgeon, a parliamentarian and a true humanitarian. John Herron was a man of faith and a man of great compassion. The Bible speaks of those who repair the ruins, and those restorers are called 'the repairers of the breach'. Repairing the breachesâthat's what he did in this place, that's what he did throughout his life, and that's what he especially did in Rwanda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Herron's kindness was legendary around this place. It was to John Herron, the doctor-turned-senator, that so many MPs and senators turned in the most difficult moments of their lives. He supported Labor MP Con Sciacca through the devastating loss of his 19-year-old son to cancer, and they went on to work together to support other families facing similar tragedies. When Cheryl Kernot lost her house in an arson attack in 1991, it was John Herron who reached out. Of course, John had understood what to say and do because he had watched his own house burn to the ground in 1967, leaving his family with literally just the clothes on their backs. He didn't let this place change his very essence. He was always a doctor, a father, a Catholic, a Queenslanderâalways trying to be authentic all the time in his life. It's why he was trusted by all in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Herron's greatest achievements, though, I don't believe were in this building, though those achievements are many and deserving of honour; they were on another continent, in Africa, in Rwanda. It was during 1994, while driving, that Senator Herron heard on the radio that Care Australia was looking for doctors to volunteer in Rwanda, a nation ravaged by one of the worst genocides in modern historyâa million dead in a genocide against the Tutsi people. Rather than, as he put it, sitting around in opposition in the Senate doing nothing, he made the life-changing decision to spend the next two months in Rwanda. He saw the unimaginable, the unspeakable. He saw man's inhumanity to others. He saw murder. He saw genocide. He saw hell itself as best it can be replicated in this world. He spoke of seeing the bodies of thousands of people machine-gunned in a sports field and trucks gathering the bodies. There was cholera and dysentery. There were thousands of orphans, children as young as three, numbed by what they had seen. He experienced abject terror when child soldiers aimed their AK-47s at him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Herron came back to Australia a changed man, traumatised indeed by what he had witnessed. He would go on to become a fierce advocate for the establishment of the International Criminal Court. But he also suffered what he then called a nervous breakdown, crying at night and weeping for no reason. Indeed, it was PTSD. The doctor who had given so much to others paid a high price himself for his compassion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Herron was in many ways an accidental politician. He considered himself apolitical. As he put it: 'I never took any interest in anything outside. I didn't read the newspaperâno politics, nothing.' But, after asking a question of a Labor politician at a meeting and feeling like he got fobbed off, John Herron joined the Liberal Party. He served the party and, in time, the nation with great distinction. He was President of the Liberal Party in Queensland twice. He was a senator for Queensland for 12 years. As Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the Howard government, he focused on and championed improving the health outcomes for Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's service to Australia did not end when he retired from the Senate in 2002. He served as Australia's Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See and continued to champion medical causes throughout Australia. One cause he was particularly passionate about was Down syndrome. He was instrumental in establishing Down Syndrome Queensland after his first child, Maryann, was born with that condition. John Herron touched the lives of people across at least two continents. His dedication to serving others, his love for his family and his country, and his enduring compassion for people everywhere serve as an inspiration to us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Jan, and their nine surviving children, as well as their extended family. To John Herron, we simply say: thank you for your service.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  On behalf of the opposition, I join with the Prime Minister and the government in offering our condolences to John Herron's many dear friends and colleagues, and all the members of the mighty Herron clan. John Herron lived a long life full of accomplishmentsâa surgeon, a senator, a cabinet minister and Australia's Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy Seeâbut he always said that his greatest achievements were his marriage and his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparation for these remarks, I reached out to Nick HerronâNick and Naomi Herron are very good friends of Chloeâand I asked what would be his words about his father. He said that his father really enjoyed his time in politics. He thought it was public service, and he did cherish friendships across the political aisle, including the late Con Sciacca.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Herron came to parliament relatively late in an already distinguished life. A highly regarded surgeon, from his very first speech, he always spoke with clarity, authority and passion about the challenges facing Australia's health system. For example, he undeniably influenced a generation of parents about young people and the effects of alcohol on developing brains. He used his considerable knowledge of science and medicine to unpack the competing claims of lobbyists and interest groups. Of course, John Herron was a very proud, very loyal and fierce Liberal, not just through his two terms in the Senate but also through his two stints as president of the Queensland Liberal Partyâa job I am sure that made him miss the relaxing atmosphere of the operating theatre!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our adversarial democracy, when the time comes to pay tribute to party warriors from either side, I believe we owe them the respect of our continuing disagreement. I can't imagine that John Herron would want Labor people seeking to minimise the philosophical differences. He wouldn't want us to try and blur the sharp lines of distinction on policy that he could seek to draw. But his views were not adopted from convenience or crafted for an audience; they were drawn from a deep well of principle and faith. You need only to look at his work in Rwanda to understand how firmly he believed in helping others and to get a glimpse of that resilience amongst adversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are many sitting opposite who knew him very well and I understand your sense of loss. He was always courteous, civil and good humoured in his parliamentary contributions, with an avuncular exterior that had steel underneath it.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first and second Howard governments, Senator Herron served as minister for Indigenous affairs. Labor did not always agree with his decisions, but no-one could ever question the sincerity of his views, the depth of his convictions or the determination with which he pursued them. Interestingly, I noticed that when Senator Herron announced his retirement in a brief and typically affable way, the Leader of the Government, Senator Hill, rose to respond saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a minister he got the short straw, some might say, in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, which was always seen as one of the most difficult of portfolios.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I submit that Senator Herron never viewed Aboriginal affairs as the short straw, precisely because he knew it was one of the most difficult portfolios. He didn't come to public life seeking an easy ride. He came to do difficult things, because he knew, as we all do, that the toughest things are the ones which make the biggest differences. We salute his service to Australia. May he rest in peace.</span>

Les Carlyon was a master of words. He helped Australians understand ourselves and our national story. On Gallipoli, the Great War, on the track and on the events of the day, he knew what to say. There seemed to be nothingâno person, no street scene, no world event, no horror, no </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">joyâthat he couldn't capture. Of the great horse trainer Bart Cummings, Les wrote that his eyebrows 'were </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">a creeper in search of a trellis</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">'. Perhaps he could have said that about one other holder of the office I now holdâand I am sure he wouldn't mind the reference! On political correctness, he said that it was 'to look at the world through a keyhole not a big bay window'.</span></span>

                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;" />
                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">He had words when words would fail most of us. This was never truer than when he turned his mind to chronicling some of the most turbulent and tragic events in Australia's historyâthe story of our First World War experiences at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. These were indeed epic works. Without them, today's Australians could never fully understand the horrors and lessons of the Great War and the sacrifice of 60,000 Australians made real for a whole new generation of Australians and generations to come. In those tomes, he never lost sight of the people who were at the centre of them. In </span>

                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> he contemplated those hundreds of thousands of young men and said, 'We never really saw them.' So Les helped us to see themâand to know them as well.</span>
                </span>

                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">Les died last month after a long illness, which apparently wasn't his preferred way to go. He used to say that he'd like to go by falling off a horse. He didn't get that wish. But he may have gotten the next best thing: he had his send-off at Flemington, a place that Les loved.</span>

And our sympathies go to his children, Richard, Patrick and Kate, and the wider Carlyon family. His pen may be down, his voice may now be silenced in this world, but his words will always stay with us. Australia has lost a fine son.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:37</span>):  In the weeks since Les Carlyon's passing, colleagues, proteges and admirers have all sought to find the words to say what he meant to them and our country. But, in truth, for Les, there will never be the right words. John Harms is a great sportswriter himself. He recalled the first time he picked up a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Chasing a Dream</span>. A phrase caught his eye on the first page, so he folded the corner down to mark the place. He then turned to page 2 and realised he couldn't fold the paper both ways. So John went to work with a pencilâthere were asterisks and square bracketsâmarking sections and making notes. I think that sums up Les Carlyon: magic in every sentence, a gem in every paragraph. He never spent a sentence in vain. There was artistry and craftsmanship in equal measure. There was nothing 'for the sake of it', though; there was no ornamentation in his writing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am lucky enough to be the member of parliament for Flemington and Moonee Valley race tracks. And Les wrote as he liked to see the horses raced: 'gamely, for speed, not overburdened by the science of strategy'âjust the right words. All his working life, Les possessed a brilliant knack for finding the right wordsâand a visceral loathing for the wrong ones. For example, he couldn't stand it when people spoke of racing as an industry. After all, he'd never heard anyone on a train home from Flemington talking about what a great day they'd had at the industry. As he put it: 'Packaging is an industry, yet no-one stands alongside the production line to applaud a cardboard box. No-one suggests a cardboard box has character.' Really, that was the essence of Les's work: characterâthe character of unfashionable, unstoppable winners like Vo Rogue; the character of Galleywood, who rose from his fall at the Warrnambool Cup like Lazarus on four legs; the character of wily trainers like Vic Rail or the brilliance of Bart. Les said that if Bart Cummings ever took up fishing, the trout would leap from the water to impale themselves on naked hooks. He wrote of the character of famous racersâof Kingston Town's third Cox Plate: down past the school, around the tight corner, moving in a few strides 'from has-been to immortal'âand through it all the character of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Great disservice is often done by people who compare sport to war, and in fact it takes a very special gift to write about both. Les was a great historian for the same reasons he was a wonderful sports journalist. He didn't blunder off into lazy cliches or indulge in cheap sentimentality. He didn't write backwards from a conclusion that he'd already formed. Les was an observer, a student of behaviour, someone who understood heart and passion and luck and triumph and disaster. He could see a deeper truth and share it with us all, whether it was watching Bonecrusher move into the gates, eavesdropping on Bob Hawke and Andrew Peacock exchanging pleasantries at the mounting out on derby day, or bringing to light the letters and diaries of diggers long gone, finding the humanity amongst the unimaginable death and devastation of Gallipoli and the Western Front, deriving for us some sense of what Australia truly lost on those battlefields and what we might yet gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember in 2016, when we were in this House marking the centenary of Australia's first battles on the Western Front, I rang Les and asked if he would look at the draft of some remarks I was preparing. I sent it through and waited with some anticipation for some of Les's vivid prose. He rang me up soon after and said: 'Thanks for that, Bill. It reads well. The Western Front was probably the worst tragedy Australia experienced. You might want to give some thought to all those healthy young men who came home missing a limb or disfigured or with their lungs ruined by gas.' That was it. For me, that was Les Carlyon: simple, profound observations and then another layer of insight, a different perspective, a more compelling angleâthe right words. His words will always be with us, and for that we should be grateful. May he rest in peace.</span>

Can I say very briefly, as someone who has read, like many members, his books on Gallipoli and on the Western Front, Les told the Anzac story like no other. Many have written of Anzac but none have done it better, in a more compelling or captivating way, than him. I've purchased those two books on many, many occasions. I think booksellers have wondered why I keep purchasing the same books; it's because they're regular history prizes.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has spent years making it harder for Australians to make ends meet. He's supported cutting penalty rates and jacking up taxes, like his $44 billion Medicare levy increase. After six years of cuts and chaos and just six weeks before an election, does the Prime Minister seriously expect his last-minute decision to copy Labor's bigger, better tax cuts for Australians will hide the last six years of cuts and chaos?</span>

That will never happen. This side of the House will never say that some people deserve tax cuts and other people deserve tax increases, because, on our side of the House, we believe that, when all Australians are working hard, all Australians deserve to keep more of what they earn. On this side of the House, we believe in the economics of aspiration, not the politics of envy and punishment that is pursued by the Labor Party as they run around seeking to drag people down, under the pretence that they're trying to lift others up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was wondering: what would be the point of Australians working hard under a Labor government? What would be the reward? What would be the point of starting a business? What would be the incentive to go out there and make that extra sacrifice? The harder you work under Labor, the harder it gets under Labor. The more you actually go out there and take risks to make Australia stronger and to make Australia the country it can be, the harder it gets under the policies of the Labor Party, who just want to tax you more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence of that is more than $200 billion in higher taxesâthat is what the Labor Party are proposing at the next electionâand I heard that the member for McMahon, with his chest all beefed up out there, was puffing away about how he would have to bring down another budget if he and the Labor Party were to be elected. Well, I'll tell you why they'd have to introduce another budget: because they'd have to increase taxes. That is what the Labor Party would need another budget for, because you won't find tax increases in our budget tonightâyou won't find that at all. But you'll find them thick and deep in the first Labor budget if that is ever to be inflicted on this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, what people will get tonight is the first surplus budget in 12 years. That's what they'll get tonight. The last time the Labor Party had a surplus was 1989. I had long curly hair back thenâthat's how long ago that was. It was a very long time ago. And, thankfully, the photos were in analog; they weren't in digital!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time that the Labor Party had any decent economic policies is beyond anyone's memory. So I can assure the member for McMahon: I won't be reading his little book of big fat taxes that he wants to put on the Australian people when it comes to setting the economic policy for this nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget that will be handed down tonight will be building our strong economy, to ensure we can secure Australians' future.</span>

I know he's excited, like everyone on this side of the House is excited, because, after 12 long years, Australia will be back in the black tonight when the Treasurer comes to this despatch box to hand down the first surplus budget in 12 years. It's been a long way back from when Labor was elected in 2007 and turned a $20 billion surplus into a $27 billion deficit in just 12 months. It's been a long way back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what that tells usâall the way back there when the member for Lilley became the Treasurerâis: you vote Labor once, you pay for it for more than a decade. That is the consequence, because, when Labor get into power, we know that they cannot manage money. You vote Labor once and you pay for it more for than a decade because the Labor Party propose to change it allâhigher taxes on families, higher taxes on retirees, higher taxes on businesses and higher taxes on Australians who just want to work hard and get ahead and provide for their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That surplus has been achieved by getting the budget under control, and it's been achieved by getting Australians back into work by building the strong economy which has ensured the highest growth in employment in a year that this nation has ever seen, with more than 1.2 million jobs created under the economic policies of this government. And what is the dividend of that? Guaranteed, delivered funding for essential services in health, in education, in pharmaceuticals, in disability care and in aged careâthat is the dividend of a strong economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not guarantee funding for essential services by increasing taxes. That is the false economy of the Labor Party, and that is the three-card trick they'll try and play on the Australian people. The plan that we have been implementing that has delivered a stronger economy and guaranteed record funding for essential services is the plan that you will continue to see tonight: a balanced budget; paying down debt; lower taxes on all Australians without increasing taxes on any Australians; backing small and family businesses; ensuring that we're taking all industry forward, whether it is our mining industries and agricultural industries or our new frontier industries in the health and medical instruments sector; and the infrastructure that both busts congestion and drives our economy forward. This budget will be delivering for the hardworking Australians who are making Australia stronger, and this budget is for them.</span>

The government has spent the last 12 months fighting Labor's bigger, better, fairer tax cuts. So, after six years of cuts and chaos and just six weeks from an election, does the Prime Minister seriously expect that his last-minute decision to imitate Labor's bigger, better, fairer tax cuts will con the Australian people into believing that the last six years of chaos, cuts and division didn't happen?</span>

We legislated a $144 billion personal-income-tax plan after the last budget, and the Labor Party want to reduce that by $70 billion. The Labor Party want to put up taxes on hardworking Australians. They want to put up taxes on retirees and people who have saved and paid taxes all their lives. The most insulting thing that the Labor Party have said about their appalling retirees tax is, 'They don't pay any tax.' These Australians have paid tax all of their lives, and this Leader of the Opposition wants to put a tax of $5 billion a year on retirees.</span>

                  </a>  because of their big carbon target. You can call it a carbon tax. You can call it a carbon price. All I know is that people are going to be paying more because of the reckless targets that the Labor Party want to put on everything that moves. They want to tell farmers what they can do on their property. They want to tell you what car you have to buy. This is a tax that is going to cost Australians in their wages $9,000 a year. This is what the Labor Party's reckless carbon target is going to do to our economy. And, more than that, $36 billion of cost is going to be heaped on the businesses of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it takes a special form of genius for the Labor Party to come up with a tax that doesn't even pay to the government. Under the member for Lilley, we had the mining tax that didn't raise any revenue. That was a special form of Labor genius. But $36 billion of forcing companies to buy foreign carbon credits from Kazakhstan or somewhere else. How are businesses going to pay higher wages if they have to pay foreign carbon traders $36 billion? This is a tax on everything that moves, and the Leader of the Opposition can't even explain the details of it. He's had 5Â½ years to explain to the Australian people how he is going to meet his reckless 45 per cent emissions reduction target. Well, the simple answer is this: he's going to make Australians pay more for absolutely everything.</span>

                  </a>  Tonight's budget is all going to be about infrastructure. The age of infrastructure is upon us. The age of infrastructure is here. We've already rolled out $75 billion and there is going to be more. I tell the member for Flynn that the eight councils in his electorate are going to benefit from a recordâa part of the $2.2 billion investment in road safety. We all know how important road safety isâ$2.2 billion, including Roads to Recovery. For the 537 councils across Australia, many of them in Labor electorates, this is going to be so beneficial. For the eight councils in Flynn, that will roll out better roads, getting people home sooner and safer, as the member for Flynn asked about. That's what it is all about: making sure they can get home to loved ones and spend less time in congested traffic. Whether they are in Gladstone or in Melbourne or wherever they are right across this nation, it is making sure that people have road safety provisions. It is delivering for the people of Gladstone in the budget tonight. The Liberals and Nationals have committed up to $100 million to upgrade road access to Queensland's largest multicommodity port of Gladstone. It's a busy portâI've been there recently. We want to make it even more busy. Gladstone residents will benefit from fewer heavy freight traffic vehicles on our local roads. The budget is going to address the safety concerns caused by heavy vehicles interacting with local and general commuter traffic, as well as supporting more efficient movement along key freight supply chains. This is big news for the big employing industries in Gladstone, big news for agriculture and big news for the mining sector. They are writ large in Flynn and the member for Flynn backs them all the way.</span>

Maths is certainly not the member for Sydney's strong suitânor is geography, for that matterâbecause what the member for Sydney has done is come in here and do what the Labor Party always does before an election: speak total mistruths to the Australian people. It may be of some interest to the member for Sydney that recurrent funding from the Commonwealth government for government schoolsâstate schoolsâfrom 2013 to now has increased by 57 per cent. Only under the member for Sydney's arithmetic would an increase in funding of that order be constituted as a reduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets better than that. The forecast in our spending plans is to increase funding for schools in her own electorate of Sydney by 60 per cent. So how does the member for Sydney parade herself around the country, pretending to be someone of economic competence, which is quite a stretch, even in the Labor Party, when these most simple issues of arithmetic are beyond her? Under our government, under our economy, where we have put in place the processes and policies to support Australians to go out there and work hard and make the economy strong, we have record funding of state schools and independent schools, and that record funding increases out into the medium term. So I say to the Australian people: don't be swindled by the mistruths of the Labor Party. Do you remember what they said before the last election? They said we were going to sell Medicare. Today, Medicare has the highest level of funding and the highest level of bulk-billing in Australia's history. Under our government, Medicare has never been stronger in this country. Under the Labor Party, all you will get is falsehoods and mistruths. Don't be conned by Labor.</span>

Haven't the LNP and ALP's free markets seen exports skyrocketing? The motor vehicle industry has been exported. Clothing and footwear have been exported. Petrol has been exported. Whitegoods have been exported. Half the seafood, pork and vegetable industries have been exported, as has 25 per cent of our electricity. Coalminers' and power workers' jobs have gone to Chinese solar factories. Minister, is there going to be a royal commission? To meet imports, haven't we sold 83 per cent of our minerals, 93 per cent of our coal seam gas, our airports, our coal ports and the five biggest farms in the land? It is corporate colonisation. Are the ALP and LNP on the take or just plain stupid?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. Respectfully, I would say the answer to his question is no. But I have to say, as this is my last week of question time, that there are many things that I am going to miss about this place, and one of the things that I will miss is the questions from the member for Kennedy. He has a wonderful way of combining Aussie vernacular with haiku poetry. So I'm going to do my very best to address the theme of his question, which is the Australian economy and the coalition's plan for our economy. The coalition's economic plan for our economy is delivering lower taxes, a growing economy and, of course, a record number of jobs in this country. And I'm proud to report to the House that we have a record number of Australians in work now, more than at any other time in our history. We have, under our economic stewardship, seen more than 1.2 million jobs created in this country, and the majority of those jobs have in fact been full-time jobs. And I'm very proud to be able to report to the House that, over the past 12 months, we have seen around 300,000 jobs created and, of those jobs created, three-quarters of them have been full-time jobs. It is a great credit to the economic plan that we have put in place which has seen that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen unemployment drop now to a number that has a '4' in front of it: 4.9 per cent. Again, it is due to the hard work and effort of the coalition team on this side of the chamberâa team that, of course, has lowered taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can invest in their businesses and so that they can employ fellow Australians. In fact, 98 per cent of all businesses in this country are small and medium-sized enterprises, including farmers, and they employ around seven million Australians. Part of our economic plan has been to deliver free trade agreements that open up new export markets for those farmers, for those small and medium-sized enterprises. Free trade agreements with China, with South Korea, with Japan and with Hong Kong; closer economic relations, of course, with Singapore, with India and with Indonesia; and the Trans-Pacific Partnership are all delivering so that we can see new markets available to people who are working hard here in Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr PORTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  As the member is aware, the utterly tragic events in Christchurch demonstrated that the tools that can now be used by terrorists to spread fear, violence and messages of fanatical hate are not limited, very sadly, to guns. The role that social media, and in this case particularly Facebook, played in those tragic events is one that deserves scrutiny and condemnation and a response from this parliament. That's particularly the case because the abject failure of social media, and particularly the platform of Facebook to properly control the content on its own platform, where Facebook makes enormous profit in the business of content provision, is something that needs attention and a response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous events have included, for the benefit of the House: in March 2017, Facebook broadcast live the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl in the United States by multiple assailants; in April 2017, Facebook broadcast the murder in the United States of 74-year-old Robert Goodwin, and the murder was able to be viewed on Facebook for three hours; and Facebook is also responsible for the showing of two videos of a man in Thailand killing his 11-month-old daughter, which were available for 24 hours before being removed and were viewed over 370,000 times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In specific relation to the Christchurch footage, which depicted astonishing violence of the most atrocious typeâmotivated by, as we know, and designed to spread fanatical far-right extremismâthe footage started in a live stream broadcast at 1.33 pm and it live streamed for 17 minutes until 1.50 pm. The originally posted footage continued to be available, viewed, downloaded and forwarded until 2.40 pm, some 72 minutes after it started live streaming. Notwithstanding that a complaint had been received by Facebook through its own mechanisms on its own platform at the 29-minute mark, Facebook offered no information to the Prime Minister last week in a meeting and offered no evidence or indication that they took any proper notice or action, even on the complaint available on their own system at the 29-minute mark. In fact, it appears that Facebook did precisely nothing until the intervening event of New Zealand police contacting Facebook at 2.31 pm, 63 minutes after the live streaming commenced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing perhaps more concerning than the abject failure by Facebook to control the content of its own platform is the legal fact that there is not any sufficient recourse for this parliament if such a failure occurs in the future in Australia. Content providers and hosts can no longer be reckless as to the presence of that type of abhorrently violent material. The time to pass a law to make that so is this week, and the time to pass a law that says that content servers should suffer the most serious penalties for failing to expeditiously remove abhorrently violent material is this week.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  This matter is definitely one of public importance. At the end of yet another angry summer, as the community are telling all members of parliament that they expect their national parliament to do so much better, there couldn't be a matter of public importance more deserving of debate in the parliament this afternoon. There is a surge in community consciousness and expectation around climate change that I've not seen since 2007 at the earliest. I know that members opposite are hearing this as well. It's why so many of them are rebadging themselves as moderate Liberals. It's why so many of them are conducting pre-selection battles between the Left and the Right about climate change policy. People all around the country are seeing the impacts of climate change, have seen them right through this angry summer and are asking the question: why, after six years of this government, are we going backwards?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know; they've heard from the scientists that 2018 was one of the five hottest years on record around the worldânot an El Nino year, so quite outstanding in meteorological termsâthe other four being 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Australians have seen the angry summer unfold over the course of the last few months. We've just been told it was the hottest summer on record. The bureau only released its data over the last several hours that this March was the hottest March on record. In South Australia, my home state, we had the hottest summer on record, the hottest month on record and the hottest day on record. Two hundred and nine weather records were broken over the course of this summer. There were floods in places that don't usually flood. There were fires in places that don't usually burn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community understand that climate change is unfolding around them, while this government does absolutely nothing. They saw the reports from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO just before Christmasâtheir two-yearly report on the state of the climateâoutlining in great detail the impact that just one degree of warming is already having on our vulnerable continent, which already pushes us to the limits of human tolerance: an extended and a more intense fire season; structural reductions in stream flow and rainfall in our prime agricultural regions like the Murray-Darling Basin and the south-west of Western Australia; sea level rise accelerating because of the dramatic acceleration in the melting rates, particularly of the Greenland ice sheets. All these records and evidence have been rejected by the inaction of those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also reflected in the scientific advice that we've received over the last 12 months at a global level. The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, confirmed that, with two degrees of global warmingâtoo often regarded as a relatively safe level of global warmingâmore than 99 per cent of the world's coral reefs will be destroyed, including the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo. With just two degrees of global warming, the World Bank tells usâand the member for Kennedy will be interested in thisâglobal cereal production will be reduced by 20 per cent. On a continent like Africa, which is expected to experience almost all of the net population growth around the world over the next few decades, cereal production would be reduced by 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, against all of this evidence, this government has done nothing, and we have gone backwards on every single indicator on climate change and energy policy. Pollution has started to go up. Renewable energy investment in the first 12 months of the member for Warringah's prime ministership collapsed by 88 per centâa cause for celebration, I'm sure, by this Minister for Energy, who has built a career opposing renewable energy. We are now the only country in the OECD that doesn't have fuel efficiency standards. We have the lowest uptake of electric vehicles in the OECD. It's good enough for the United States, good enough for Canada and good enough for the UK, Japan, Western Europe, China and so many other nations of the world, but apparently not good enough for this coalition party room to agree upon. They cannot agree on a single serious measure being adopted around the world on climate changeânot a single measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to the issue of two degrees Celsius. The advice from all of the experts and scientists is that our position on emissions reduction is the minimum position consistent with keeping global warming below two degreesânet zero emissions by the middle of the century, and a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030. Even a 45 per cent cut will still use up more than three-quarters of Australia's remaining carbon budget between now and 2050, but it is the minimum position consistent with the responsibility that our generation of Australians around this country has to look after the interests of our children, our grandchildren and generations beyond. That is why we are taking the right position to this electionâan election that we expect, in significant part, will be fought on climate change policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we announced the most comprehensive climate change action plan ever taken to a federal election by a major party, building on the energy policy announcements that we made last year; building on our 50 per cent commitment to renewable energy by 2030, which independent modelling says will create 70,000 additional jobs; and building on the commitment we have to help households tap into new technology like household batteriesâa $200 million program to assist 100,000 households purchase household batteries to complement the two million sets of solar panels we already have on Australian household roofs, to bring down power prices after power bills have gone up and up under this government and to start to make their contribution to improving the environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the moderate Liberals faction walking out on a climate change debate in this parliament because they are so ashamed of what this energy minister and all of his many predecessors in the climate change and energy portfolio have done to this country's record on looking after the interests of our children, our grandchildren and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy we announced yesterday also builds on our visionary hydrogen policy, which the member for Shortland particularly worked on so hard over the last few months. We are going to hear from him and from the member for Bass, who has also been a strong advocate of Tasmania's placeâparticularly northern Tasmania's placeâin the hydrogen economy of the future, an economy in which Australia can be a leader and create, like renewable energy, thousands and thousands of jobs. This is an industry that the government's Minister for Resources and Northern Australia said is decades away. But everyone who has looked at this industry understands that this is a jobs and investments boom opportunity for a country like Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we announced policies to bring down industrial pollution among the 250 biggest polluters in the Australian business community by putting in place the National Energy Guaranteeâby continuing the safeguards mechanism that was introduced under Malcolm Turnbull, a policy developed by Tony Abbott and continued by the current Prime Ministerâin the hope that, once the people occupying these ministries move on to whatever they are going to move on to, there might be a hope for the sort of bipartisanship that has acted as a foundation for serious action on climate change in every other democracy that is dealing with this issue around the planet. We have also announced the first ever electric vehicle policy in this country, to deal with the fact that we rank last on electric vehicle uptake in the OECD. We are the only OECD country without fuel efficiency standards. We have to change that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what did we get in response from this government? Like Pavlov's dog, all of those opposite pull out the old 'member for Warringah playbook', a carbon taxâa war on lunch boxes, a war on meat pies! Sausages are going up! Ten years ago the premium end of the meat market was under attack; this year it's the smallgoods! There won't be any night-time sport. Never mind that, even under the carbon price mechanism, 99.99 per cent of products marketed by Woolworths did not change one jot; even under the so-called carbon tax, 99.9 per cent of grocery items did not change in price whatsoever. This is all they've got. After 5Â½ years of inaction that has seen jobs and investment collapse, pollution go up and Australia move to the bottom of the pack on every possible index in this area, all they've got is the tired old scare campaigns that the member for Warringah came up with. The Australian people aren't going to put up with this for much longer. They've seen the impacts of climate change and they want a government that is committed to taking action in the interests of our children.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  The MPI mentions 'lower power prices', but I haven't heard a word from the member for Port Adelaide about lower power prices, because he doesn't want to talk about the costings from yesterday's policies. He doesn't want to explain to the Australian people what the impacts will be. We know the impacts though. I'm going to come back to those impacts and I'm going to watch you squirm as I describe the impacts of your policies on the Australian peopleâon tradies, on families, on hardworking small businesses. But before I do that, I want to talk about lower power prices and keeping the lights onâsomething that the shadow minister and those opposite don't seem to want to talk about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that Australians have been struggling with the cost of living. We understand that the governments in South Australia and Victoria, with their reckless targets, have not been able to keep the lights on. With that in mind, we have taken action on lower power prices and keeping the lights on. Our plan for fairer, more affordable and reliable power includes a price safety net to protect customersâa price safety net under the default market offer. We saw, under pressure from the government, the big energy companies reduce their standing offers on 1 Januaryâ$200 in New South Wales, $313 in Victoria, $272 in South Australia and $175 in south-east Queensland. But we need them to go further. The most vulnerable customers are the ones who deserve this most because they are paying a loyalty tax to the big energy companies who do the wrong thing. From 1 July, there will be price caps in place for those standing offers, and that will mean savings of up to $174 for customers on flat rate tariffs, $218 for residential customers on controlled load tariffs and almost $1,000 for small businesses. Those opposite wouldn't understand this. None of them have worked in a small business. But we do understand that. A thousand dollars is a big deal. It is a big deal for people who work in small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, we are driving new supply into the marketplace, putting $1.4 billion into Snowy 2.0âa battery for Australia with a cost of storage equal to a fiftieth of a Tesla battery. This will make sure we keep the lights on, because what we've seen is the governments in South Australia and Victoria setting insane renewable energy targets without understanding that, when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, you have to have backupâyou have to have storage. And that's why we're building Snowy 2.0.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, we saw only a couple of weeks ago a report coming from the Victoria Energy Policy Centre about the impact of manipulation of the market by the big energy companies. When the Hazelwood closure was announced, we saw what the major energy players did. AGL in particular doubled its bids into the market for its coal-fired power stations. It doubled them overnight. And the cost to Australian households and businesses was $3.5 billion in the next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation to prohibit that behaviour, to make that impossible, to make it illegal, was blocked by those opposite 12 timesâ12 times! You have to ask yourself: why is it that they stand on the side of the big energy companies? Why is it that they're backing the big energy companies? Might it be that the Queensland Labor government owns the big energy companies and withdrew $1.65 billion from their piggy bank last year to try to make ends meet? Even then they couldn't get to a surplus, because those who sit opposite don't do surpluses; they're not into them. But the Queensland government triedâ$1.65 billionâand absolutely failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside that, when we arrived in government, we saw that we were 755 million tonnes behind where we needed to be to reach our 2020 Kyoto obligations. We had to find an abatement of 755 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in order to reach our 2020 obligations. That's the deficit those opposite left us with. Alongside the debt and deficits on the fiscal side, they left us a debt and deficit on the emissions side. We've turned that around, in recent years, from a 755-million-tonne deficit to a 367-million-tonne surplusâ1.1 billion tonnes of turnaround on the emissions between 2010 and 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will smash the 2020 Kyoto obligations. We will absolutely smash them, on the latest numbers from the department, by 367 million tonnes. We announced only a few weeks ago how we'll reach the remaining 328 million tonnes we need to achieve for the time period between 2020 and 2030, and we'll achieve that through the $3Â½ billion Climate Solutions Fund, including the energy efficiency initiatives worth over 50 million tonnes, and of course the Emissions Reduction Fund, with $2 billion committed, which will deliver 102 million tonnes of abatement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite announced yesterday not a plan but a tax. They refused to outline the costs of their tax. They want to send your dollars offshoreâcarbon credits for Kazakhstan! They want to tell you what sort of car you can drive. They want to tell farmers what they can do with their land. And they want to bring back the Rudd-Gillard carbon tax. We stand for Snowy 2.0; those opposite stand for carbon tax 2.0.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent modelling by BAEconomicsâan adviser to the Hawke-Keating governments and a contributor to three IPCC reportsâshows that Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target will cost the economy $472 billion, will slash more than 336,000 jobs, particularly in the member for Shortland's electorateâthat's where they'll go fastestâwill cut the average wage of a worker by $9,000 and will increase wholesale electricity prices by more than 58 per cent. That's alongside increases in the price of cars, fuel, food and everything else that uses energy. The sad reality is that, when you want to whack a tax on energy, everything that has energy in it costs more. That is the reality: everything that has energy in it costs more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2016 Centre for International Economics report, which looked at Labor's policies on the vehicle side, concluded that an average vehicle would increase in cost by up to $5,000. They're not explaining that to the Australian people, nor are they explaining what this means for the average Australian's car. A Toyota HiLux, the most popular vehicle in Australiaâcertainly in my electorate it is very popular, and I'm sure it's popular in the electorates of a number of people behind meâemits 200 to 240 grams per kilometre. What are we going to do? Are the tradies going to be driving Priuses? What's going to happen to the SUV? You would think that if you bought an electric vehicle you might get by, but it turns outâwe did a bit of work on this earlier todayâthat a Tesla emits 178 grams per kilometre. So even a Tesla doesn't get there. So extraordinary is the shadow minister's policy that, when asked whether he was going to buy an electric car, he decided he wasn't going to answer the question. Well, he's quite right, because it's not going to reduce emissions. At 180 grams per kilometre, it's actually not going to help, but at least he understands that. He may, in the coming days before the election, fess up to the costs of your carbon tax, fess up to the costs of your policies and fess up to the impacts on the average Australian of your disastrous and absolutely inappropriate targetsâthe impacts they'll have on all of us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  What a pathetic effort from this generation's Bronwyn Bishopâtalking with great potential but underdelivering every single time. I'm going to start with one simple question. This is a debate about climate change. Where is the climate change minister? She's back in witness protection. They rolled her out yesterday for a 20-minute press conference where the Minister for Energy wouldn't let her answer a questionâmind you, I don't blame him after her performanceâand they rolled her back into witness protection. Such is the commitment of this government to climate change that the Minister for the Environment doesn't turn up for the debate. That is the truth of how little this government takes climate change seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a debate about a carbon taxâsureâbut there is only one carbon tax and that's their ridiculous Emissions Reduction Fund. They have spent $4 billion of taxpayers' money to pay polluters not to pollute. That is a carbon tax by any definition. Let's look at some of the projects. They're paying a goldminer $1 million to build a gas-fired plant that the goldminer says they would have built anyway. They're paying $2 million to Rio Tinto to put in a diesel generator that was commissioned before they opened their fund. They've already cancelled 28 per cent of the projects they're funding under the Emissions Reduction Fund. Malcolm Turnbull said that this fund, worth $4 billion now, is a fig leaf for doing nothing. That is their entire climate change policy: paying polluters not to pollute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the so-called Fisher modelling. This piece of work, which should have been written on toilet paper, because that is the quality of that piece of work, puts the cost of storage at $200 a megawatt hour, despite the fact that Snowy Hydro says the cost of renewable energy, plus the cost of storage, is 70 bucks a megawatt hour. This so-called modelling says that the $263 carbon price will drive 50 per cent renewable energy. It ignores the land sector. It is utter rubbish. I say this to the government: if they are going to rely on that modelling, what does it say about their policy? Their policy, under this modelling, is a $92 carbon price and involves a $90 billion hit to gross national income. That is what their chosen modelling says about their policy. It is absolutely ridiculous!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The absolute truth is the government do not care about taking action on climate change. Just look at the Prime Minister's contribution on this topic. Since entering parliament in 2007, guess how many times Prime Minister Morrison has mentioned climate change.</span>

The battery of the nation, on its own business case, only works if you get 50 per cent renewable energyâgone. The electric vehicle strategy doesn't exist. The final one is 100 million tonnes on technology improvements and other sources of abatement. They might as well have labelled that column 'blind faith'âblind faith that they'll suddenly find 100 million tonnes of abatement through some other method. That is the level of the government's contribution to this debate on climate change. </span>

By contrast, we have a reactionary government only interested in short-term politics, who history will condemn as horrible, horrible people that did not care about their kids' future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249764" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Children and Families</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  I must say that this is an interesting topic for those opposite to choose. The issue of a changing climate is a very big one and even bigger for the government of a small country to influence. Everyone knows that if Australia were to cut its emissions entirely, the planet's climate would not be altered. This would represent an enormous destruction of our quality of life and see the end of Australia as a world leader in anything. Climate change is a global issue and one that this Liberal-National government is acutely attuned to. We are going to meet our Paris targets in a canter, doing so without the extensive job losses that a carbon tax would deliver under a Labor government. We are doing our bit as a nation and will continue to do so in an entirely responsible manner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why do those opposite raise this topic this week? I'm afraid it's the old magician's trick: distraction. Those opposite simply don't want us to talk about tonight's budget, because it's going to open a wound they can't handle. Labor are terrified today of accidentally uttering the s-wordâsurplus! I can understand their reluctance. I wouldn't want to discuss something my side of politics had failed to deliver in the past 30 years. It must be a very sore point indeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder whether those opposite have ever wondered what it takes to deliver a surplus. I'm not sure that they would have. I am not the world authority on government budgets, but I do know a bit about balancing books. If you are in government and want to deliver a surplus, I'll tell you a couple of things that you don't do. You don't squash your revenue by introducing $200 billion in extra taxes on the economy that supports the nation. You don't demonise the resources sector that puts the food on the table for thousands of Queensland families and for state and federal governments. You don't skimp on delivering real job-creating infrastructure. You don't run off on vanity requests designed to satisfy the do-gooders in the almond-latte belt, at the expense of the livelihoods of the lifters of our nation, who bend their backs and produce something. And you don't write bogus cheques with borrowed money for programs with uncertain outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you may have heard that list and thought to yourself, 'Hey, these are all things that Labor do,' and you'd be correct. You'd also be correct to remember it was way back in 1989 when Labor last produced a budget surplus. Many in the gallery today, and even some in the staff ranks in this place, wouldn't remember that event. It has been a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so we come back to Labor's ridiculous failure on climate change. Those opposite no doubt think they are striking a blow by talking about renewable targets, electric cars and stopping emissions. This is not a climate plan; it is a climate tax, pure and simple. We already know that Labor's 45 per cent emissions target was going to result in a $9,000 hit to wages and more than 300,000 out of a job and that it was going to see wholesale electricity prices go up by 58 per cent. Now we know it will cost even more. Labor's vanity target could leave Australia $35 million poorer. I wonder whether those opposite are starting to realise why they never deliver budget surpluses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday's announcement by those opposite reeks of the lack of economic sense and the arrogance that we have come to expect from that side of politics. To think that one of our nation's leaders would pin his hopes to what fuel people will use in their cars is laughable. Has the Leader of the Opposition ever driven through Central Queensland? Communities like Middlemount, Dysart and Clarke Creek are not quite as close together as Canberra and Queanbeyan. Has he ever had to wait a week for power to be reconnected after a storm? These are the realities for many in my neck of the woods, and until such time as technology catches up with their needs Central Queenslanders need to keep the right to choose the vehicle that best suits them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm certainly not anti EVâit's quite exciting technology. I just can't see that those opposite have thought of all Australians when developing their policy. The saddest thing of all is that our hardworking coalminers have lost their jobs. After our farmers and graziers have had their production cut back to primitive levels and after households have been forced to disconnect from the power grid, it would all be for nothing. All of these measures put together won't make a jot of difference to the temperature of the planet. This is why Labor's plan is such a ridiculous one. It is tied up with spending money and signalling virtue instead of actually delivering outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite would rather ignore the truth than keep our economy strong so we can better ride out whatever blips come across our radar as a nation. This Liberal-National government is certainly not about to follow every whim of those opposite, and I'm proud to be part of a team that can get on with the job of creating jobs and, at the same time, looking after the environment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I rise to speak on Labor's plan for swift, comprehensive action on climate change, and I congratulate the member for Port Adelaide for the wonderful work he has done in his portfolio and in compiling this plan. We are experiencing a climate emergency. The year 2018 was one of the five hottest years on record around the world. The other hottest years were 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. There's a pattern here. In Australia, we experienced the hottest summer on record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again we are faced with statistics, reports and damning evidence of the results of this government's inaction on climate change. Under the coalition, we've seen six years of chaos and uncertaintyâsix years in which the climate emergency has worsened, putting us in a position where urgent action is required. The member for Warringah is, all of a sudden, a convert to the Paris accord. The member for Dickson, suddenly, is not wanting to fund any new coal-fired power stations. But this is not action; this is desperation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not a day passes when a constituent doesn't raise their concerns with me regarding climate change. From door-knocking residents, from street stalls, from talking to young kids at schools, from environment groups coming to see me in my office, from family and friends and through the hundreds and hundreds of emails I receive, I know that this is a key issue for those in my community and those around this country. It is one that people, even schoolchildren, feel compelled to take to the streets for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand here today to say that enough is enough. We cannot continue to have governments that ignore the science surrounding climate change, deny the reality of the emergency we are faced with and refuse to take action. Australia is screaming for leadership. It needs a government with a plan to reduce emissions while ensuring that we look after affected workers and communitiesâa plan to grow the economy, cut pollution and ensure that our future generations are left with a clean, healthy and safe environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud to stand here today as a member of the Labor Party, a party with a plan. A Shorten Labor government will take leadership on climate change. Labor's policy announcements yesterday were groundbreaking. They represent a comprehensive action plan that sets us on a path to meeting our global targets, cooling our environment and resetting Australia on a sustainable pathway. We've recognised that we face an emergency and we have a plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will implement Australia's first national electric vehicle policy, which will tackle transport emissions by setting a national electric vehicle target and introduce vehicle emissions standards. We will reduce pollution over the decades by extending the pollution safeguard mechanism with real incentives for big polluters to reduce emissions. We will ensure that the federal government can intervene to put in protections to stop broad-scale land clearing and will develop and deliver a national forestry summit and forestry strategic plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These policies are in addition to our already announced commitments such as investing in renewable energies and batteries. This will help reduce emissions and lower power bills. We'll double our original investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporationâthat's $10 billionâand we will establish a just transition authority to plan and coordinate the impact of closures of coal-fired power stations. This is a vital part of the whole plan. We must bring those vulnerable communities along with us or the division created by any action will allow a vacuum to be created that can too easily be filled by those opposite us, who rely on scaremongering and climate denialism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the only party who will deliver on real climate action. As a party of government, we will have the best chance to ensure that Australia no longer lags behind the rest of the world. Our plan will deliver decisive action to reduce our emissions, ensuring we play our part in the global fight against the climate emergency. We have committed not to allow the use of Kyoto credits to cheat Australia's way to meet the Paris targets. Instead, we will deliver strong policies that will ensure we do meet those targets genuinely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some say our targets are not high enough or good enough. But, last time we had that argument, we lost the opportunity to have a CPRS scheme, one that would have been in place for 10 years by now. Targets are there to be achieved and beaten. Nothing is stopping us going above and beyond. The key is to start urgently. My office is decorated with knitted corals that have been sent to me by people worried about the Great Barrier Reef. My walls are covered in postcards by children worried about the oceans. My bookshelves are full of climate research sent to me by researchers, and my inbox is full of emails from people worried about the future. I am glad to be a member of the Labor Party who will deliver for these people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I can understand the concern of many people around the challenges of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and concern around climate change. Having studied climate change and climate science, as a qualified carbon accountant, I've worked firsthand to deal with many of these challenges and what Australia can do. But I also look at it as an incredible opportunity to transition towards a sustainable future for Australia and jobs, to create the opportunities and to devise opportunities to innovate and to deliver for the Australian people, to deliver an environmental solution to so many of the challenges we faceâbecause we on this side can see that the future is going to be awesome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're doing is being part of the solution and leading the change. The member for Barker rightly made the point that what we need is modern Liberal vision for Australia in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and confronting climate change. What we need is modern Liberal leadership for Australia to make sure that we can turn plans into action. And that's what we're doing. We are delivering our Paris targets. The best indicator of future success is what you've done in the past. We have managed to meet our Kyoto targets by 128 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases, and we'll double it by 2020. And, of course, we are on track to meet our Paris targets as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Solutions Fund will continue on the early success of the ERF, and we're providing an additional $2 billion to cut two-thirds of the nation's emissions in the non-energy sector to deal with things like agriculture, land use, management and transport energy. Emissions reduction through this method is more than half the cost achieved through Labor's failed carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have Snowy 2.0, through which we're building the baseload renewable energy infrastructure Australia needs. The Snowy hydro power station was a critical project for the development of reliable renewable energy to secure Australia's energy grid in the past, and we are reinvesting in it today for its strategic importance as the battery of the nation, located between Melbourne and Sydney, to increase its contribution to Australia's energy baseload, particularly for households and industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have Marinus Link and are stopping energy waste by having Tasmania's hydro power, which is a critical part of the energy grid, deliver baseload renewables to the mainland. A second interconnector from Tasmania to the mainland will supply cheaper, reliable baseload power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the national electric vehicle strategy. Transport use is changing, and Australia needs a unique solution for our unique situation. Australians have always relied on cars as part of transport solutions because of the country's low density and distances. We are developing a strategy to reduce emissions from cars and freight to drive the adoption of new technology and deliver a comprehensive solution to meet Australia's needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the National Energy Productivity Plan. We need workable solutions to cut around 90 per cent of energy consumed by industry. Of course, that will deliver economic dividends and competitiveness as well. Our productivity plan is designed to reduce Australia's industry energy demands and cut consumption by 40 per cent by 2030 through practical measures such as efficient air conditioners and white goods and new environmental building standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which invests in renewable solutions: $10 billion is available to invest in renewable challenges, including new energy investment, increasing energy efficiency, reducing energy demand and the repurposing of energy resulting from waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Australia can lead the world in sectors where we are competitive. The $2 billion available through ARENA provides finance for innovation in sectors where Australia can grow industries that can compete with the world, ranging from biofuels through marine energy generation and solar to energy storage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have is a target, a plan and a road map to get there. What we will deliver is a plan, a target and a road map to get there. Compare that to the plan that our opponents have. They say 'plan', but it is an aspirational target with no way of getting there. It is like saying, 'I want to find my way to Darwin,' and then spending the next three months trying to pretend that somehow you have got a traffic map. You've got no idea how to get there and you've got no consequence. You just want to talk the talk; you are not interested in walking the walk. What this government does is walk the walk. It matches its plan against practical solutions which will take Australia forward and provide the modern Liberal leadership that this country so desperately needs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  Tasmanians are not afraid of clean, green renewable energy. It is part of our industrial heritage. It's part of our state identity, our history. We understand hydroelectric generation, our world-class wind resource and the advantages of small- and large-scale solar. Our world-leading Australian Maritime College, the AMC, leads research on wave and tidal energy research. In the national context, we have much work to do to repair the damage and division around energy created and/or perpetuated by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. That work can commence under a Shorten Labor government if elected. A Shorten Labor government will reduce pollution, invest in renewable energy and take real action on climate change to ensure that we hand a better deal to the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After six years of chaos, uncertainty and rising pollution under the Liberals, Australians need stability and certainty on climate change policy. That's what our plan delivers. Last week, I welcomed the member for Shortland and shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy to Launceston to announce the potential of a clean, green industrial process for the production of hydrogen in northern Tasmania, with an immediate commitment to a feasibility study of $250,000 towards hydrogen production in Northern Tasmania. The study will identify the best opportunities for northern Tasmania to be part of a supply chain in the globally massive industry, a $232 billion global juggernaut. Labor have committed $1.1 billion of funding to our national hydrogen strategy to develop a hydrogen industry in this country. Tasmania is well placed to tap into that industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have three distinct advantages in Tasmania: boundless renewable energy with some of the world's best wind resources, access to water and power through our hydro system and a deepwater port to transport that hydrogen product to Japan and South Korea. This opportunity could produce thousands of jobs for Northern Tasmania within my electorate. We already know that Tasmania has been and should be a centre of excellence when it comes to advanced manufacturing. Hydrogen would be another great manufacturing industry in Northern Tasmania where Tasmania would help to decarbonise the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The development of the hydrogen industry in Australia is one part of Labor's plan for ensuring Tasmania capitalises on the benefits of Australia's transition to renewable energy. Labor's plan will tackle climate change to keep the economy growing by investing in renewable energy, boosting clean transport and infrastructure, working in partnership with business and supporting trade exposed industries to keep Australian businesses competitive, helping the land sector to cut pollution whilst giving farmers and the forestry industry new opportunities to earn income, and developing Australia's first national strategy on climate change and health to address the growing health impacts and risks of climate change. This is in stark contrast to those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has failed to deliver lower pollution, failed to lower power prices and failed to strengthen the economy through real action on climate change. Theirs is a party of climate sceptics who are absolutely hopelessly divided on climate change. The Liberals have helped push up power prices by having 13 different energy policies, undermining investment in renewable energy, supporting taxpayer money for new coal plants and backing power privatisation. In fact, just one day after Labor announced the most comprehensive climate change action plan taken to a federal election by a major party in this country's history, the Prime Minister confirmed that the Liberals are proposing to spend taxpayers' dollars on new coal-fired power stations. This is a disgraceful display. After almost six years in government, the Liberals are still making up energy policy on the run, reaching their 13th energy policy in six yearsâa dangerous, reckless energy policy; an energy policy that adopts coal, which will have the direct effect of undermining Project Marinus and the Battery of the Nation, something all Tasmanians and, indeed, all Australians should beware of. This government doesn't understand renewable energy. It doesn't understand the fact that renewable energy offers a clean future for Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I think I've heard it all now. The member for Bass, if I heard him correctly, said Tasmania will decarbonise the world. Message to the member for Bass: Australia produces roughly 1.2 per cent of global emissions. If we were to reduce that to zero, per se, China on a per annum basis increases its emissions by more than what amounts to Australia's 1.2 per cent. So, if you think you're going to decarbonise the world from Tasmania, you keep fighting on, Charlie; you keep fighting on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this is a global challenge, and that's why we have to play our part globally. What does 'our part globally' look like? It looks like meeting our international obligations. We met Kyoto 1, we're on target to meet Kyoto 2 and, as you have heard from the minister regularly, we will meet our Paris obligations in a canter. What those opposite are doing is participating in what can only be described as a gargantuan effort to virtue signal to the Left of the Australian constituency and say: 'Don't run off and vote for the Greens. We're your climate warriors. We will stand up.' But what they fail to say is what impact this will have. Remember that the Chief Scientist has said these actions will have no impactâthat is, if we reduced our emissions to zero, that alone would have no impact globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does it mean to everyday, ordinary Australians? We've heard of a $9,000 hit on wages. We've heard it will cost 336,000 jobs. We'll see electricity up by 58 per cent. Those are things we knew before we came here this week, but we now know a lot more. We don't have the kind of detail we should have, but we know it will cost a lot more. It could cost as much as $35 billion to buy international credits. That's money leaving Australia, going to overseas countries and funding their schools, their hospitalsâthe kinds of services that, quite frankly, Australians deserve and need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My challenge is to the member for Port Adelaide. I want to know what he's got against the workers at the Kimberley-Clark mill in Millicent in my electorate. This is a facility that produces toilet paper and tissue paper. It directly employs about 350 people in that community; indirectly, it's about 450. Now, before those opposite rush off and say, 'Oh well, they're not environmentally responsible,' this is an organisation that's been recognised for its achievements in environmental sustainability. They've won several third-party sustainability awards over the past five years, and many of those awards directly resulted from the work they did at Millicent. This is my point: the reality here is that if you impose your policies on this business, there is a very high likelihood that this business will be incapable of continuing to operate. If that happens, guess what? We're still going to consume toilet paper, we're going to still need tissues, but they will come from overseas. They'll come from jurisdictions that don't have the kind of environmental regulation that we have in Australia, so, in effect, in your ill-advised attempt to reduce carbon emissions you will send this industrial effort overseas. In return, we will obviously lose those jobs, both direct and indirect, and we will import that toilet paper and tissue paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving aside the carbon miles on a container load, if not a shipload, if not many shiploads, of toilet paper, this will be produced in countries that don't have the kinds of regulations we do. And so effectively what you'll be doing is exporting jobs and increasing emissions. That's the real impact that this policy will have, because not only will you do thatâincrease carbon emissions from the transport of goods to Australia, export those jobs and force this industrial effort into jurisdictions that are less environmentally sensitiveâbut you'll also impoverish Australia as a nation. Andâlight-bulb momentâonly wealthy jurisdictions, only wealthy countries, can do stuff about their environment. Only wealthy jurisdictions can work to improve the environmental settings in their country. If you want to impoverish Australia, if you want to impoverish our fiscal position, then you will make it much more difficult for Australiansâand Australia as a nationâto care about and take a really strong interest in their environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I recently met with students who weren't taking time off school; they were taking time out of their weekend, on a Friday afternoon, to talk to me about why they care about climate change. These students from Colo High School, Katoomba High School and Bede Polding College put those opposite to shame. They knew more about climate change than anyone I have heard from on the opposite benches. And it was fact; it was science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They know that Australia is the highest emitter per capita in the industrialised world. That's a fact. They know that carbon pollution levels in Australia are rising. They know that the government's own data shows they've been rising since Prime Minister Tony Abbott and that Australia's on track to miss its own inadequate 2030 emissions reduction target of 26 per cent by a whopping 19 per cent. They know that 2018 was one of the five hottest years on record around the world, followed by 2007, 2016, 2015, 2014. It was the spring of 2013 that caused havoc in the Blue Mountains, in my electorate of Macquarie, with fierce and unprecedented bushfires. It's been a record in Australia this last year too, with 209 weather records beaten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These students know that the $2.25 billion spent by the government, by those on the opposite bench, have led to pollution going up, not down. They know that their own community of the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains faces not just fire but also floods that will be exacerbated by the changing climatic conditions. They know that natural disasters already cost the economy $18 billion a year. They can't vote yet, but they know something the government hasn't woken up to: climate change is real; it's a crisis and it requires urgent action. And RFS firefighters know it too. Farmers in Macquarie know it, grandparents in Macquarie know it, the insurance industry knows it and business knows it. Only Labor will deliver the urgent action that we know we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lower power prices are also a stress that families in my electorate face. They are stressing family budgets and creating anxiety for low-income people, and yet 13 energy policies and six years later all we're seeing from this government are power prices going up, up, up. Labor will change that. We can do both, and create jobs. In fact, 70,000 jobs in the renewables sector and 17,000 in the hydrogen sectorâthat's what our plan will do. Yesterday, the Labor Party announced what is the most comprehensive climate change action plan that's ever been taken to a federal election by a major party in this country's history. That's something we're very proud of. We've done the work, we've listened to business and we've listened to science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The target that Labor is taking to the federal election is the one we announced in 2015, for a 45 per cent emissions reduction cut by 2030 and net zero emissions by the middle of the century. It's not quite what my students would like to see, but it is a massive leap in the direction that we need to take. It's a position consistent with keeping global warming below two degrees. That's the commitment that another Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, signed Australia up to at the Paris climate conference in 2015. It is the absolute minimum commitment needed to discharge our responsibility to the kids from Colo high, Katoomba high, Bede Polding and every other school in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also committed to that 50 per cent renewable energy in our electricity mix by 2030. Renewable energyâand this might shock those oppositeâis the cheapest form of new energy. It is also a fabulous job creator. We're committed to cheaper, cleaner power through renewable energy, and we'll do that with rebates for solar batteries for 100,000 householdsâ$2,000 rebates to help build up the market for that product. These are batteries which will make a massive difference to people who already have solar on their roofs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll double the original investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by $10 billion. That will support new technologies. We'll boost clean transport and infrastructure, which make up 20 per cent of Australia's emissions and are one of the fastest-growing sources of pollution. On our electric vehicle policy: we're the only OECD country currently not to have a policy. Those over there should be ashamed of that! Our policy will set a national electric vehicle target of 50 per cent for new car sales. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  There's no doubt: our country faces challenges. It always has and it always will. How governments respond to those challenges defines who they are and defines their values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know what Labor's values are by virtue of their tax policies. We know very well Labor's plans around franking credits, negative gearing tax, capital gains and family trusts. Labor's only solution with respect to the economy is taxâtax, tax, tax. It's the only policy Labor relies on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In comes our challenge with climate change, and you would think that after nearly six years the Labor Party would actually have done thorough costings on its policy, but it has not. It has not; the opposition leader continues to stumble because he cannot answer the most basic of questions about what their climate change policy would cost. They haven't got a clue! What we do know, from independent modelling, is that their climate change policy is in fact nothing more than yet another tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take Tradie Joe. In a few years time, Tradie Joe might be very fortunate not to be one of the 336,000 people who lose their jobs as a result of Labor's energy policy. Tradie Joe survives. He's not one of those 336,000 who lose their job. Tradie Joe, unfortunately, is paying 50 per cent more in his energy billsâhis electricity billsâbecause Labor's policies increased wholesale prices by 58 per cent and they were passed through. Tradie Joe also is incurring $9,000 less in his wages. He's paying $5,000 more for his ute. He has a pie for lunch. Even the pie is taxed because of Labor's energy policy. He has a can of Coke. The can of Coke is taxed because of Labor's energy policy. He wants to buy his wife a packet of Tim Tams butâguess what?âLabor has a Tim Tam tax! These are the policies that are already being laid out by the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tradie Joe is fictitious for one key reason. We need to ensure those opposite do not get hold of the treasury bench because we know that their policies, right across portfolios, represent a wrecking ball to this economy. If anybody is unsure about the impact and intent of the Labor Party with respect to energy, they should look at the state of Queensland, where they are in government. In the state of Queensland the Queensland Labor government controls about 80 per cent of energy, running a complete monopoly right across the supply chain outside of the south-east. If you look at your quarterly bill in Queensland you'll see how much you are being ripped off by the Queensland Labor government on an annual basis: $468. The Queensland Labor government are more than happy to ensure that reductions in wholesale prices, courtesy of the coalition federal government, are not passed on to consumers. They are more than happy to ensure that their inflated asset values are not written down so they can keep charging and ripping off customers. They are more than happy to do dodgy debt deals where the Labor government lend money to the Labor energy company, who in turn provide healthy dividends to the Labor government. That's the way they work. That's the way they operate. With anything to do with serious policy there's only one answer from the Labor Party: tax, tax, tax, tax, tax. Labor know nothing but tax, and that is why they hope to kill this economy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. If we don't get it right, our children will pay the price. We may already be paying the costs. Climate change and the environment are top-of-mind issues for the people in my electorate of Wentworth and also of great concern to Australians everywhere. This will be a climate change and environment election, and the time to act is now. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this morning I met with Cassy Faux and Lauren McGrow, who were victims of the recent Tasmanian bushfires. When you also consider that there were floods in Queensland, prolonged drought, storms and a million dead fish at Menindee on the Darling River, with a dramatic drop in temperature following a period of very hot weather, it seems fair to say that we are seeing a rise in the prevalence of extreme weather events. I have spoken a number of times in this House about the need for urgent climate change action. The cost of inaction will be significant. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An integral part of the climate argument is the impact on our environment. Today I would like to speak about the growing problem of ocean plastics. In the past fortnight we heard about a whale in the Philippines that starved to death, having ingested 40 kilograms of plastics. Forty kilograms is an enormous amount. This was a wake-up call to all of us that we need to take action to limit the amount of plastic that is dumped into rivers and oceans worldwide.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global population is living, working and vacationing along the coast. Coastal populations stand in the front row of the greatest plastic waste tide we have ever faced. According to Boomerang Alliance, globally 275 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated each year and in 2016 over nine million tonnes of plastic entered the world's oceans. Ocean currents have formed five gigantic, slow-moving whirlpools, where the plastic collects, called gyres. Most of the plastic debris sinks or remains in the gyres, but a significant percentage remains in oceans, where it is a threat to sea life, or washes onto our coastlines daily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I volunteered with Clean Up Australia this year. You could not miss the presence of plastic on our shoreline. CSIRO recently completed a survey that found that three-quarters of the rubbish along Australia's coast is plastic. Most of it comes from Australian sources, not the high seas. Debris is concentrated near our cities. CSIRO also commented that Australia is probably a net exporter of debris to some neighbouring marine regions and surrounding countries. That is not the sort of export reputation that we should have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians consume over three million tonnes of plastic products and packaging each year but recycle less than 10 per cent of the plastics we use in Australia. Litter comprises 60 per cent of all marine plastic pollution, including around 420 million plastic bottles, another 200 million of other pieces of plastic packaging, 180 million plastic bags, 10 million plastic products and over 11 billion synthetic cigarette butts. After sunlight photodegrades the plastic into small pieces, aquatic life and seabirds mistake these fragments for food and ingest them. It's estimated that globally over one million seabirds and over 100,000 mammals die every year as a result of plastic. These creatures die through ingestion, mistaking it as food, or from entanglement in plastic items. It's difficult to know the exact figures, but a 2012 report from the Worldwide Society for the Protection of Animals indicated that between 57,000 and 135,000 whales are entangled in plastic marine debris. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 200 species are directly affected by marine plastic pollution, with 96 per cent of all marine biodiversity being vulnerable to the ingestion of these microplastics. While all plastic debris is dangerous to the environment, the threats escalate as plastic fragments into increasingly small pieces and enters the marine food chain and, in turn, our diet. These tiny microplastic particles are often mistaken as food, and, as latest research suggests, they are being ingested at very high levels. The CSIRO, for example, has found that 90 per cent of seabirds around the world have ingested plastic, and even planktonâthe basic element of the marine food chainâhas been observed ingesting microplastic. The prevalence of microplastic being ingested by our sea life is a major concern which has rapidly become one of the major threats to marine biodiversity. Humans are not immune from these effects. It is estimated that people who consume average amounts of seafood are ingesting approximately 11,000 particles of plastics each year.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Barrier Reef outlook report 2014</span> identified marine debris and plastics as major threats to the health of the reef. It was found that 683,000 items of marine debris were recovered within the marine park between 2008 and 2014. It's well known that plastics entering the world's oceans are having a huge impact on our marine life. But they also have far-reaching impacts on human health and on our economy. A UNEP 2014 report identifies that plastics finding their way into the world's oceans cost approximately $17.3 billion per year in environmental damage to marine ecosystems, and the total natural capital cost of plastics used in the consumer goods industry estimates at more than $99 billion per year. When the life span of products and packaging is taken into account, the annualised overall natural capital cost to the consumer goods sector is $35 billion, with the largest contributors being food, nondurable household goods, soft drinks and retail. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, estimates that the cost to the tourism, fishing and shipping industries was $1.6 billion in our region alone. Local authorities have to bear the cost of cleaning up plastic litter from beaches, maintaining litter traps and bins and managing landfill. Managing waste is an enormous cost burden on local councils, who have diminishing options for recycling and eliminating plastic waste. The European Union is taking the initiative. Single-use plastic items such as straws, forks and knives, as well as cotton buds, will be banned in the European Union by 2021. In Germany, a new packaging law will come into effect on 1 January, which aims to improve recycling and reduce packaging waste.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we fail to clean up the plastic and don't stop the continued pollution of the oceans, we are facing the potential extinction of many sea life species and the interruption of the entire marine ecosystem, as well as a depletion of our precious food stocks. The establishment of a national environment protection agency would be a positive start. It is time to act now. I will be speaking about this subject at the upcoming Bondi Ocean Lovers Festival in April, and I encourage anyone who cares about our marine environment to attend. I urge the Australian government to take decisive action by developing policy and dedicating funding to combat this environmental threat.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  As we head towards an election, it is worth remembering that we have seen six years of attacks from this government on Centrelink, on our social payment system and on people who are doing it the toughest. For six years, the government has punished people through Centrelink instead of supporting them. We've seen the disastrous robo-debt recovery program, the expansion of the cashless welfare card, outsourcing of staff to private companies like Serco, demerit points, Work for the Dole and, of course, the Community Development Program. And the rates of Newstart, youth allowance and other payments remain outrageously low. They lock people into poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a country like Australia, we should have a fair and accessible system that provides people with a safety net when they need it. There's sometimes talk from those on the right that poverty is a choice. Poverty's not a choice; no-one would ever choose it. But I'll tell you what is a choice: punishing people and keeping people in poverty. That is a choice that this government repeatedly makes and needs to be held accountable for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we debate the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2018-2019 and await tonight's budget, I want to share with the House the stories of people in my electorate who, as a result of this government's decision to raise money not by going after the top end of town but instead by attacking those who are least in a position to be able to afford it, have faced the consequences of this government's failure. We've been contacted by almost 350 Melbourne constituents who've needed help with Centrelink recently. When my office receives calls from university educated constituentsâlet alone people whose first language isn't Englishâwho want to raise their concerns because they can't understand or navigate the system, the situation is clear: Centrelink is breaking under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Melbourne constituent Bridget contacted my office after her claim for youth allowance, which she had made four months earlier, still hadn't been processed. She made the claim well before her university semester and was still waiting after the semester had finished. Bridget's a full-time student, but she was forced to work up to four days a week to cover her basic costs. She told my office that this had a huge impact on her studies and her health. She was forced to work when she wanted to focus on her studies. After my office contacted Centrelink, her claim progressed, but she was told by them that she was no longer eligible for youth allowance because she was earning too much. You don't process their claims, you force them to go to work and then you say, 'We're not going to give you any of your payments because you are earning too much.' My constituent was forced to work because her claim took more than four months to be processed, only to be told that the situation the government forced her into then excluded her from receiving the support that she needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One constituent contacted my office after making a claim for Austudy that still hadn't been finalised more than three months later. She went without any income support from the government for more than three months, struggling to pay bills and rent, and couldn't work because her degree required her to do two 14-week full-time placements. So she wasn't in a position to be able to go and work. Another Melbourne constituent contacted my office after her disability support pension was cancelled in July last year without notice. She wasn't able to go to a service centre due to her disability and didn't have a phone. She spent 45 minutes standing in the freezing cold at a phone booth waiting on hold to speak to Centrelink, who then gave her the wrong information and didn't reinstate her payment. She was told her payment was cancelled because Centrelink wanted to transition her to the age pension, when, in fact, it was cancelled because Centrelink had sent a letter to the wrong address. She told my office she'd been living off bread and tea for two months and that she'd just run out of tea. She had been sent threatening letters to vacate her residence because she was so behind on rent and she was at risk of having all her belongings sold because she couldn't continue paying for storage. This should not be happening in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent, Alex, contacted my office after his claim for the disability support pension was refused. His appeal had been going on for more than one year. In the meantime, his disability meant that he couldn't get work, and the government's payment for Newstart allowance is so low that, after he pays his monthly rent of $1,250, he has less than $200 per month to pay for his bills and food. That's more than 90 per cent of his income that goes on rent, but he doesn't have any options because he can't access affordable housing. Alex told my office that he uses the torchlight on his phone instead of turning on the lights in his house, because that is what this government is putting him through. He tells my office that he is only one step away from being homeless. With the government's new demerit points system, all it would take is one system error to see him miss a rental payment and be out on the street.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the stories from the people who live in Melbourne. Right around Melbourne and right around the whole country, people are getting screwed by this government. The truth is that people accessing Centrelink will never match the big donations to the big parties of the big banks and developers and coal companies, so they're seen as easy targets for budget cuts and punitive attacks. It is shameful that governments are failing people like this. We need to make governments serve the many, not just the powerful few donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst sharing these stories, I also want to acknowledge here in parliament the work being done by the Australian Unemployed Workers' Union, who are taking a stand for the right to social support and secure payments when we need them. Social support and secure payments when we need them are, of course, and should be, the right of all people in this country. They are informing Centrelink recipients about their rights and organising to change the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government might think that the system is working fine when we punish people rather than help them, but it is not. That is a broken system. The Greens will continue to fight for people's rights to gain proper support and to increase the single rate of Newstart and youth allowance by $75 a weekânot put it under review but to increase it. We don't need more reviews. We knowâthe facts are inâthat people are living so far below the poverty line that it is a barrier to their finding work and to their staying healthy and well. We must lift Newstart and youth allowance by $75 a week. Newstart hasn't increased in real term in decades. It is locking people into poverty. We need to change that and we will keep fighting until we do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS needs to be there for people who need it. The NDIS is the beginning of work that needs to be done so that people with disabilities can live a good life. But the NDIS needs to be properly resourced and its flaws need to be addressed so that it can provide people with the support they need. I want to share some of the stories of people who live in Melbourne who face difficulties accessing disability support through the NDIS. My office is receiving an increasing number of inquiries about the NDIS as it continues to roll out across Melbourne. We've heard from many constituents facing extremely long delays in accessing NDIS and from even more people who have been waiting months and months for a review of their plan to be completed. Melbourne constituent Lorraine contacted me when her NDIS package had been cut from over $40,000 for the year to just $9,000, placing her at serious risk of having to go into care without access to adequate supports. Lorraine requested an urgent review of her package and some five months later, and only after intervention from my office, Lorraine's review was finalised. Lorraine told my office that once her review was completed, with the same information the NDIS had the entire time, her package was increased from $9,000 for the year to up to $46,000 for just the six months remaining of her plan. She told my office that this process aged her significantly and caused her tremendous undue stress for almost half a year. We're happy to help Lorraine, but you shouldn't have to go to your MP to get your NDIS plan increased from $9,000 to $46,000 on the basis of information that the authority had for the whole time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard from parents of young children with autism who waited six months or more for their children's NDIS plans to be finalised, missing out on integral early childhood support. Six months is a long time in a child's life. If you have to wait that long you can miss out on integral early childhood support and that can push families to the breaking point. People can't see their draft plans before they're signed off, giving no opportunity for participants to argue for a better plan. Given this, together with a cap on staffing of 3,700 people, well under the Productivity Commission's recommended 10,000 staff, it is no wonder that people in Melbourne have to wait six months or more without access to vital support while their plans are inevitably reviewed. The NDIS needs as many staff as it needs to deliver that service. It is so important that the NDIS works for everyone. We'll keep working to make sure it's properly resourced. I want to acknowledge the important advocacy of my Greens colleagues Senator Jordon Steele-John and Senator Rachel Siewert, who have worked so hard for this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just had news this week of the success of the campaign for a royal commission into violence towards and abuse, exploitation and neglect of people with a disability. Congratulations to everyone who worked for this. Change can happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Melbourne is a great place to live, but the things that make it liveable are under pressure, and that includes the cost of renting. Yesterday, a report from NATSEM showed that more than one in five renters in Melbourne were under significant rental stress, the highest rate for any electorate in the country. If you want an illustration as to why this is the case you need look no further than the real estate pages online during the course of last week. A rental listing was posted for a tiny apartment in Richmond in my electorate. Not only was it tinyâa one-bedroom apartmentâbut on the plan the kitchen was in the garage. To get into the house you had to walk through a hallway and through two adjoining doors, one either side of that hallway, and in that hallway was the bathroom. You had to walk through the bathroom in order to get to the other rooms. A kitchen in the garage, a bathroom in your hallway: how much was being asked for for that? $450 per week. It is unacceptable that in 2019 people are being forced to cook in a car parking space and pay $450 a week. Everyone who rents has a horror story about inspecting dodgy places like this, yet prices are sky-high and out of reach for too many. This week, one man came into my office after applying for 50 rental properties and being refused for each one. That is what is happening. People are applying for 50 rental properties and being refused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last decade, rents in Melbourne have risen by, on average, about 4.9 per centâover twice the rate of wage growth. According to last year's Anglicare rental survey, not one property in all of Melbourne is affordable for a single person on youth allowance or Newstart. If you're on the minimum wage, only 38 out of the 11,536 homes up for rent across the whole of metropolitan Melbourne are affordable. That is not just in my electorate but across the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. Out of over 11,000 places up for rent, only 38 are affordable if you are on the minimum wage. Even as the decades-long explosion in housing sales prices is coming to an end, reports indicate that rental prices are not falling and that renters are still facing the pressure. The rules are rigged. Government give tax breaks to investors to buy their fourth, fifth or sixth home, while renters are left paying for it. Young people are saddled with debt and living in the precarious world of short-term contracts and the gig economy. They are being sold out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will announce its budget and all its election plans, and you can bet your bottom dollar that it will do nothing to fix the rental crisis, just like it will do nothing to fix education or tackle the climate crisis or do anything to stand up to Senator Pauline Hanson and the right-wingers inside the government. It is absolutely time that we turf this mob out, but we need to have the guts to stand up and say, 'We need rent control in this country, like they have in other countries.' It is time for rent control and to cap rents. We tried to get action on this in Victoria, but the Victorian Labor government has said no. The Greens will keep fighting for rent control to tackle this crazy, out-of-control situation. Hopefully we can get the next government to change its mind, because young people are being sold out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a reason 50,000 students in Melbourne took to the streets to march to demand climate action. There's a reason. People are seeing this government and other governments around the world selling out their future. It comes in the form of the climate crisis, in the form of high household debt, in the form of graduating from university with a huge debt hanging around your neck and in the form of high rent. The Greens will stand up for young people and demand a better deal. The start of that is turfing this current mob out, and the next step is holding the next lot to account.</span>

It has underpinned chaos and political power plays for too long. For too long, words by both major parties have been just that: empty words, words they have used to pretend they care about climate action and policy, words which suddenly come to the fore with a pending election, words which find their way onto surveys, flyers and town hall robocalls, which are made at the taxpayer's expense.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the seat of Flinders, there is a proposed project by AGL. The project is this: a floating gas import facility on Western Port Bay at Crib Point, a beautiful part of the world. Concerned locals formed the Save Westernport group. They have worked tirelessly, including consulting both the major parties, to stop this project to build a floating gas import terminal on Western Port Bay. This floating terminal will be capable of importing liquefied natural gas from ships in Western Port Bay. Every time a shipment is delivered, the process would mean taking in sea water from the bay. The water, equivalent to 180 Olympic swimming pools a day, would be chlorinated, chilled and discharged back into the sea seven degrees cooler.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An extension of this project is a 55-kilometre pipeline proposed from Crib Point Jetty. This pipeline would cut through internationally significant wetlands, private properties and Melbourne's food bowl. The Labor Party are supporting this and whilst their local candidate in the seat of Flinders sought permission from his party to say he doesn't like it, and he said this on a Facebook post, this is just that: words on a social media post that will probably find their way onto a few flyers. No way can he fight the major-party machine. He's just saying he doesn't like it. Nice try. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse than that is the local member for Flinders, also known as the Minister for Healthâalso, remarkably and staggeringly, previously known as the Minister for the Environment. He has suddenly also done some Facebook posts and handed out flyers saying he's done robocallsâand he's blaming Labor. 'Stop AGL's project,' he says. There have been town hall telephone calls and he's issued incredible numbers of documents, again, at taxpayers' expense. On the side, he has said quietly to the Save Westernport groupâthat care passionately about this issueâthat there's no way the Save Westernport group are going to succeed here. Countless locals have said to me: 'We just don't believe anything the member for Flinders says any more. It doesn't matter if it's in a brochure or on a robocall.' Having worked with the Save Westernport group, I am so proud to support decisive action in the form of a formal petition that requests the federal government of the day to stop this development and to protect the Western Port site. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government of the day's specific role in wetland management and protection is established under the international Ramsar convention. The proposed AGL floating gas terminal in Crib Point is subject to federal government assessment and approval, which the state Labor Party have given support to, and processes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The government of the day has the avenue to review this project and stop it under our international obligations of the Ramsar convention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This formal petition was brought to Canberra this week and we will continue to accumulate signatures. This is effective, constructive action. The train has left the station, in many ways, because of the support of the Labor Party and the implicit support of the member for Flinders, and the government, by turning a blind eye. They ignored their obligations under the Ramsar convention in relation to Toondah Harbour in Queensland. This is an avenue. This Ramsar convention says we can take this real action to protect our environment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Independent I believe in the power of the people, the local people, and this Save Westernport group have done an amazing job. They have done an amazing job. They don't want to see this floating gas facility destroy this beautiful part of the world where the sea is, where people swim, where people walk their dogs and where the flora and fauna of Australia are at their best. It would be a brutal blow to put a pipeline through marine wetlands of our beautiful country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in the seat of Flinders tell me they've been taken for granted for too long and their concerns about local issues are being ignored. They are tired of the combative politics and game playing purely for self-promotion and getting votes for the major parties. They want change. They want a representative with experience and commitment who genuinely wants to get things done for their local community. This AGL project has the potential to cause serious air, light, noise and water pollution, present fire hazards, negatively impact on property values and risk marine life and aquaculture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one I have spoken to in the local community across Flinders, particularly about this project, believes their local member anymore. Why should they? The member for Flinders, when he was the Minister for the Environment, is the man who approved Adani. The member for Flinders is the man who was a prime mover in ousting former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and deputy leader Julie Bishop. He's the man who felt that with the member for Dickson they would make a great duo of leadership. In fact, his role in destroying our environment, in not protecting our environment, as the minister for our environment has been incredible. He is the man who lied to the leaders of our country, who lied to his local community, and he's living a lie in relation to this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Flinders feel their voice has not been heard and they are sceptical about the meetings which have gone nowhere and the sudden flurry of costly, meaningless pre-election flyers and forms designed purely to data-harvest and obtain contact details. That is not a real petition. That is to do data harvesting and write and send more flyers to people. The government of the day cannot shirk this responsibility, nor can it deny that it has the power to put a stop to the AGL development which the petition calls for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government's specific role in wetland management and protection is established under the Ramsar convention, and the proposed facility is subject to this assessment process. The petition gives the local community a voice in Canberra, a powerful voice to tell the government that they want effective action to stop this development.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an independent I believe in the power of the people. Climate change action must happen. Climate change is not only real; it is happening. We've seen it in Flinders. We've seen it across our country. A strong independent will bring back the balance, stop the lies and stop the empty words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of stop, we have to stop Adani. Australia does not have a social licence to go ahead with Adani, but both the major parties will pay lip service to that and say in one state they can't and in another state, yes, they will, depending on where the votes are. We have to support our children, the strike-for-climate leaders. They did an amazing job. These are the future generation. These are the people who we have to make sure we engage in climate change action now so we do not leave intergenerational debt in relation to our beautiful country and in relation to our climate and our planet. We need genuine actionâno more words. I am so proud to support the local community and the broader Australian community on this critical issue of climate change action. The major parties have got to stop using it for sound bites in the press and to create their flyers come election time. We have to do real and serious action. We have to listen to the people. We have to listen to the stop Adani people. We have to listen to the strike-for-climate leaders. We have to listen to the students, to the younger generation. We have to listen to the save Western Port group. We have to save Western Port Bay. We have to stop AGL and companies such as this that are doing nothing more than wrecking our environment and absolutely fruitlessly destroying our environment for the sake of profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Save Western Port group, I thank you and I stand with you in relation to this issue. I say the same to any person in this country who is saying that they want to protect our climate for future generations and to meet our international obligations: renewables are the future and we need business certainty in relation to reducing our emissions. We cannot invest in new coal-fired power stations and we must take climate change action now and critically. Thank you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  With an election due shortly after the budget, the coalition has proposed the passage of supply bills to ensure there's an appropriation authority for the operations of departments to administer a range of programs across the Commonwealth. These bills, the Supply Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 2019-2020 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, provide appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of the government for a portion of 2019-20. The bills don't reflect any measures from the 2019-20 budget but reflect measures from the 2018-19 MYEFO which are currently before the House as part of the additional estimates bills. Of course, Labor does not block supply, unlike the coalition, and we will not do so in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals will say or do anything over the next six weeks to cover up for the dysfunction, the chaos and the cuts to many government services and programs that have been characteristic of this out-of-control government. This isn't a budget about Australia's best interests; this is an election document from a desperate Prime Minister looking after his own interests, not the interests of the Australian people. Australians have every right to ask: if these announcements are so important now, why have they waited until six weeks before an election? What about the last six years? The latest Prime Minister in the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government will boast about how strong the budget is and how corporate profits are at record highs. Those opposite will say things have never been better, but they just don't get it. They do not understand just how much Australian families, Australian pensioners and Australian small businesses are struggling at the moment. They don't get that everything is going up except people's wages. The cost of living is going up, power bills and health insurance bills are skyrocketing, and families are suffering from the Liberals' cuts to schools and hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last three budgets the Prime Minister, as the Treasurer, cut funding for schools and Medicare while locking in an additional $80 billion tax handout to the top end of town. That's what the Liberals will always be aboutâcutting hospitals and schools and looking after the top end of town. Australians will judge this Prime Minister not on whatever he's promising today but on the damage that he has already done to our nation. And it's a track record that's full of lowlights: cuts to schools and hospitals while looking after the top end of town with $80 billion worth of tax cuts; cuts of $715 million to Medicare and public hospitals; cuts of $5 billion to TAFE, apprenticeships and university funding; voting seven times to cut public school funding; voting 26 times to block a banking royal commissionâand we've all seen from the evidence that's come out of the banking royal commission what a disaster this government has been when it comes to taking stronger action to ensure that Australians aren't ripped off through our financial services and banking sectorâand voting six times to cut penalty rates. This means that middle-class and working Australians are paying more and missing out on a fair go. It's a bleak legacy that shows that the Liberals and Nationals are only for the top end of town. Of course, the Prime Minister cut more than $4 billion out of the pockets of many Australian pensioners. In this day and age, we need to be protecting Australian age pensioners, not giving more handouts to big banks and multinationals and cutting some people off the pension. Cutting those taper rates has seen almost 200,000 people go off the pension at the same time that those opposite are giving tax cuts to multinationals and big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all their talk about being better economic and fiscal managers, debt has hit record high levels and is growing under this Liberal government. Net debt has more than doubled on their watch and is now more than $370 billion. On their watch, gross debt has crashed through the half-a-trillion-dollar mark for the first time ever in Australia's history and has reached a record $534.2 billion. Both kinds of debt are growing faster under the Liberals, with their rosy global economic conditions, than under Labor, when we had to deal with the downside associated with the global financial crisis. The Prime Minister and this Liberal government, both modern and ancient, have no-one else to blame but themselves for their record and their growing debt. The budget is a mess and debt is at record highs because of the Liberals' twisted priorities, including giving unsustainable tax breaks to those who need them the least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government aren't about managing the economy or the budget in the interests of ordinary Australians. Under the Liberals, the economy is not working for all Australians. It's why Australians are feeling the pinch and are not feeling positive about their future, are not feeling positive about the housing market, are not feeling positive about their employment prospects and are not feeling positive about business investment and small-business growth in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong economy needs, most importantly, a stable government with investment certainty, and that is the complete opposite of what the government have delivered over the course of the last six years, with not only three prime ministers but the fact that they haven't had an energy policy during the whole six years. They've had 11 different iterations of energy policies. Whilst they bicker within their party room about whether or not climate change is real, Australia's energy prices have been going through the roof, and it's small businesses, pensioners and families that are struggling to make ends meet that are paying the cost of the government's chaos and dysfunction and division around energy policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you could go across a number of areas where there are similarities, where the division and the chaos of this government have stopped real progress in ensuring that the economy grows in the interests of the average Australian. Another area is the NBN, which of course, under this governmentâparticularly given that it was the former Prime Minister's pet issue as the former communications ministerâis a disaster. Signing up to the NBN and a month later having no internet services at all has been characteristic for many people who've signed up to it under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong economy needs a stable government, and the Liberals are so divided and dysfunctional that they can't even manage themselves. They've been too busy fighting amongst themselves or looking into One Nation for ideas on how to manage the economy. Six years of Liberals' cuts and chaos have damaged the economy. Under the Liberals, wages growth is at its slowest on record, which means that many households and their budgets are struggling. Childcare costs are up 24 per cent, power bills up 15 per cent and private health costs up 30 per cent. Company profits are growing six times faster than wages and have been doing so since 2016. One point eight million Australians are underemployed, meaning they can't find enough hours to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Living standards are stagnating, and household debt is at record highs. Australia has one of the highest levels of household debt, associated predominantly with very high housing costs, and yet this government refuses to do anything about that. It even countenances some of the most generous tax concessions that exist in the world for property investors, which ensure that the average first-home buyer is priced out of the market because they don't get the government support that the average property investor gets under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' only plan has been cutsâcuts to education, cuts to health, cuts to Medicare, cuts to schools and massive tax cuts for the big banks and for big business. It means that many Australians are hurting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Labor has a different approach. We have a different plan. Compare this bleak legacy with Labor's plan to give all Australians a fair go, not just the banks and not just the big end of town. We'll pay for our plan by making multinationals pay their fair share of tax here in Australia, stopping them shifting profits overseas before they pay tax here in Australia, closing tax loopholes that mainly benefit the top end of town in Australia and give tax breaks to big multinational companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Fair Go Action Plan will fix our schools and hospitals. We'll ease the pressure on household budgets. We'll stand up for workers by ensuring that we're restoring penalty rates for low-paid workers who have to work on weekends. We'll invest in cheaper, cleaner, renewable energy to reduce power prices, and we'll build a strong economy that works for all. That is Labor's commitment to the Australian people: to ease the pressure, to listen to your concerns and to make sure that the economy works in your interests, not in the interests of the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Fair Go Action Plan fixes our schools and hospitals, delivers bigger tax cuts for workers and puts money back into the pockets of everyday Australians. That's good for the whole economyânot just for the few who are wealthy and are well off, but for the whole economy and all Australians, particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet with their household budgets. Labor's led the way when it comes to budget repair that is fair, and we'll continue to display the fiscal and economic leadership this government has proven incapable of.</span>

As the member noted, these are supply bills. They seek authority from the parliament for the expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the 2019-20 financial year. The total of the appropriations sought through these supply bills is just under $45.7 billion. I remind all members that the bills must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all entities from 1 July 2019, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The appropriations proposed in the bills are based on five-twelfths of the estimated 2019-20 annual appropriations as presented at the 2018-19 budget, adjusted for economic and program specific parameters and the effect of decisions announced as part of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook or included in the 2018-19 additional estimates appropriation bills. Therefore, this funding will last through until the end of November.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to emphasise again that these bills seek provision only to appropriate money to fund the government expenditure on an interim basis until appropriation bills are passed. The arrangement allows for the budget appropriation bills or similar bills to be passed in 2019-20 by the next parliament if necessary. I thank all members and I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Amendment Bill 2019 makes amendments to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018, commonly referred to as the FITS Act. The FITS Act created a registration scheme for persons undertaking certain activities on behalf of foreign government related entities, foreign political organisations and foreign government related individuals. This bill makes a number of changes to the existing law to close what are, in effect, loopholes in the existing Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the bill amends the definition of 'communications activity' in section 13 of the FITS Act to include people and companies who produce material on behalf of a foreign principal for the purpose of that information being communicated or distributed to the public. This addresses a gap in the current scheme. Under the existing definition, a foreign principal could pay an advertising agency to produce content and those ads could potentially run on national television without triggering registration or disclosure obligations under the FITS Act. The amendment to the definition of 'communications activity' addresses that gap. In the example I just gave, the advertising agency would be subject to registration and disclosure obligations under the FITS Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the bill would make a minor drafting clarification to section 14 of the FITS Act. Currently, section 14 provides that the purpose of the activity must be determined having regard to, among other things, 'the intention or belief of the person undertaking the activity'. The amendment would make it clear that the relevant belief is the person's belief about the intention of any foreign principal on whose behalf an activity is undertaken. This will ensure that, even if a foreign principal does not explicitly state that a particular activity is intended to influence a political decision, it will be relevant if the person undertaking the activity believes that to be the foreign principal's intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the bill amends sections 35, 37 and 38 of the FITS Act to address a number of gaps in the reporting obligations under the act. Currently, disclosure obligations only apply where a person is already registered under the scheme. These amendments will, among other things, align the act's registration and reporting time frames to capture people who are liable to register but who have not yet registered and ensure that the obligation to make disclosures in respect of relevant activities extends to all people who undertake such activities on behalf of a foreign principal and not just to people who are already registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill would amend the offence provision in section 57 of the FITS Act to align it with normal Commonwealth drafting practices for criminal offence provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting the changes in this bill to address the various drafting problems with the FITS Act that have come to light, despite the fact that the government worked on that piece of legislation for well over a year. This bill highlights, once again, the need to ensure all legislationâbut especially national security legislationâis the subject of proper consultation, considered drafting and thorough preparation before it is brought to the parliament. It makes the job of all of us in this place easier and it makes our laws better. If we had spent less time during the 45th Parliament fixing the government's avoidable mistakes, we could have spent more time working on the solutions to the very real problems that continue to exist in the Australian community. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

They expect to know, or to be able to easily find out, when a foreign government or other foreign actor is undertaking activities which are intended to influence our political systems or processes. The commencement of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme on 10 December last year was a major step forward in ensuring this is the case. For the very first time in Australia, the public and decision-makers in government have a mechanism for being made aware of the forms and sources of foreign influence in our democratic processes and institutions.</span>

The amendments will clarify the operation of a number of key provisions and improve the workability of the scheme. These amendments will give better effect to the important transparency intention of the act and continue to enhance the Australian public's knowledge of the level and extent to which foreign sources may influence the conduct of Australia's elections, government and parliamentary decision-making, and the creation and implementation of laws and policy. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I was born and raised in Townsville. I have been through Cyclone Althea, the flood of the late seventies and 'The Night of Noah' flood of 1998. But nothing in my life memory can compare with the disaster and the devastation of the flood that we experienced on 3 February 2019. Townsville experienced the worst flood in its recorded history. We had a year's rainfall in nine days, with 1,134 millimetres recorded up to 9 am on Monday, 4 February 2019, reaching over 1.65 metres. The Ross River Dam reached a record-breaking 244 per cent. More than 22,000 homes and 110 roads in Townsville were affected by this extreme weather event. Every day after the flood, my team and I visited families in affected areas, helping them clean up their homes. We delivered burritos and water donated by GYG and Morco Fresh Foods. We have been helping Townsville residents with their federal government disaster recovery claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the Treasury Laws Amendment (North Queensland Flood Recovery) Bill 2019 because it provides vital funding for our disaster-ridden community. But I will also take this time to condemn the LNP government for its difficult and shameful criteria associated with the special disaster assistance recovery funding. The claims process has created more stress for people who are already stressed. The LNP claims process is a hoop-jumping exercise that includes incredibly harsh restrictions on claims. Cherrie Vitalli, whose house was inundated by floodâshe lives in the red flood zoneâwas denied the vital relief funding three times. Elaine in Railway Estate was denied vital assistance because she lives in a Queenslander home, and the LNP made harsh restrictions where the water had to go over the floorboards of the main part of the home. Under her home, the bottom floor was not covered. The LNP government left the local Department of Human Services staff very vulnerable. They were not allowed to assist their fellow Townsville residents with their claims because residents could only call a Melbourne number between nine and five. Townsville had to fight through the flood and then had to fight the LNP government for its fair share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville residents shouldn't be treated as second-class citizens by this government, not to mention the fact that the LNP government is treating Townsville small businesses disgracefully. I fought the LNP government to include local small business in their disaster relief funds. Many local small businesses are struggling to get assistance from the LNP government to get back on their feet and, importantly, keep their staff employed. We dragged the LNP kicking and screaming to the table to provide relief for Townsville businesses and finally, more than a month after the flood, the government eventually came to the table. But, once again, the LNP government set strict and harsh criteria for small-business relief grants. These harsh restrictions have made it almost impossible for any small business to be granted the relief funding that they deserve and desperately need. Just as I have been visiting flood affected families, I have also visited flood affected Townsville small businesses and I can safely say small businesses are angry with this out-of-touch LNP government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited local business owner Warren Figg who owns Auto Centre Townsville. His business was inundated. He has a car yard. The car yard and the office were inundated. He was concerned about keeping his business going so that his employees would not lose their jobs and he could get on with selling his vehicles. As Warren said, this funding should be easy to access to reduce the stress on small-business owners. The reality is that these funds would flow straight back into a struggling community. Surely it is not too much to expect that the LNP government would assist small-business owners after this devastation. Warren, like so many others, needs this vital funding. Warren applied for the small business relief funding almost immediately and, after six weeks, he was still waiting for a response. The grant provides up to $50,000 for small businesses impacted by the flood, but, as Warren has described, he and other Townsville small businesses have had to jump through a lot of hoops just to apply for the grant. Warren advised that, after he applied for the grant and he had not heard anything for a couple of weeks, he made a phone call. He was told an assessor had not even picked up his application to look at it and they could not give him a time when this would happen. This is simply not good enough. The LNP's criteria and mountains of paperwork seem to be designed to keep small businesses excluded rather than included. Townsville businesses need to have a simple, clear, less bureaucratic process. Simply get rid of the red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time to help small businesses in Townsville. Now is the time for the government to take action to help these businesses get back on their feet. Warren has described the whole rigmarole that he has been put through by the LNP government as getting 'hung out to dry'. Warren has so far spent close to $50,000 to just get the business started again, but some businesses do not have this cashflow to get their businesses going. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and LNP members, let me tell you: you are not helping small businesses get back on their feet. You are putting the owners' livelihoods at stake and putting the one in every four jobs that is created by a small business in Townsville at risk. Townsville's jobs are directly under threat because of LNP's out-of-touch and harsh criteria for small-business relief grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 391 businesses have been affected directly by the floods in Townsville, with an average loss of $98,000. Combined state and federal funding totals $27.2 million for relief grants for small businesses. In Townsville, $724,112 has been delivered for 100 businesses. That is less than three per cent of the money delivered to our community. The LNP need to wake up. Small businesses in Townsville are hurting and hurting badly. The strict criteria are killing small businesses in Townsville and costing local jobs that we cannot afford to lose, given our unemployment rate is almost double that of the national average. Unemployment has already almost doubled, as I said, and it will continue to get worse if we do not get help to the small businesses that have been affected by this devastating flood. The LNP need to review their harsh and rigid restrictions. I demand action now on this issue. Townsville deserves our fair share and I will fight tooth and nail for my community to get our fair share.</span>

The Treasury Laws Amendment (North Queensland Flood Recovery) Bill 2019 includes three measures, all aimed at providing support to those affected by floods and storms in Queensland. Schedule 1 makes qualifying disaster payments, recovery and on-farm grants to Queensland flood-affected primary producers, small businesses and non-profit organisations non-assessable nonincome for tax purposes. Schedule 2 treats qualifying payments to primary producers in Fassifern Valley, Queensland, affected by storm damage in October 2018 as exempt income for tax purposes. Schedule 3 provides a special appropriation for the government to establish and administer a loans scheme that will enable banks to offer reduced-interest-rate loans to eligible primary producers affected by the floods. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how important it is that people with disability receive high-quality care from the people they trust. This is one of the key reasons why, when Labor were last in government, we introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is why Labor committed to a royal commission into violence against and abuse and neglect of people with disability back in May 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People with disability are significantly more vulnerable to abuse and neglect, and often they are simply unable to access the justice that they deserve. This bill establishes the legislative framework for the commencement of a national worker screening database for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, known as the NDIS. The Council of Australian Governments Disability Reform Council agreed to establish a nationally consistent approach to worker screening in which states and territories will collect and analyse worker screening applications for the NDIS and the Commonwealth will establish and maintain a national database.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, individual states and territories are responsible for collecting and maintaining their own worker screening processes. This bill maintains individual state and territory arrangements for the collection of worker screening information, but it creates, importantly, a central national database to store and disclose that information as required. The database will disclose information to those who are employing staff to work with NDIS participants to confirm to employers whether a particular person does or does not pose a risk to people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes this legislation because we know that people with disability are at greater risk of abuse than others in our community. Too often this abuse comes at the hands of people whom people with disability should be able to trust the most. There are many horrific cases of people with disability being abused and assaulted in institutions, and residential and educational settings. According to Disabled People's Organisations Australia, 92 per cent of women with intellectual disability have been sexually assaulted. Sixty per cent of these assaults occur before these women turn 18. Further, children with disability are at least three times more likely to experience abuse than other children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the national worker screening database will be an important tool to prevent some abuse occurring in the future, it can never investigate the crimes of the past, nor will it address systemic failings in other sectors, including health, education, mental health and justice. The voices of people who have been abused must be heard. We cannot continue to allow these sickening incidents of abuse to be swept under the carpet. This is why Labor committed to a royal commission into violence and abuse of people with a disability, which the Leader of the Opposition, along with the member for Jagajaga, announced in May 2017. Only a royal commission will have the power, weight and authority to uncover the stories of injustice and deliver lasting changes for people with disability. It is good to see the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government finally take the royal commission seriously. People with disability and Labor have been calling for this for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has called on the government to ensure that the final terms of reference are broad and cover a range of contexts, including education, health, mental health and residential settings. Labor believes it is crucial that it also covers historic abuse and abuses. Above all, it is imperative that the government consult with people with disability and their advocates, not only in setting the terms of reference but also in the conduct of the royal commission itself. Labor has also called for the majority of the members of the royal commission to have lived experience of disability and for at least one royal commissioner to be of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. Labor has also asked the government to consider assistant commissioners to make sure the voices of people with different experiences of disability, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and LGBTIQ people are considered at every stage of the process in the formulation of the recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take the opportunity to briefly discuss the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison's government neglect of the National Disability Insurance Scheme over the past five years. I have been absolutely gobsmacked and extraordinarily disturbed by the many people I have met with, both people with a disability and their families and advocates, to hear some of these stories. The government's last-minute announcement on prices for providers is an admission that it has completely botched the rollout of the scheme. The NDIS is recording a massive underspend. The scheme is running behind schedule, with the equivalent of 77,000 eligible participants missing out. Participants are continuing to experience lengthy delays and plans are being underutilised. This means that people with disability are simply not receiving the support that they need. The government should get the NDIS right, not use it to prop up its budget, and that is what we are seeing. Let there be no misguidance on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, the Liberals placed a staffing cap on the National Disability Insurance Agency which has stifled the agency's capacity to properly roll out the scheme and has placed unnecessary pressure on staff. Labor's plan, if we are afforded government, is clear. We will start by abolishing the Liberals' arbitrary staffing cap. This will give capacity for the NDIA to do its job properly. We have to make sure the NDIS fulfils its promise and improves the lives of Australians with disability and this means putting people with disability and their families back at the heart of the NDIS.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I second the amendment. I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for Barton and shadow minister for families and social services. This bill amends the NDIS Act to provide a legislative framework for requiring that the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission maintains a national worker screening database for the NDIS. Whilst we welcome the measure, it is critical that this bill notes the importance of the royal commission into violence against and abuse of those living with disability. Tonight I acknowledge my friend and colleague Liesl Tesch from the New South Wales parliament, who is also a wheelchair user. Liesl is a powerful advocate for people with disability in our community and across Australia. These are her words: 'The NDIS was designed to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, not to create further gaps and further fears and greater inconsistency in the nondelivery of services that allow people with disabilities access and inclusion within Australian communities.' Liesl and I regularly share conversations in our professional world about individual cases of neglect and gaps in delivery that impact on people with disability across the Central Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we met with VOICCD, a local disability advocacy group speaking up for and supporting people with disability in our community. The clear message we have heard is of the need to improve every aspect of the NDISâto fund, not to cut budgets, to improve the lives of people living with disability, is paramount. As Liesl says, 'People with disability need to know that our support workers and carers are absolutely trustworthy.' In my office on the New South Wales Central Coast we have been contacted by and have worked closely with 300 people who have had problems with the transition to the NDIS and with their plans. We try to work with the agency to resolve these issues. We, as Australians living with and without disabilities, need to know that a diverse cross-section of people with disability have a very clear voice in the NDIS and in the royal commission into violence against and abuse and neglect of people with disability. We want them to be active, included and full participants in Australian society. It is so critical to people in our community living with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so pleased to support the amendment moved by the member for Barton and I'm very pleased to acknowledge the powerful advocacy of Liesl Tesch. Liesl is a role model for all of us on the Central Coast and across Australia. Liesl is a former teacher, a Paralympic gold medallist and a New South Wales state parliament member for the Labor Party. We need more people like Liesl representing our diverse community, our inclusive community, so that we can be a community where everybody can fully participate, an inclusive community that is strong and diverse and reflects the whole of our community. Liesl, you are an inspiration to all of us. It is such a privilege to consider you a friend and a colleague. I am so pleased that you could be here today in the federal parliament to hear this important debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to the House today about this critical issue in our community. I want to acknowledge and recognise the work of our shadow minister, the member for Barton, who has the heart, the empathy, the compassion and the know-how to change this. It must be better. It matters, and we must make a difference. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  The last time we were in this parliament, the Minister for Families and Social Services stated that the NDIS was now serving over 250,000 people across Australia and the Prime Minister touted that the scheme was one that provided choice and control for disabled Australians. At the time of that statement, the government had extended question time in what was widely believed to be a deliberate attempt to delay a vote on the establishment of a royal commission into the abuse of disabled Australians. What neither the Prime Minister nor the minister responsible discussed during the many opportunities provided during that sitting fortnight were the 184 incidents of abuse and neglect reported to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, the 62 reports of expected or unexpected deaths, the 91 reports of injuries, the 34 complaints against staff and providers, and the 75 cases of unauthorised restraint. All of these were in just the three-month window between July 2018 and the end of September 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as legislators, have a duty to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. If we won't show the leadership that our communities expect, then we condone the poor behaviour of others through our wilful blindness: the behaviour you walk past is the behaviour you accept. However, the government eventually relented its opposition to the royal commission, and I note the recent announcement that the government will commit the resources needed to ensure a thorough investigation of the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exploitation of vulnerable people was set out in excruciating detail at the royal commission into institutional child sex abuse and the royal commission into banking and financial services. No doubt, we will uncover further abuses in the royal commission into aged care. The abuses may have been prevented if only we had shone a light on these issues earlier and if we had listened to those who had spoken out and given a voice to those who were too afraid to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the Prime Minister's commitment to investigate the abuse and neglect of people with a disability, and I am pleased to see the government taking action through the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Worker Screening Database) Bill 2019 to prevent others from suffering the same fate. The bill will enable the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to establish and maintain a nationally consistent database for worker screening of people who provide NDIS supports and services through a registered NDIS provider or for those who self manage. Current worker screening arrangements are state based and vary in quality, with some states not recognising clearances given by other states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS commission will be responsible for maintaining the database, which will record all cleared and excluded applicants from all states and territories. It will also enable national ongoing monitoring of cleared applicants' criminal history records to ensure that worker screening units can assess and respond in a timely manner to the risk posed to participants. This is an important step forward in ensuring that NDIS participants are treated with dignity and respect, and in protecting their welfare as vulnerable members of our community. However, there is a long way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work of individuals, such as the former member of the South Australian Legislative Council, the Hon. Kelly Vincent and Senator Jordon Steele-John, who have long campaigned for the rights of disabled Australians.</span>

The government is committed to implementing its response to the financial services royal commission. This bill is an important part of our commitment. It will ensure that financial products are sold to the right consumers and that ASIC is empowered to intervene in order to prevent consumer harm.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a new design and distribution obligation for financial products. These obligations will require product issuers to determine an appropriate target market for their products and distributors to take reasonable steps to ensure that those products are distributed accordingly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides ASIC with a new product intervention power that will allow the corporate watchdog to make interventions in relation to a financial product where it identifies a risk of significant consumer detriment. These crucial reforms build on the substantial steps already undertaken by the government to protect Australian consumers. They deliver on our commitment to ensure that consumers are treated fairly by our financial system. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on the amendments that are being moved to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention Powers) Bill 2019. Labor was always very supportive of this legislation. I'm actually even more pleased to be here speaking on the amendments, because they do make some important changes that will help protect Australians from dodgy conduct by financial providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the House to be under no illusion though. These are Labor's amendments. They're amendments that we pushed for the moment that the design and distribution obligations bill was presented into the House, and, in fact, the government fought them for a long time. I do want that to be understood for the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Labor called for initially was for products such as buy-now pay-later to be included in the scope of the bill. We wanted the government to include dodgy funeral expenses products in the bill and we wanted credit providers to be covered by design and distribution obligations under the bill too. I'm very glad the government has come to the table with these amendments. It's better late than never. Unfortunately, it does reflect the very slow and lazy attitude towards regulating financial misconduct that we've seen from the government over a long period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor initiated a Senate inquiry into this bill. That inquiry, led by Labor, proposed the amendments that are being put forward by the government today. The government senators in the other place actually opposed that report where Labor recommended the changes that are before us. Since then, this bill's been languishing on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>âand, every week, my office looks eagerly to see whether it might be listed for debate and discussion in the House. But the government has refused, time and time again, to bring it on for debate. It is almost as if they've been hiding the bill for fear of what we believe is a commonsense approach to getting fairer outcomes for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the government's record on these matters. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into a financial services royal commission. Those on the other side, instead of siding with ordinary Australians, did everything they could to stop the big banks from being subject to proper accountability. They voted against a royal commission 26 times and, instead of fighting for ordinary Australians, they used their energy to push for $17 billion in tax cuts for the big banks. It's very unfortunate that that attitude bled into the way they've handled this bill. This is another sorry entry on the government's appalling record on financial services. It demonstrates a complete lack of judgement by those opposite. It's a government that refuses to lead and, instead, time and time again, as we've seen on these crucial issues of financial services, is actually being led by the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will implement recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne which were belatedly accepted by the government after the Hayne royal commission report was finally handed down. The amendments will allow ASIC to properly regulate the products that I've described and help to better protect consumers from harm. They should always have been in the scope of the bill, and Labor pushed the government for months to agree to some accommodation to the changes that we were suggesting. The amendments will bring consumer credit products such as credit cards, personal loans and home loans within the scope of the designer distribution obligations. When you think about it, it is utterly bizarre that, under the government's original bill, banks would have had to prepare target market determinations for a basic deposit account but not for a credit card and a home loan. That's how wrong they got it on the first go. ASIC called for the changes that are being made today, Labor called for the changes and the royal commission backed us in. It was only then that the government folded and said it was going to agree with the suggestions that Labor was making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments before us will implement two other recommendations that arose from the Labor senators' report from the Senate inquiry into this bill. Under the government's original bill, companies are liable to compensate consumers if they do not review or properly implement a target market determination. However, they are not required to compensate consumers at all if they've failed to make a target determination in the first place. This amendment will fix that loophole. If a company fails to make a market determination when it's required to, consumers will be able to access compensation for any loss as a result. It's only logical that some of these changes be made, and I'm very pleased to be on my feet and supporting the amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point I'll make is that the amendments that the government is putting forward today are in part implementing some of the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission. What we've heard from those on the other side of the chamber is that the royal commission is too hard and that we've got to do so much consultation and we've got to wait, delay and obfuscate before we get on and implement the royal commission's recommendations. Well, here we are in the chamber, right before the eyes of the Australian people, starting to implement its recommendations. All that shows us is that if this government really cared about financial services, if they really cared about protecting Australians from the big banks, they would have called the parliament previously and we'd be implementing more of those recommendations right now.</span>

This government is committed to supporting hardworking Australian small businesses, improving their cash flow and helping them invest and grow. That's why we're increasing the instant asset write-off threshold from $20,000 to $25,000 and extending it until 30 June 2020. The increased threshold applies from the announcement on 29 January 2019 and will benefit over three million eligible small businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million which employ around six million workers. The changes mean that small business will be able to immediately deduct eligible assets costing less than $25,000. More expensive assets will continue to be added to the small business depreciation pool and written off under those rules. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Reforms No. 1) Bill 2019. This bill follows the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance, which Labor tasked with investigating concerns about the petroleum resource rent tax regime. The government commenced shortly after their own review, which was led by Mike Callaghan. The bill gives effect to some of the government's response to that review of the petroleum resource rent tax, or the PRRT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill lowers the uplift rates that apply to certain categories of carry-forward expenditure and removes offshore petroleum projects from the scope of the PRRT. The petroleum resource rent tax is a profits based tax on petroleum production. A person is subject to tax on the taxable profit they receive for a year of tax in relation to a petroleum project. The taxable profit is the person's assessable receipts less the sum of their deductible expenditure and exploration expenditure transferred to the petroleum project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Categories of deductible expenditure are: general project expenditure; exploration expenditure; resource tax expenditure, which is grossed up by the PRRT rate of 40 per cent to give credit for royalties and excise paid on a petroleum project's output; acquired exploration expenditure and starting base expenditure, which recognises investments made in projects that transitioned to the PRRT regime; and closing down expenditure, which can give rise to a refundable credit to the extent of prior PRRT liabilities. PRRT liabilities are calculated on a project basis, meaning deductible expenditure can generally only be used to offset assessable receipts from the same petroleum project and generally cannot be transferred to other projects of the taxpayer. Exploration expenditure is an exception to this principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the future second tranche of amendments will seek to implement during 2019 other changes announced in the government's responseânamely, improved rules will be introduced to identify petroleum projects to ensure the true scope of each project is recognised; more corporate groups will be able to access the benefits of grouping, including group lodgement obligations and broader access to functional currency rules; greater certainty will be created for deductible expenditure arising before a petroleum project starts to derive assessable receipts by taxpayers being required to lodge an annual PRRT return, and receive assessments, after they start holding an interest in an exploration permit, retention lease or production licence rather than when they start generating assessable receipts from production; taxpayers will be able to use a substituted accounting period for PRRT purposes if they have adopted the period for income tax purposes; there will be a new power for the tax commissioner to administratively exempt projects from PRRT obligations where they are clearly unlikely to pay PRRT in the foreseeable future until they start production or the PRRT becomes payable; and the PRRT general avoidance provisions will be strengthened to reflect changes made to part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Petroleum projects generally experience periods of negative cash flow during exploration and construction before a project becomes cash flow positive. Taxpayers may carry forward unutilised expenditure to offset future positive cash flow periods. This is a principle that's long been established in Australian taxation law. The PRRT applies an uplift rate to carry forward expenditure. The uplift rates are specific to different types of expenditure. Given LNG projects are characterised by long development time lines, this increases the delay between the initial investment and positive cash flow. This in turn increases the total uplift applied to expenditure over the course of the project. The Callaghan review found that PRRT uplift rates for deductible expenditure are now overly generous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes the following changes. For petroleum projects that successfully apply for a production licence from 1 July 2019 based on the date specified in a production licence notice, the general expenditure uplift rate will be the long-term bond rate plus five percentage points until the financial year 10 years after the financial year in which a project first derives assessable petroleum receipts. From that financial year, the uplift rate for remaining deductions will equal the long-term bond rate. For exploration expenditure incurred or transferred from 1 July 2019, the uplift rate will be the long-term bond rate plus five percentage points until the financial year 10 years after the year in which the expenditure was incurred. From that financial year, any remaining amount of exploration expenditure is maintained in real terms by applying the GDP factor until the expenditure is deducted. Where exploration expenditure incurred before 1 July 2019 is deducted within a petroleum project, the current uplift rate equal to the long-term bond rate plus 15 percentage points will continue to apply until 1 July 2019. From that date, the uplift rate will equal the long-term bond rate, plus the five percentage points will apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of onshore petroleum projects, the PRRT originally applied only to certain petroleum projects in Commonwealth waters. Onshore projects were subject to other resource taxation arrangements, including state and Commonwealth royalties, crude oil excises and the resource rent royalty. From 1 July 2012, the then Labor government extended the PRRT to onshore petroleum projects, including coastal waters within the state and territory jurisdictions and at the North West Shelf. The Callaghan review found the extension of the PRRT to onshore projects also meant that these projects can transfer exploration expenditure to other PRRT paying projects within a wholly-owned group of companies, which is likely to have lowered PRRT revenues in 2012. This bill would remove onshore petroleum projects from the scope of the PRRT. Onshore petroleum projects are generally not expected to result in PRRT liabilities but can reduce taxpayers' PRRT liabilities for offshore projects because of the transfer of exploration expenditure.

Our multinational tax avoidance approach is stronger than the government's, we're closing tax concessions that relate to negative gearing and capital gains tax that have overwhelmingly benefited those that are well off and we are also making a fairer regime when it comes to taxing family trusts.</span>

The Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Reforms No. 1) Bill 2019 implements key components of the government's response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Petroleum resource rent tax review</span>, undertaken by Mike Callaghan AM, PSM. Since the PRRT was introduced, in 1988, Australia's petroleum industry has changed, shifting to a greater role for liquefied natural gas, LNG. Schedule 1 to the bill lowers the uplift rate that applies to exploration in general carried-forward expenditure. This prevents excessive compounding of deductions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill removes onshore projects from the PRRT. No PRRT has ever been collected from onshore projects. In practice, onshore projects that would never pay PRRT have been able to transfer exploration deductions to offshore projects, reducing revenue. Onshore projects remain subject to state taxation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  It's not my intention to try to detain the House for very long, but I do appreciate the opportunity to outline Labor's position on the Aged Care Amendment (Movement of Provisionally Allocated Places) Bill 2019. The Aged Care Act is to be amended, as, in its current form, it does not permit a variation of the region to which residential aged-care places are provisionally allocated. My understanding is this bill will allow the Secretary of the Department of Health or her delegates to allow approved providers of residential aged care to move provisionally allocated residential aged-care places from one region to another within that state or territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Health is not seeking the power to move provisionally allocated places from one state or territory to another. This bill will not allow the movement of any provisionally allocated places outside the state or territory to which it was originally allocated, and I put that on the record to ensure that that does not occur because we understand that that's not allowed under the bill as it has been drafted. We understand that, under this amendment bill, providers must demonstrate the movement of the provisionally allocated places is in the interest of aged-care consumers and that there is a clear need for places in the new region being proposed. The amendment bill will seek to ensure that residential aged care is available as quickly as possible to those older Australians who require it and is appropriately allocated to address local needs. There appears to be no financial impact for the Australian government by these proposed amendments, because those places are allocated through the ACAR rounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not my intention to detain the House, and Labor doesn't want to cause any issues or delay this bill going through, but I do need to put on record that, after almost six years of cuts in the aged care portfolio, any announcements that are made tonight in relation to aged careâand particularly in relation to home care packagesâwill not fool older Australians, their families or their loved ones. Let's be really frank about this: the government has mucked up aged care to the point where it had to call a royal commission into the quality and safety of aged-care services in this country. We all know that more than 128,000 older Australians are currently on the waitlist for home care packages; 69,000 of those have no package at all allocated to them at this point in time and the others are on interim packagesâthat is, packages below the level of support that they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government of course has made some announcements in the last few months in relation to aged care and home care packages, but let's not forget the cuts that they made to aged care. I do want to put them on the record: $110 million cut to the dementia supplement in residential aged care, almost $500 million cut in the 2015 MYEFO and a $1.2 billion cut to the aged care funding instrument in the 2016-17 budget. The architect of these cuts, almost $2 billion worth, was the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently it was revealed how the $1.2 billion cut has had an impact on the residential aged-care sector. We are hearing about it all the time. Departmental briefings confirmed that residential aged-care funding has gone backwards for those with complex needs. Departmental briefings described older Australians as 'winners' and 'losers' and revealed for the first time that funding for those with complex healthcare needs in residential aged care went backwards as a result of the Prime Minister's $1.2 billion cut. Funding for residents went backwards and staff cutbacks and aged-care 'losers'âaccording to the departmentâtripled. So let's not shy away from the fact that this government has taken billions of dollars out over six years, and any announcements tonight and over the next six weeks are not going to make up for those billions of dollars cut and the neglect of and lack of focus on aged care until the last few months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest: the government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to deal with this aged-care issue. It has only been because of the families who are contacting the offices of members of parliament every day trying to get reasonable aged-care services for their parents or their family members. Every day, my office and other offices in this place are taking calls from people desperate to get their loved ones home care packages. It is about time the government did something about this. It has been leaked to the Sunday papers to say that there are going to be home care packages in the budget tonight. That is welcome, but it's really not going to fool older Australians into thinking that this government does care about older Australians or has been focused on them for the last six years, because we know, with all the internal chaos and division, the government has been only focused on itself. Any increases tonight in home care packages will be really about the government trying to save itself and not about older Australians.</span>

Integral to this is supporting approved providers to make residential aged-care places ready for use as quickly as possible. The comments that were offered by the shadow minister are not a true reflection of the reality that has occurred since the Productivity Commission report. The challenges that are embedded in the aged-care sector arise from the time of the Productivity Commission report, the choosing of its recommendations that Labor, at the time, thought were appropriate, and inadequate funding that has been provided over that period of time. In addition, at the time, there was a reduction to the bottom-line budget by Labor over three consecutive years. I won't go into the level of funding. It was never put back in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our coalition government has focused on increasing the spend on aged careâ$5 billion in the last budget. There will be a continuation, in the forward years, of our commitment to improving the outcomes for senior Australians. The royal commission was not called because the system failed. The royal commission was called to address the structural flaws that exist within the aged-care sector. The commentary around the loss of funding is to do with inappropriate behaviour by providers against the budget that was set within the budgetary processes. Labor's continued claims were refuted by Fact Check on two occasions. It made it very clear that the statements were not the truth, because the budget for aged care has continually improved, and it continues to grow. </span>

                    </a>  The portfolio budget statements show the increase in budget expenditure by our government, unlike what the shadow minister says. We will take the construct and build it into a very simple process of providing the authority of the parliament to move provisionally allocated places to areas of need that are important, because, at the moment, we can't do that. This enables it. Constructing aged-care homes is a difficult, time-consuming and expensive exercise. It's not uncommon for providers to finish their aged-care homes with fewer rooms than originally intended, due to either planning or construction issues. Where this is the case, the Aged Care Act needs to be flexible enough to allow these leftover places to be moved to another suitable location.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, a provider may find a more suitable or affordable location for an aged-care home a few minutes drive away from the planning region to which the places were originally allocated. Again, the act needs to be flexible enough to allow this. The amendments within this bill add to the flexibility to act by allowing provisionally allocated residential aged-care places to be moved from one region to another where a provider can demonstrate that the movement is in the interests of aged-care consumers, that there is a clear need for places in the new region and that it is not detrimental to the region to which the provisionally allocated places are currently allocated. This change is in the best interests of all older Australians and the broader community. It will remove a potential barrier to the community accessing residential aged care, thereby aligning with the government's commitment to ensuring delivery of high-quality aged-care services when and where they're needed. I thank the members and senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  I rise to speak to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management and Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019. Labor have serious concerns about the cashless welfare card, and we oppose its rollout nationally. We have always opposed a national rollout of the card. Labor have always said that we will support evidence based approaches to addressing the challenges that these local communities face, and we will do it in consultation and partnership with these local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends funding of the cashless debit card trials in Ceduna, the East Kimberley and the Goldfields until 30 June 2020. The trials in these areas are currently scheduled to end on 1 July 2019. There is also a trial in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay; however, the end date for that trial is already 30 June 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also extends the funding for the Cape York Welfare Reform initiative until 1 July 2020. That funding currently expires on 1 July 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that, if a community want to try something new to tackle social issues, it's not for this parliament to stand in their way. For this reason, Labor supported the introduction of the trials in the first two trial sites, Ceduna, in South Australia, and the East Kimberley, in Western Australia. However, Labor have not been able to satisfy ourselves through our own consultations that this same community desire was present in the other trial sitesâthat is, the Goldfields and Bundaberg-Hervey Bay. For this reason, Labor did not support the introduction of the cashless debit card to the other trial sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Prime Minister reported to have confirmed today that the election could be as late as 25 May, the timing of this bill puts the parliament in a really difficult position. I want to stress that the timing puts us in an incredibly difficult position. That is because, regardless of the people's position on the cashless debit card, funding for communities is likely to run out in a matter of weeks. Without any prospect of sorting out a transition to alternative arrangements, this could be very disruptive to those locals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has included in this bill the extension of the Cape York Welfare Reform initiative, an approach which does have a level of community support and which cannot be simply left unfunded in a matter of weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the introduction of the cashless debit card trials, the government has continually failed to be up-front about the full costs of implementing the cashless debit card. In addition, Labor has become increasingly concerned about the Liberals' persistent clinging to the deeply flawed ORIMA evaluation. The Prime Minister and his conservative government have continued to use this report to sing the praises of the cashless debit card and mislead Australians about the extent of its success. Leading academics have referred to the comments made by the government as 'extremely misleading' and 'perplexing'. The Auditor-General found deep inconsistencies with the ORIMA evaluation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must stop relying on this report to justify its increasingly outlandish claims about the success of the cashless debit card trials. At a recent Senate inquiry into this bill, the committee heard evidence that in some trial sites the way the cashless debit card has been rolled out and the period it has been in operation preclude a proper piece of evaluation of its impact. We are no longer talking about trials in some sites but a government that is looking to entrench a policy without proving that it works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have now been a number of inquiries into the cashless debit card scheme and the committee has continued to hear mixed evidence about the card. Some think it has been beneficial to their communities. Others think it has made existing problems worse. Indigenous leader and Foundation Chair of Australian Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne Professor Marcia Langton has said the cashless debit card is a failure. She said because the local community was not involved in the policy, the policy failed. One of the community leaders in Kununurra who initially supported the introduction of the trial, Mr Desmond Hill, has since withdrawn his support. Mr Hill told the committee that one of the conditions community leaders had, when agreeing to the East Kimberley becoming the trial site, was that people should be able to apply to leave the trial. Another Indigenous leader in the East Kimberley, Ian Trust, who remains a supporter of the cashless debit card, told the committee that he was not opposed to people being able to come off the card in some circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has failed to properly provide this option. People who do the right thing have been unfairly stigmatised by being forced to take part in the cashless debit card trial, which is targeting behaviours that they themselves don't engage with in the first place. Labor will move an amendment in the Senate to allow people to get off the cashless debit card in certain circumstances. The amendment will allow people to come off the card if they can demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their financial affairs, taking into account these points: the interests of any children for whom they are responsible; lawful behaviour; risk of homelessness; health and safety of the individual and the community; the responsibilities and circumstances of the participant; and engagement in community, job search and work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Local community panels will be responsible for approving applications for people to leave the trial, but, where a panel is not in place, the Department of Social Services will make the decision. At its recent inquiry, the committee heard from a number of witnesses about the lack of evidence supporting broad based, compulsory income management. It has been revealed that the government itself, or at least the Public Service, certainly acknowledges this. Late last year, in a document presented to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Australian government wrote: 'There are more positive results associated with people who volunteer, as they have made a choice to change their behaviour and receiver assistance. Positive results have been found by a social worker or a child protection officer.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anti-Poverty Network SA told the Senate committee about a woman they had met in Ceduna who used to be able to purchase things online. Because of the cashless debit card, she is no longer able to do so. The network told the committee that this woman was never drunk and never had drugs or anything like that. It's just an inhibitive way of life for her now. Why should someone who has never engaged in binge drinking or taking illicit drugs be forced onto a cashless debit card that was introduced to address these behaviours? The answer is simple: they should not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We call on the government to vote with us in the Senate so that people who do not need to be on the cashless debit card no longer have to be. Labor has never supported the rollout of the cashless debit card nationally. We will not proceed with the government's plan to roll out the card and its harsh policies, including across the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not support the expansion of the cashless debit card and this form of income management to new communities unless the community wants the card and there is informed community consent. I want to really emphasise that just for a moment. Labor does not believe that parliaments or governments should stand in the way of communities who are properly consulted and give informed community consent if they want the card. That is not our role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, where the rollout of the cashless debit card is only partially implemented, Labor will stop the rollout and take a case management approach to putting in place alternative support for people already on the card and invest in support services and programs that work, if we are afforded government. In Ceduna, the East Kimberley and the Goldfields, where the rollout of the cashless debit card is complete, Labor will work with local communities to establish whether there is ongoing community consent. Where necessary, Labor will work with communities on alternative supports and programs, acknowledging that there are serious and complex social issues that will require commitment, time and resources to address. At all times Labor will consult properly with the local community, and we acknowledge that this will take some time. Labor will take an evidence based approach to policy and to income management. We will not demonise social security recipients, like this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I re-emphasise that we will seek to move an amendment in the other place that will give the capacity for people to come off the card in certain circumstances that I have outlined. If those circumstances are met, there will be a local community panel in place that can facilitate a person coming off the card. Where there is not a panel in place, it will be done through the department of social security. That is, in essence, the amendment that we will move in the upper house. I do hope it is successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We very much recognise that in Ceduna, the East Kimberley and the Goldfields, where the rollout of the cashless debit card is complete, it would be extremely disruptive to cease those trials now. Given the timing of the coming election and the uncertainty around that, we believe that we are taking the responsible approach in continuing those trials for a set period of time and, hopefully, if the Senate amendment is successful, giving people who do not need to be on the card the capacity to come off the card.

Paul Fletcher MP, the Minister for Families and Social Services. The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management and Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019 extends the cashless debit card program for a further year in the first three sites of Ceduna, the East Kimberley and the Goldfields under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. This will allow the cashless debit card trial to operate in all sites until 30 June 2020. The bill will also extend income management in Cape York for a further year up to 30 June 2020. These measures aim to reduce the devastating effects of alcohol, drug and gambling abuse. The evidence shows that it is working, with reductions across the board. The continuation of the cashless debit card and the Cape York Income Management demonstrates the Morrison government's commitment to providing a sustainable social welfare safety net, reducing social harm in areas with high levels of welfare dependency and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities. I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate. I see the member for Grey in the chamber, who has been an advocate and a strong supporter of the trial site in Ceduna.</span>

Each year, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the draft budget estimates of the PBO and Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to both houses of parliament.

                  </a>  I'll miss you too. It is to protect the independence of the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Office and make transparent any changes which the government may then make to their budget, which will be handed down in just a short while. It's a baseline, if you like, for members and senators to measure the appropriation given to these offices. The respective acts of the Auditor-General and Parliamentary Budget Officer, as well as the committee's own legislation, require each of those officers to provide to the committee all information that would assist the committee in making its recommendations to the parliament. So I rise today to fulfil this requirement and make a statement on whether the committee considers that the proposed funding for these officers is sufficient to carry out their respective mandates, and I'll go to each in turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, has advised the committee that it is not seeking supplementation in the 2019-20 budget, but it has advised that the ANAO expects that it will require new policy funding in the future, which is a change since last year. The Auditor-General has advised the committee that approval has been sought for an operating loss in the 2018-19 year, by virtue of accessing the prior year's unspent appropriations, to meet resourcing pressures. The ANAO's operating loss amounts to $3.13 million, plus depreciation of $1.46 million, for a total operating deficit of $4.6 million. This will be funded from the ANAO's accumulated reserves. The ANAO has estimated that its total ordinary annual appropriations from government will be $69.8 million for 2019-20. That's the baseline, if you like, that members can consider the budget documents against. The ANAO has advised that its transition to a new way of working will require a total investment of $13.2 million over two years, including capital investments of $11.9 million and $1.3 million in operating expenses for accommodation and IT related costs. The committee endorses the proposed budget for the ANAO in 2019-20 and thanks the ANAO for the professionalism it continues to demonstrate in supporting public accountability and transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the committee has been informed that the Parliamentary Budget Office has sought supplementation in the 2019-20 budget to continue to support the current level of service that it provides to the parliament. The PBO's expenses for 2019-20 total $8.69 million, and if the funding is approved it will enable the PBO to maintain current staffing levels and to invest in additional data resources, specialist advice and software over the forward estimates period. The JCPAA has considered this request and wishes to convey to the parliament its support for the PBO's proposal and the confidence of the committee that this matter has been given full and proper consideration. In this context, the committee also wishes to again acknowledge the important work done by the PBO and highlight its contribution to both the parliament and the broader community in delivering independent and high-quality fiscal analysis and research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I also take this opportunity to emphasise the accountability of both the ANAO and the PBO to the parliament, and I'll choose these words carefully as the Chair is reading the same to the Senate. I've received advice from the clerks of both houses endorsing the committee's position that it is the responsibility of both the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer to provide the JCPAA with all the information necessary for the committee to consider their respective budget estimates. This enables the committee to fulfil its responsibility to appropriately advise the parliament on the budget submissions put forward by both agencies. To not dwell on that, I just refer members to my personal explanation which I made to the House last May, which may explain the importance of and some controversy over the committee's position, given a bit of a debacle that happened last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the committee will continue to closely monitor the work programs and draft budget estimates of the PBO and the ANAO. The committee is strongly of the view that, as independent authorities and officers of the parliament, the PBO and the ANAO need to be sufficiently funded to fulfil their legislative requirements in order to fulfil their obligations to the parliament, and the committee looks forward to seeing the details of their respective budgets when announced this evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final matter is the appointment of an independent auditor of the ANAO. Under the Auditor-General Act, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required to approve the appointment of a new independent auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. The Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act requires that the committee report its decision to the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can confirm to the parliament that the committee has approved the appointment of Ms Eileen Hoggett as Independent Auditor of the ANAO. The Independent Auditor is appointed from outside of government to act on a part-time basis to serve as an external auditor to the Audit Officeâthe auditor who audits the auditor, basically. As KPMG's national partner in charge of external audit and chair of KPMG's audit committee, Ms Hoggett brings suitable experience to this important position, and the JCPAA looks forward to seeing the results of her work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While noting Ms Hoggett's experience and suitability for the role, the committee has also communicated its view that, at the time of the beginning of the process of appointing the next independent auditor, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet should explore ways to seek applicants for this position from a wider group of possible applicants, not just the big four accounting firmsâto look at SMEs. The committee has also recommended that, at the next review of the Auditor-General Act, this matter be given closer examination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 form the principal bills underpinning the government's budget. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of approximately $58.5 billion. This represents seven-twelfths of the estimated 2019-20 annual appropriations, and new measures since the 2018-19 additional estimates process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now outline the significant items provided for in this bill. First, the Department of Defence will receive almost $19.8 billion to protect and advance Australia's strategic interests through the provision of military capability, the promotion of security and stability, and the provision of support to the Australian community in accordance with government direction. Included in this amount is funding to support ongoing major defence operations, including operations Okra, Accordion, Highroad, Resolute and Manitou.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the Department of Social Services will receive approximately $5.7 billion, including funding for: the Commonwealth's contribution to the Fourth Action Plan to prevent violence against women and their children; the expansion of the cashless debit card to tackle drug, alcohol and gambling misuse; and the establishment of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the Department of Health will receive approximately $6.3 billion to continue to strengthen health services for all Australians. This will include funding for new medical research, including: administration of the Medical Research Future Fund; better mental health and drug and alcohol support services, including the expansion of the national headspace network; further support for improved access to quality aged-care residential and home-care services; and workforce priorities, improved access to medicines and implementing the Sport 2030 National Sport Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  This legislation, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Craft Beer) Bill 2019, is parallel to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Supporting Craft Brewers) Bill 2019. In those bills, the government is legislating amendments to the Excise Tariff Act and the Excise Act to extend concessional rates of excise to brewers that supply draft beer in kegs or other containers that have a capacity of eight litres or more. This bill contains separate amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to the measure concerning imported draft beer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some in this House may remember that, in June 2017, I introduced a motion in support of the craft brewing industryâsupported by many people on both sides of the parliament, it must be saidâcalling for legislative change to benefit our craft brewers. These people are small businesses. They operate now at the rate of a new one every six days in regional Australia, our cities and suburbs all around. They're employing locals, providing entertainment for local communities and providing jobs and economic growth. The fact is that the industry was being disadvantaged at the federal level by poor legislation related to the excise rates faced by independent brewers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I and the member for Hunter held a very effective forum at Wayward Brewing Co. in Camperdown in my electorate, during which we worked out a strategy and a campaign. I'm pleased that that campaign has been successful in delivering one step on the road to reform, because currently the rate of federal excise charged for a keg containing 50 litres of beer is less than the rate charged for a keg containing 30 litres. This does not make sense. In addition to this, the maximum tax rebate a brewery could receive per calendar year is $30,000. This compares, for example, with the wine industry's producer rebate, or WET, of some $350,000. One of the reforms that has occurred by regulation recently is to increase that to $100,000. That increase means literally every year a small craft brewing company, usually employing perhaps eight, a dozen or 20 people, is able to have $70,000 extra cash flow for their business and are able to employ more local people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Prime Minister and the government for adopting Labor policy on this measure. We've seen a number of Labor policies adopted tonight, it must be said, and this is just another one. Indeed, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and we take that on this side of the House. I thank those people across the parliament who campaigned for this reform, many of whom were on the backbench.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this isn't just a matter of economics. The difference between a 50-litre keg of beer and a 30-litre kegâand the reason the tax treatment disadvantages smaller craft brewersâis that a publican is far less likely to say, 'Yes, I'll give your beer a try and put your keg on,' if they have to have a 50-litre keg rather than a 30-litre keg because they'll always sell more of the mainstream productsâCarlton or VBâthan they will of a craft beer. The fact is also that many of the operators have told me it distorts employment. Because a craft brewery is not mechanisedâunlike a mechanised, big operation run by a Lion Nathanâif the craft brewery wants to employ someone, the employee has to be able to physically carry a 50-litre keg of beer, which is a real challenge. That distorts the people who can work in the industry, so there are employment implications that are very important as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The excise problem is that all beer of any alcohol percentage contained within a keg of over eight litres but below 48 is still taxed at a higher rate at the moment than kegs over 48 litres. This is because of historical overhang. The fact is that craft brewing is a relatively new industry at scale, but what we're seeing is that it doesn't matter whether it's in Grafton or in the Gold Coast or in Marrickville or in Wagga Wagga; right around Australia, this is a growing industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Excise Tariff Amendment (Supporting Craft Brewers) Bill 2019 is legislation that shouldn't be packaged alongside other bills to pass both houses, as that one has been. The government tried to push their agenda by including the bill with irrelevant legislation which, put simplyâif you excuse the punâdoesn't pass the pub test. It was included with the be Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019 that's about superannuation and allowing an increase in the maximum number of allowable members in self-managed super funds from four to six. It is unfortunate that the government put together bills that aren't related in an attempt to try to slide this through. Labor referred the bills to a Senate inquiry because of the lack of a relationship between the two pieces of legislation. I'm pleased that the coalition has seen the error of its ways and that the government has ensured that changes to the brewing sector can be finalised without debating unrelated and, frankly, unnecessary changes to self-managed superannuation funds. As a result, this legislation should be able to pass both houses of parliament and come into effect from the beginning of July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of June 2018, there were some 547 independent breweries operating in Australia, and the sector continues to grow. The Independent Brewers Association has reported that each brewery employs an average of seven people. That is some 4,000 jobs and counting. Furthermore, independent breweries constitute 97 per cent of all licensed breweries in Australia. What really matters, though, is that 65 per cent of independent breweries are located in rural and regional areas of Australia, such as the Little Rivers Brewing Company in Scottsdale, Tasmania, which I visited with the member for Bass in 2017. This is a brewery that has become the centre of the local community. It's where people have birthday parties. It's where people have functions to celebrate anniversaries. Like in many places around Australia, it really is a focal point for that local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationwide, the craft brewing sector was estimated to be worth some $518 million in 2018, an extraordinary increase of well over $100 million in the space of just two years. This is not to mention the potential for export value, particularly in Asia to our north. In China alone, it is estimated that the market for premium beer will be worth $35 billion in 2020. We have been very successful at exporting wine to the region, and there is no reason why we can't be just as successful with beer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow tourism minister, I can say that craft breweries are an important attraction as well. In my electorate, Dave's Brewery Tours book out well in advance. They book out some months in advance if you want to go on a tour on the weekend, and that's not surprising because in my electorate alone you have Willie the Boatman, the manufacturers of Albo Ale, and you have Batch Brewing, Sauce Brewing, Sunday Road Brewing, Wildflower, Young Henrys, Wayward Brewing, The Grifter, Malt Shovel, Akasha, Rocks Brewing, Staves, BlackFont Brewhouse and Stockade. It is, indeed, the craft beer capital of Australia, and I'm very proud. It is to craft beer what the Barossa Valley is to wine. Indeed, this time, instead of a campaign launch for the local election in Grayndler, I'm having a 'can-paign' launch on 24 April at Willie the Boatman. Albo Ale is going from long-neck bottles into cans, so we're combining the two events and having a 'can-paign' launchâperhaps, dare I say, Australia's first ever 'can-paign' launch. The fact is that this is an important industry. It's important for jobs. It's important for tourism. It's important for our economy. It's good that the government has recognised that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude with the words of Frank Zappa, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ you can't be a Real Country unless you have A BEER â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is indeed a real country. Beer is a part of our cultural history in this country. We should give support to those small businesses that are doing the right thing by their local communities by creating jobs and taking risks to make sure that those businesses are able to grow and thrive into the future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Craft Beer) Bill 2019 amends the Custom Tariff Act 1995 to lower the rate of the excise equivalent customs duty applied to beer imported in containers of between eight and 48 litres. Currently, beer imported in containers that exceed 48 litres is subject to a lower rate of excise equivalent customs duty compared to the same beer imported in smaller containers. So this bill extends from 1 July 2019 the lower excise equivalent rate currently applied to beers in containers over 48 litres to beers in containers of eight litres or more, provided the container is designed to connect to a pressurised gauge or pump device system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 correspond with the proposed amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, which applies to the equivalent domestically produced goods. This means imported goods will continue to be subject to the same tax treatment as the equivalent domestically produced goods. Lowering the excise rate for domestically produced beer in containers between eight and 48 litres will allow craft brewers, who typically use these smaller containers, to benefit from lower rates. Extending the lower rate for improved beer will ensure that Australia is fully compliant with our international commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the support of Labor for such an important bill. In particular, I would like to make mention of craft brewers in my electorate. Recently, Scenic Rim Brewing, one of our many craft brewers, was nominated by the Scenic Rim Regional Council for the business excellence awards. They will appreciate this bill that has gone before the House and been accepted by both sides wholeheartedly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:37</span>):  The Treasury Laws (Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Supporting Craft Brewers) Bill 2019 are parallel to the Customs Tariff Amendment (Craft Beer) Bill 2019 debated by the House earlier. That bill contained the separate amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to measures concerning imported draught beer. With these bills, the government is legislating amendments to the Excise Tariff Act and the Excise Act to extend concessional rates of excise to domestic brewers that supply draught beer in kegs or other containers with a capacity of eight litres or more that are designed for use with pressurised gas delivery systems or pump delivery systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments made by the bills apply to relevant goods entered for home consumption on or after 1 July 2019. From the outset, I want to note that Labor supports the amendments to the excise regime as it affects craft beer. I also want to note that it is my belief that none of these reforms would have happened without the campaigning and advocacy of Labor membersâin particular, the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler, who has been intensely passionate and advocated for this sensible reform for many years, to the extent that he now has his own craft brew named after him in his electorate by Willy the Boatman. And I've got to say it's not a bad drop. I think it's the ultimate accolade for an Australian politician to have a beer named after you. It is something that Hawke's Brewing Co. in my electorate of Coogee have done in honour of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and it is now something that the member for Grayndler has to his name as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's annual consumption of beer has been declining in recent years. Despite this, the craft brewing industry is growing strongly and has taken nearly 10 per cent of the national market. The industry is worth about $400 million a year and, according to Austrade, there are about 200 small breweries throughout Australia. The research shows that people in their 20s and 30s in particular are attracted to boutique brews for their variety of tastes, as well as the fact that they are produced locally in their own communities and that they support employment and jobs in those communities. Craft beer looms as an economic opportunity that we cannot afford to ignore. Excise accounts for about 46 per cent of small brewers' costsâalmost half of the cost to actually produce the beer. This makes no sense. It must be reviewed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a huge potential in craft beer tourism, whereby operators set up walking tours where enthusiasts visit several breweries to sample different types of beer. Craft beer tours are already available in Sydney's inner west as well as in Adelaide and Melbourne and other parts of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government caught up to Labor in 2018-19 in the budget, when there was included a measure to reduce the excise rate on draught beer and containers between eight and 48 litres designed to be connected to pressurised gas or pumped delivery systems to bring them into line with the lower excise rate currently applied to containers of 48 litres or more. The measures aim to support small brewers of boutique beersâcommonly referred to as 'craft' beersâwho typically are unable to manufacture or market beer in containers or kegs of 48 litres or more. The current higher excise rate on beer sold in containers that are less than 48 litres means that these small brewers are at a disadvantage when competing with larger brewers, who typically supply their beer in kegs larger than 48 litres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some other non-controversial measures featured in schedules 3 and 4 of this bill. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to continue to provide Global Infrastructure Hub Ltd with an exemption from the liability to pay income tax on its ordinary and statutory income. Schedule 4 of the bill makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to legislation in the Treasury portfolio, and these amendments make minor technical changes to correct spelling errors and such. Labor supports these schedules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to make some quick comments about another issue which these bills deal with. Labor are always pleased to vote in favour of measures for which we've advocated. But I want to make this final observation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the non-controversial nature of the overall craft excise measures, the government sought to poison the parallel domestic tax bills scheduled to be debated after this bill with an unnecessary and unrelated measure relating to self-managed superannuation funds. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act to increase the maximum number of allowable members in SMSFs from four to six. Not only does it appear that no consultation was conducted with the SMSF sector regarding this change; the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services stated in a media update:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike Bill Shorten and the Labor party, who continue to unfairly target SMSFs, the Government recognises the valuable role SMSFs play in providing competition throughout the superannuation sector and the opportunity they provide Australians who want to take a more hands-on approach to their retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was ordinarily and originally looking to hold an uncontroversial measure supporting craft brewers hostage to a purely partisan and political policy that no-one asked for. The superannuation industry, the SMSF industry, didn't ask for this change. But the government tried to relate it to this craft brewers measures bill. And, as to that particular reform that I'm speaking of, Labor opposes schedule 1 of that bill. It's Labor's hope that the government removes that schedule and ensures that all related bills relating to craft beer pass as soon as possible, without controversy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:44</span>):  The electorate of Mayo is a hotspot for craft brewers and they are important in growing the tourism industry for us in our region. They complement our region's reputation for fine wines, gins, ciders and spirits. As a multitude of ministers can attest, I have been a very persistent advocate for a fair deal for the craft brewers in my electorate, so I warmly welcome the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019 and the related bill, which puts my key recommendation into law. I first wrote extensively to the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, about the unique challenges that craft brewing businesses face: a thoroughly complex excise regime and the resultant cash flow management challenges that put a brake on expansion plans; market access concerns with pubs and clubs inevitability giving preferential treatment to the big market players; and, critically, a higher rate of excise being levied against the smaller kegs that craft brewers prefer to use. It is ridiculous and fundamentally unfair that a higher rate of tax existed on smaller kegs than on larger kegs. Of the multitude of issues faced by craft brewers, I made levelling this playing field my primary objective. I followed up on my correspondence with numerous meetings with government and I lodged detailed questions in writing on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. Finally, unrelenting persistence and the value of reasoned and logical policy reform shone through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will come as no surprise that I warmly welcomed the government's decision and announcement to finally level this playing field. No longer would craft brewers have to pay more, simply because they wanted to ship their beer in smaller kegs. I know that I have not been the only advocate. I acknowledge in particular the member for GrayndlerâI do not have a beer named after me!</span>

                    </a>  Yet! I recognise the efforts of many in this chamber in getting a fair deal for craft brewers. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of Corinna and Frank from the award-winning Prancing Pony Brewery in Mount Barker. If you are in Mount Barker, please get along. It is a fantastic venue. They first approached me to discuss the challenges their sector faces. Corinna and Frank have spoken to me about how big a win these changes are for them and their business. The changes give them the opportunity to sell their products into smaller venues and have the occupational health and safety advantage of moving kegs that weigh 35 kilograms rather than 65 kilograms. This legislation is the culmination of the collective efforts of many in this chamber and beyond this chamber and I therefore commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Roads and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  Thank you. Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have made a contribution to the debate tonight. We have heard from those on the other side, who have espousedâand rightly soâthat they have a beer named after them. I have mentioned the Scenic Rim Brewery in my electorate before. Whilst I don't believe I have a beer brand named after me, they do have a line called the Fat Man, so it is quite possible that I do have some notoriety in that place!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019 has four schedules. Schedule 2 to the bill, together with the Excise Tariff Amendment (Supporting Craft Brewers) Bill 2019, extends supports to the craft brewers. Schedule 3 to the bill extends the income exemption for the G20 Global Infrastructure Hub for an additional four years. Schedule 4 to the bill introduces minor technical and machinery amendments to the Treasury portfolio legislation. I also foreshadow the government's amendments for removing schedule 1 from the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 would have increased from four to six the maximum number of members allowed in self-managed super funds and small APRA funds. It is regrettable that the opposition would not support a sensible change to that law and thus provide additional choice for flexibility for Australians to manage their retirement savings. The government continues to support this change and will seek progress on that at a later time. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Frydenberg:</span>
                </a>  The Minister for Finance and the Public Service has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(1) PSS and CSS indexed pensions are adjusted bi-annually by movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Age Pension payments are adjusted bi-annually by the greater of movements in the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index and the CPI. If the resulting Age Pension is lower than a prescribed benchmark against Male Total Average Weekly Earnings, it is adjusted to the level of the benchmark.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(2) CSS and PSS pensions and the Age Pension serve fundamentally different purposes. CSS and PSS pensions represent part of the remuneration package provided for Commonwealth employment. The CSS and PSS provide access to a lifetime pension and compare very favourably to the 9.5 percent Superannuation Guarantee applicable to most Australian workers. In contrast, the Age Pension is a welfare safety net benefit payment available to all Australians who meet the eligibility requirements. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the indexation arrangements for the Age Pension takes account of the living cost index for recipients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(3) While sympathetic to the difficulties that some superannuants face living on a fixed income, the Government considers that the Commonwealth civilian defined benefit schemes compare favourably with superannuation arrangements in the general community. The Government therefore intends to maintain the current indexation arrangements for CSS and PSS pensions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth has made significant contributions to the Future Fund to fund the legacy entitlements arising from the Commonwealth's defined benefit schemes. These fiscally responsible steps mean that the Future Fund is expected to have sufficient assets by the late 2020s to cover the Government's superannuation liabilities. Any improvement to indexation would increase the Government's superannuation liabilities. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(4) No financial modelling of the cost of changing the CSS and PSS indexation methodology has been undertaken by the Government.</span>
