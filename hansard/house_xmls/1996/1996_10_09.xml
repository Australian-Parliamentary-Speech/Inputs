       In the first instance, a motion was moved to effectively refer the private member's bill on euthanasia moved by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) to the Main Committee. In the second instance, a motion was moved by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in relation to his dissent from the then Deputy Speaker's ruling. Then we had the situation where the substantive motion—a motion of great importance and one on which I would have thought a number of members would have had a particularly strong view, in many cases—was effectively gagged. A number of members in this chamber who wanted to speak to that motion were prevented from doing so.

       I want to make a couple of observations in relation to the referral of bills to the Main Committee. When the Main Committee was established after an inquiry and report by the Selection Committee it was determined that the Main Committee would discuss matters of non&amp;hyphen;controversial circumstances—in other words, bills that would not involve great differences of opinion or involve, for instance, divisions or other motions    that may prevent the free flowing of the debate.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I was a member of that committee and I recollect making at the time a number of observations to this House about my concerns about the way in which the Main Committee might be used. We have already seen the Main Committee used under this and the previous administration for the debate of the appropriation bills. I would have thought under the circumstances that appropriation bills were of such significance and importance that it would be critical that they be debated in this main chamber of the House of Representatives.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Now we have the situation where probably one of the most important bills of this decade, Mr Andrews's private member's bill, has been moved to, effectively, the secondary chamber

       I listened with great interest to the shadow minister's contribution yesterday, and I consider that a number of the points he raised were absolutely right. There is no doubt in my mind from the debates that occurred at the time about the creation of the Main Committee that it was never designed to be a place where contentious legislation would be debated, and we never anticipated members being required to have split personalities, to sit in two separate chambers to keep themselves abreast of the progress of the debate on bills before the House of Representatives. They may even want to speak on legislation in both places. Not only is that illogical and absurd but it goes against the very nature of the purpose of debate in this place.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As we know, debate in the House of Representatives has unfortunately evolved over many years into a situation where there is a set piece debate. People effectively know at what time they are likely to speak and can therefore prepare a written speech. They walk into the chamber, give their speech and leave the chamber. That is their contribution to the debate. At the end of the entire process we then have a division if that is required. In most cases, the question is carried on the voices.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       To my way of thinking, that is precisely the opposite of what most people in the community believe we should be doing. They believe that we should be in this chamber debating the legislation and we should arrive at a point of view on the basis of the material that is presented to members during and before the debate in things like the explanatory memorandum and other papers and from our own reading and then at the conclusion of the debate vote accordingly. We all know that in effect this place is the plaything of the executive.

       I want to make a couple of observations about the backbench of the government. Having been a former member of the Liberal Party and a former deputy whip I am quite conscious of the processes of that party and I say to the large number of members of the

       On this particular matter you are being required to toe the line on executive action which is completely inconsistent with the expectation of your electors. Your electors expect you to debate this matter to the best of your ability, to listen to the debate and to come to a conclusion based on your conscience. How the heck can you do that when there are bills being debated in this House which require your attention, your participation and you to make a determination on as the representative of your constituents.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This is what executive domination of the House is all about—the bludgeoning of debate or the bludgeoning of any particular differences of opinion through the force of numbers. When it comes to the question of whether the constituents in your electorates are uppermost, the fact is that the executive could not care less about your constituents unless you happen to be in one of the most marginal seats that may be critical to them winning or losing at the next election. Considering the enormous victory the coalition had at the last election, chances are, in many cases, those interests have been discarded because of the large majority.

       At the end of the day, we all have a responsibility to our constituents. We have to think, listen, read, participate and be able to make a contribution that reflects their interests. How can this be so when we are required to participate in a debate on a piece of legislation at the same time that legislation of importance, part of the government's program of legislation, is being debated in this chamber.

       Some of the new members may not be aware that in the first period of the parliament generally there is not that considerable pressure that may exist in the latter stages of the parliamentary term or, for that matter, a parliamentary year. In the first six months we have seen examples of oppression and the cutting off of opportunities for people to be able to participate in debates. I worry about what is going to happen towards the end of this year and, more importantly, what is going to happen as the government starts to get towards the end of its first term and has still got legislation in the pipeline which it needs to get through in order to complete its program.

       The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and I have suggested on a number of occasions that one of the answers is for the House to sit more frequently. The object of the Main Committee was to keep the House's time relatively free by moving non&amp;hyphen;contentious legislation, often recurrent legislation, to the Main Committee so that those members who wish to make a contribution in that debate can do so and they can represent the interests of their constituents while, at the same time,

       Yesterday we were all gagged from contributing to the particular motion by the motion of the Deputy Leader of the House, the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran)—a member whom I have heard on numerous occasions extol the virtues of parliamentary democracy. He has frequently criticised the previous government's incompetence with their legislative program and on many other occasions has pointed out how the way in which the government managed its business was against the rights of individual members to represent their constituents. Unfortunately, the member for Gippsland has moved down the same path as the previous government. That is very disappointing to me, because I know that he is a good member who wishes to represent his constituents well. But, of course, he too is a victim of the oppression of the executive. He must abide by their decisions. He was sent in last evening to gag the rest of the debate and to prevent us from having our contribution.

       This government came to office promising to raise the standards of the House of Representatives. It went to the people saying that the standards had declined in recent years, and that the opportunity for the people to be represented properly had been taken away by the Hawke-Keating administrations and by their use of various tactics and instruments of the House to stop debate and to circumscribe those opportunities. Unfortunately, all those sentiments that were expressed during the election campaign and in the first stages of this parliament have started to dissipate.

       We are now seeing ourselves back to what the situation was before—I should really say back to business. In fact, to a certain extent, it is worse in that, because the Main Committee was a relatively late phenomenon in the term of the last parliament; the Main Committee had not developed sufficiently for the previous government to be able to use it in the same way. We are now seeing similar traits appearing in the government's management of business now.

        In conclusion, I urge the government to reconsider the way in which it has moved to have debate on the euthanasia bill of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) referred to the Main Committee and return it to this chamber. I know that there are a number of members who are right now considering to boycott the debate because they consider that the matter has been treated in an offhand manner by being moved to the secondary chamber. I hope that does not take place; I hope that it does not come to that. But I can well understand the frustration of members who believe that, because they are not one of the first few speakers on the list, they are required to go and make their contribution in the secondary chamber and not here in the main chamber of the House of Representatives, which is where they ought to be making their contribution.

The long-term implications of the conduct of this House yesterday, led by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the House (Mr McGauran), is that the basis on which the Main Committee operated has been destroyed.

       I take the opportunity to make some comments about the referral of the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee by way of suspension of standing orders. Let the House clearly understand the history of this matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) actively, publicly and privately, solicited a private member's bill on this matter. He put his arm around the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and said, privately and publicly, that he would ensure an appropriate debate on euthanasia.

Yesterday we saw the Prime Minister, who says that he attaches himself to the dignity of the parliament and who says that he attaches himself to the standing of the parliament in the community, conniving with the Leader of the House to gag debate on two separate occasions to send off the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee and overriding the basis upon which the House established the Main Committee; namely, that one member, one voice of conscience, one voice of dissent, could stop a controversial matter going to the Main Committee. The House should also understand that, through this conduct yesterday—led by the Prime Minister's proxy, the Leader of the House—the trust which this House has had in the Main Committee has been destroyed.

        I was one who, until today, had taken the view that it was actually appropriate at a particular stage of debate for the appropriation bill to be referred to the Main Committee. Once the main debate had occurred in this chamber and the clash of ideas and policy had been seized, I had the view that it was appropriate for the appropriation bill to be referred to the Main Committee. This was a view not shared by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), and he put this view to me. I have to say to the House today that, with hindsight and in light of what occurred yesterday, the member for Curtin was right. It is not appropriate for the appropriation bill to be referred to the Main Committee. As a consequence of the conduct of the House yesterday, the basis upon which the Main Committee has operated to date has been destroyed. I am afraid that what we will see is that the Main Committee will effectively cease to operate.

        Members of this House should understand the implications of yesterday's debate.

        I will conclude by making a couple of points about some of the debate yesterday. In the course of the debate, the Leader of the House made the assertion that he had an agreement with this side in respect of the debate about the euthanasia bill. He also referred to a meeting that was held amongst interested parties. I was at that meeting; the Deputy Leader of the House was at that meeting—the Leader of the House was not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me tell the House the facts about that meeting. Firstly, there could be no arrangement with both sides of the House in respect of how the euthanasia bill would be processed because that matter was a matter of individual conscience, both as to substance and procedure. No-one spoke to me about those matters prior to the meeting that was held amongst interested members. At that meeting, I put the view strongly and firmly that this was a matter which was not appropriate to be dealt with by the Main Committee. I made it quite clear—the Deputy Leader of the House confirms this by nodding—that I would utilise the provision in the standing orders to refer it back to this chamber.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a direct consequence of that, we saw the Leader of the House table his motion. There
        <break page="5001" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         was no attempt by the Leader of the House, or the Deputy Leader of the House or anyone else to try to bring this matter to a full, appropriate or agreeable conclusion. The Leader of the House dropped a notice of motion in the dead of a Thursday night thinking that he could get away with it, and then proceeded to diminish the parliament, destroy the euthanasia bill and destroy the Main Committee by way of suspension.

        If the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister were serious in any way about trying to raise the standard and the dignity of this parliament, of trying to raise the manner and the appreciation of members of this House, then the Prime Minister ought to have fulfilled his commitment. He touted for the euthanasia bill. He told the member for Menzies that he would sponsor it; that he would make time available. Instead of making time available, what did he do? Through his proxy and agent, the Leader of the House, he gagged debate in this House on two separate occasions, he diminished this parliament, he destroyed any chance of a sensible parliamentary and community debate on euthanasia, and in the process he has destroyed the Main Committee. He has done great damage to the opportunity that this House had in this parliament to raise its standards, to raise its dignity and to conduct itself in a manner which the community regards as appropriate.

        —As a new member of this House, I have to say that yesterday I saw this House spend 4&amp;half; hours debating procedural bits and pieces and nothing moved forward. None of the business of this country moved on. That probably cost the Australian nation about $50,000 or so for no outcome. I think it is time we realised, as members of this place, that we have to stop delaying important government business. We have to get on with the job.

        —Like many members of this parliament, I have received countless letters, phone calls and delegations from citizens in my electorate who are urging me to take a position one way or another on this important legislation. I say to my colleague who has just sat down—the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay)—that it was the government's decision to bring this debate on. It was the government's decision to raise the question in this parliament for debate and to have a conscience vote.

       There is a real difference between a normal debate and a debate in this parliament which is broadcast and where each individual member can take his own position, express his view on behalf of his electorate, or express his personal or private view, and then vote. The importance of that is that, if we are going to carry out this process, we owe it to the people of Australia, our constituents, to let them know precisely what we stand for individually in terms of our responsibilities as members of this House.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I believe the government erred when it decided to refer this to a committee room where the processes that have been adopted unanimously by this parliament say, `What goes there are non&amp;hyphen;controversial matters.' That process was established for what purpose? It was established for the very important purpose that, where parliament was agreed, there was a quick, simple process where members could express themselves if they so chose, and we moved items of legislation. It was never designed or conceived as an exercise to debate an issue of conscience which requires and enables each member in this place to express his own views or the views of his electorate and to take his vote on a non-party basis. That is an important process.

       The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who brought this on, is now saying that he wishes he had never heard of it. If he wants to get rid of it, let him have the guts to come out and say so and take it off the

Then we will all come back in here and take our vote.'

       I have made my decision. I want to participate in this debate, and I want to participate in it in the parliament. If that right is not going to be accorded to me, I believe members of this parliament who respect this institution should say to the government: `We will not participate in this debate. We will not vote in this debate. We are not going to be party to your sleazy backroom deals. If you do not want it on, have the guts to pull it out.' Do not go through this shoddy procedure, which is a perversity for an institution representing the territorians. I have spent more hours with the Territory governments than probably any ex-minister of this place or most members of this place. They have made up their minds. They know what they want. In the Northern Territory they are entitled to hear the views of members of this House.

       If the government does not want to do the right thing and have it in this institution, it is the government's problem. They can deal with it in any way they like. I am not going to waste my time mucking around in a backroom chamber which is not available to the people of Australia or to the people of the Northern Territory with an issue in which people feel as morally involved as any member of this House. They are entitled to hear the views of their members.

        —I will not trouble the House for very long. One of the dilemmas faced in this whole issue is exactly what happened to me last night. I was in the Main Committee speaking on the Budget Papers—and that is another question, as to whether or not that should have been up there—when this debate took place. Therefore, I did not have an opportunity to express my view in this House as to what I felt about the procedural motion. I have expressed that view by voting the way I did last night. But, stripping this whole issue of politics, my constituents wanted me to vote the way I did because they want to hear this debate on radio. They want to be able to come to the chamber to listen to it if they can travel down and they want to be involved in the process. I want to hear the contributions of every member of this House because that is part of the process on arguably the most sensitive matter to come before this House in 20 years. That is why I voted the way I did. I do not for one moment back off from that. I regret the fact that I did not have the opportunity, because I was in the Main Committee last night, to contribute to the motion.

         —I support the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill and I oppose the amendment. I listened for some time to the previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), on this matter. Although she was speaking to the amendment—the debate is fairly wide ranging—there are a couple of points I should make about her speech.Firstly, in relation to this measure and child&amp;hyphen;care issues generally what the government is really on about is the question of choice. She may not be aware of it, but a lot of women out there would prefer not to work. They would prefer to have quality time with their children and not to have to make arrangements to place those children in child care.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am reminded of my own sister, a highly qualified woman who had been working in an executive position in the education system. She has a young child of two and has had a tremendous amount of anguish about child&amp;hyphen;care arrangements. It has ended up recently with her taking a year off work without pay so that she can be with her son. That has created a tremendous economic consequence because she is married to a painter in the railways. As you can imagine, he is on a very basic wage. She has exercised that choice, but it has not been an easy choice. The problems she has encountered with child care—her son has been regularly sick because of his exposure to other children—forced her to make that very difficult choice.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are obviously women who exercise the choice the other way. That really is what the issue is about: it is about the exercise of choice. In my submission, government legislation on this matter is providing choice for families and giving them the chance to be brought in from the cold when, for so long, they have been left out in the cold.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill will provide significant tax relief for approximately two million low and middle
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         income families. This delivers on a promise made during the election campaign. In effect, it will give an eligible parent tax advantages arising out of a lifting of the tax free threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child. These measures are important.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Very often we hear from the other side that this is not a major measure by any means and that it will really do very little, and then arguments are put about the downside of other measures in order to try to detract from the key measure. But I can tell you, from discussions that I have had with some of my constituents, that this is a very welcome measure. We must always be mindful that assistance to families in these circumstances—the low income family and particularly the family with a child under the age of five years of age—provides real benefits for them. What has really surprised the opposition in this whole debate is that there is a government out there that is interested in the low to middle income families—the families that have been left out in the cold by decision making over a number of years by the previous government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where a family has one breadwinner and has at least one child under the age of five, there is a further increase in the tax free threshold of $2,500. In effect, for a one income family with two children, one of whom is under five, this will deliver an extra $34 per fortnight. Recently I had a family visit me and I explained this measure to them. They were quite delighted that this small amount of extra money would provide much needed assistance to them in their week to week existence. Those on lower incomes with children really do struggle in today's society to keep that extra advantage for their children, that extra little bit, which may well provide a weekend camping trip away with the kids—just some little extra thing. This measure will assist their own family budget and will benefit families in that situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The initiative will be delivered through the PAYE system, the provisional tax system, or a claim can be made on assessment. For low income families, equivalent fortnightly cash assistance, to be called the family tax payment, will be available as an alternative.
        <break page="5008" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Eligible families will receive assistance of around $7.70 per fortnight for each eligible child. In addition to this, single income families with young children will receive a further $19.20 per fortnight. For example, a single income family with two children, one under five, can have tax reduced by about $34.60 a fortnight.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are helpful and significant benefits. It is a recognition by the government that people in this situation who have been crying out and who have had their cries unheeded for a considerable period are now being listened to by government. In particular, this government is delivering on a major package which will cost about $1 billion. If the family is also claiming the full rate of the new incentives for private health insurance, available from 1 July 1997, the total assistance in the package will be more than $50 per fortnight—a significant advantage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is my view that over the previous 13 years the Labor Party increasingly moved away from its own constituency. This measure indicates that the party that really is looking after that constituency much more than the Labor Party ever did is the coalition. The constituency I refer to is frequently the blue-collar constituency and those on low to middle incomes who at the last election voted with their feet because of the way they felt the Paul Keating government had treated them. In my own electorate of Dickson, families felt that the previous government were prepared to nod their heads but pay mere lip&amp;hyphen;service to their needs. It is all very well, as we heard a lot in the last 12 months or so from the previous government, to say, `We will be a government that listens,' but it is no good listening if you do not act. It is no good nodding your head and saying, `Yes, we're listening to you,' and then go off in another direction. This particular measure involved not only listening but also developing a policy and fulfilling that policy in our first budget in difficult economic circumstances—circumstances where difficult decisions had to be taken in the total budgetary context.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am particularly encouraged at the support given to single income families. I emphasise
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that so much of that group of people has been neglected over the years. That neglect has ultimately led to the other partner of the family going out and seeking to get work. That is done often at a social cost. We have recently heard of the cost that is occasioned in social terms and the anguish that is occasioned to families who have to, as a matter of necessity, go out and earn income in order to put bread on the table, keep the mortgage in shape and also have a reasonable standard of living for their families.

        I do not think people choose to make those arrangements deliberately because somehow or other there is a greater lure in going out and earning income than being at home and looking after children. It is a matter of necessity in so many cases. The government is trying in this measure—and, in my view, rightly—to recognise that there are families that have to do that, that there are families that would prefer not to do that and that this provides some mechanism for choice. That is what it is all about.

        Contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga said, the government is not about trying to railroad women back into the home. It is not about trying to railroad people into a single income situation; it is about providing choice and the sorts of circumstances where women—and men, for that matter—can avail themselves of full&amp;hyphen;time and part&amp;hyphen; time work so that they can balance the responsibilities of children. If the government can facilitate and be a reagent in this process so that the glue of the social structure can be workable in the total context, then in my view it is doing the right thing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, it is not a question of some sort of social agenda of trying to force women out of the work force back into the homes in some antediluvian drive to achieve some rather odd social end. As I have said, many people who have been forced to go out and work to keep their families have done so as a result of economic necessity—in fact I would suggest that most people have done it for that reason. I do not think many of them like doing it but they have been forced to.

         The measures in these bills recognise that there are people out there who are prepared to stay at home and look after their children. It must be recognised that that in itself provides enormous benefits to the community. One of the things you learn a lot about as a new member—and I am grateful for that—is the way the community organisations function. As someone who has always been in full&amp;hyphen;time work and not terribly in touch with a lot of the community organisations prior to being a candidate and a member I often got the feeling that everything was functioning quite well and there was an army of people out there who were prepared to do those community and sometimes very thankless jobs.

         In reality, when you get close to the situation, you realise that organisations such as Meals on Wheels and even the local tuckshop are frequently staffed by women who have exercised that choice to stay home and look after their children and at the same time provide a real service to the community. That has to be good in an overall social context. Those who are in work sometimes may have to be reminded that that is happening and that the women—and sometimes men—who are doing this voluntary, community work and exercising a choice to stay at home but also carry the load, as it were, in the local tuckshop, Meals on Wheels, Lifeline centre and so forth are helping the community overall and must not be forgotten.

        These pieces of legislation are commendable and reflect the commitment given by the coalition, by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the pre&amp;hyphen;election scenario to be family oriented. In other words, this was the pro&amp;hyphen;family component of the coalition's election manifesto. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, and I have debated for a long time how this type of initiative can be delivered. I know that in the past he had some strong views of his own about the way in which one can deliver family assistance—meaning assistance for families to be able to remain together, to

        Any family raising children is under financial pressure, even families who are on relatively high incomes. The parliamentary secretary in the past was responsible for proposing a number of initiatives as part of a family payment. I commend him for that because I know that he sincerely views family policy as critical to any government's program of legislation. I share his view. I think that those members of the government who view family policy as critical probably were the members responsible for attracting the most support for the government because, at the end of the day, the forgotten people of the Australian electorate were families raising children. When we think about the predicament facing our nation, the fact that we have zero population growth at the moment which will have a long&amp;hyphen;term effect on our nation's future, then one has to value very highly initiatives that support the very important function of families raising children who will obviously participate fully in our community.

        At the coalition policy launch it was stated that one of the greatest challenges of modern family life is to balance effectively work commitments and goals with family responsibilities and aspirations, that any credible family policy at a government level must be directed at helping families to achieve that balance, and that a coalition government would have this objective as one of its key priorities. I thought that was one of the most attractive features of the government's election manifesto. It was certainly one of the reasons why I, as an Independent, strongly supported the election of a coalition government. But at the same time I was conscious of the fact that there were commitments made during the election campaign that had to be kept because they were the commitments that attracted people to vote for the coalition. These were the things that people assumed, once elected, that the government would deliver. I will return to some of these later in my speech.

         its major objectives. I think every person, even people who do not pay income tax at all, would agree that the Australian taxation system is one of the most complicated, illogical systems around. It is absolutely mind&amp;hyphen;boggling. Anybody who is a friend or acquaintance of a tax accountant would be aware, no doubt from verbatim examples given by their friend or acquaintance, that taxation legislation and consequent decisions, opinions and rulings comprise thousands of pages of text. In fact, in order to accommodate all the material relating to income tax—and for that matter all taxes: wholesale, sales tax and the like—you would need several shelves to store them, and they would be groaning under the weight of all those taxation tomes and rulings.

These initiatives, which provide at long last some financial assistance to long-suffering families of Australia, are long overdue. The families of Australia are the cornerstone of our society, and recognition of that fact is demonstrated by the government's initiative as contained in these bills—another Labor injustice put right by the Howard coalition government.

         —I rise today to support the family tax initiative announced in the first Howard government budget. These initiatives will be of particular benefit to lower and middle income families, sole parents and single income families. Overall, almost two million Australian families with children will benefit from significant tax rebates as of 1 January 1997. I especially welcome this budget measure because it not only meets a major election promise made by the coalition prior to the 1996 election but also gives much needed extra disposable income to families.

        History shows that the family has been the core unit of most stable societies. For most of us, there is no stronger bond than the love we

         have for our families. Living with our family gives us our first experience of interpersonal relationships. It is from the family, particularly through the interaction we have with parents, siblings and others in our family group, that we are encouraged to communicate. Families teach us about responsibility, about care. The family is a microcosm of society. It is the respect we feel for our parents and grandparents that engenders respect for others, be they friends, neighbours, workmates or people we deal with in day-to&amp;hyphen;day life. From families we learn to have respect for those institutions that serve us and our society in general.

        Despite the known importance of families, under Labor these same families became Australia's forgotten folk. They were burnt by the brunt of Labor's mistakes for the past decade, thus joining the ever swelling ranks of the new poor. Practically every welfare group in Australia is able to relate horror stories about the queues of ordinary families who have been forced to swallow their pride and line up to accept charity thanks to Labor's mismanagement.

        There are some terrible tales of parents who, due to the mounting rise in the cost of living caused by the hike in interest rates during Labor's term in office, were unable to feed their children. Indeed, it was not unusual to hear of charities running out of food and blankets due to excess demand. Under Labor, families became second&amp;hyphen;class citizens. While the previous government pandered to every crackpot, yet politically correct fringe group, they forgot about or indeed ignored the plight of everyday men, women and children.

        We have all heard Labor's greatest lie of all that, `By 1990 no Australian child will live in poverty.' Yet by March 1996, when the people of Australia decided that enough was enough and voted the Labor Party out of government, many Australian children still lived in poverty. When I speak of poverty, I not only refer to people's lack of access to disposable income but also speak about the poverty of the style of leadership and good commonsense displayed by the government of that time. It was a government that was bereft of ideas, that had lost the plot, that had

        History records that earlier this year Australians turned to the coalition in their droves, and we have heard their plea. This government's aim is to raise people out of the poverty traps into which they have fallen due to no fault of their own. It is our duty to give people back their self-respect, to reward the battler who has kept going through the toughest of times and to assist those who have struggled through 13 tough years always toiling to pay their monthly bills to help their families survive. ABS figures show that people are now working longer hours just to make ends meet. May 1983 labour figures show the average person worked 38.9 hours per week. By May 1996 the average person was working 42.4 hours per week.

        Over the past decade many mothers have been forced to go back to work in order to clothe their kids. Before the election very few families could afford to survive on just one income. As a mother who works, I obviously support a woman's right to enjoy a career should that be her choice. But I do not believe that women who would prefer to stay at home to  raise their family should be forced to return to work to take any job no matter what in order to be able to purchase the basic necessities of life.

         plight of families. Our family tax initiative gives something back to mainstream Australia. We are looking after those decent hardworking men and women for whom life is a daily struggle. For some, the grind of daily life becomes just too much. As hard earned wages pay for less and less, tensions within marriages and relationships grow and parents separate. A sad outcome of this is that children then suffer the distress of losing regular daily contact with the other non-custodial parent.

        In addition, our communities inherit the problem brought about by dividing up a wage that was barely enough to support one family grouping into one which now needs to support two quite distinct households. A family that was scratching to survive then breaks down due to the hopelessness of the battle to cope. Such family break&amp;hyphen;ups very often cause bad feelings and despair. That once cohesive family unit now becomes a social security statistic and a further drain on society as it descends into the pit of poverty. The scenario I have just described is not unusual. The last decade has seen divorce on the increase, with the consequence that families are torn apart.

Even when you can convince your children that they do not need the latest in vogue fashion accessory—and that is sometimes harder than negotiating a Middle East peace agreement—clothing children still costs a fortune. If necessary, mum and dad will always go without, but we should not have to deprive our children of their needs.

        Schedule 2 of the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 introduces the new family tax payment, which we announced as a pre-election promise. Part A provides for an increase in the tax free threshold for one parent of $1,000 each child. This translates to an increase in disposable income of $7.70 per child per fortnight. Part B directs additional assistance to single income families, including lone parents, with at least one child under the age of five. Part B will provide an additional

        Let me give the House an example of how this bill will benefit a typical family in my electorate of Canning. A couple has two children, one aged under five. One parent earns 35,000 per annum and is the family's sole income earner. Under the family tax package, the parents will receive a $900 tax cut, the equivalent of $34.60 per fortnight. If this family chooses to take out private health insurance, then they will be entitled to up to $450 per year to help pay the premiums. This then amounts to an overall annual benefit of $1,359, or an extra $51.90 per fortnight.

        These changes are eminently fair. They let the people of middle Australia know that we are concerned about them. To the people for whom daily life is a struggle just to balance their family budget and to make it go far enough, these increases in disposable income will allow some much needed breathing space. These initiatives permit families the opportunity to plan. They go to those families who need them most and will allow them to pay for extras such as school camps, clothes, that extra pair of shoes, an outing to McDonald's and other special family outings—all those little extras which usually fall outside the scope of a regular budget.

        You can imagine what will now happen. As families begin to be able to spend more, they will stimulate their local economy and by so doing they will indirectly be instrumental in providing more job opportunities for people. Importantly, the effect of the proposed changes to the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill will be to improve people's everyday life. This bill will provide a better choice. Women who wish to work can do so. But it will also enhance opportunities for those women who would prefer to fulfil their dream to care for their family in an extra special way, to be there waiting when the kids come home from school.

        The family is the best welfare institution that we have. The family provides the strongest bond in our society. Care, compassion and concern are all an integral part of family life. Under Labor many people were forced to become dependent on the state to provide for their needs. In contrast, this government encourages a spirit of individualism and recognises the need to strengthen the family unit. We believe that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society. This bill delivers on that promise. This bill is good for the family and, most importantly, this bill will make Australia a far better place to live.

         —These family tax initiative bills first saw the light of day in the coalition's policy launch when, prior to the election, the coalition saw this as a method of winning votes in the election. According to them at the time, it was supposed to give low and middle income families a $25 boost to their income. The reality behind the opposition's thoughts on this bill, as mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), in her contribution, is that this is really one of the legs of the coalition's attempt to get women out of the work force. It is an unstated objective of this bill, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker in her speech, that more families will now be at home. In the main, we know that from the coalition's point of view having a family member at home does not mean having the bloke at home; it means having the woman at home. That is what they have always wanted. It goes back to the picket fences launch of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when Leader of the Opposition some years ago and it is the thread that runs through most of their policy arrangements.

        When we take into account the cuts to the operational subsidies for child&amp;hyphen;care centres, the increases in HECS fees, the up&amp;hyphen;front charges for nursing homes and the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program, if families are only getting another $25 to help them finance that, their family budgets will be very short at the end of the fortnight. I think the $25 so&amp;hyphen;called boost for low income families under the family tax initiative will now be used by those families to save up to get dental repairs done which they were previously getting done under the Commonwealth dental program.

        The abolition of the Commonwealth dental program has affected half a million low income Australians, many of them low income families. They were getting their dental care for free. What are they getting from the government now? They are getting $25, if they are lucky, to get the dentist to repair their teeth. The $25—and it is a big `if' as to whether they will get the $25—might be spent trying to cover those extra costs of child care that were introduced in this budget. The government gives with one hand and takes away with the other.

        The $25 will probably just about cover the extra $25 that a family will have to find to put a child under three into a long day care centre, because the government has taken away the subsidy for long day care centres. It is pretty bad luck for that family. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) refers in the explanatory memorandum to the bill to `Alison's family'. Usually, when governments come up with explanatory memorandums, they try to look for the people who will do best out of the proposal. Alison, according to the Treasurer in the explanatory memorandum, is a single parent earning $70,000 a year and has three kids. Honourable members should look at

        How is that $25 going to cover the extra $66 that a family on $30,000 will have to find if they need child care for up to 55 hours a week? That is what will happen to a lot of factory workers. If they need child care for up to 55 hours a week, they have got three children and, unlike Alison, they are not earning $70,000, they are only earning $30,000, the $25 will not help them very much at all.

I suppose this is really being helpful to that family!

They will have to pay an extra 50c without any compensating increase in their pension. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, the boost that the government talks about in

There will be cuts to tertiary education by the year 2000, which means there will be a 15 per cent funding cut to universities.

In this initiative they are going to give the young people, if they are lucky, $25 but what they are saying to their parents or grandparents who have to go into a nursing home is, `You had better find $26,000.' I suppose that is pretty generous in their view—`We will give you $25 a week but you had better go and find $26,000 so that granny or grandpa can go into a nursing home, without having to sell granny's house from underneath her.'

Members might remember—and the voters in the electorate of Lindsay might remember—that that was also the policy launch where the Prime Minister said he was not going to change any policies of the Labor government of the time and that we could trust John Howard as Prime Minister because when John Howard became Prime Minister there were going to be all those Labor policies for families—and the coalition would give a little bit more.

Indeed, my own son considered going to that university. It has a fairly good reputation. But kids in western Sydney under this government's plans—and the member for Warringah is saying how terrific the University of Wollongong is—are going to have to travel to Wollongong because there will not be any places at the University of Western Sydney. They will have to go to Wollongong from Kensington, Camperdown, Epping and North Ryde, and go to university there because there will be 1,000 fewer places at the University of Western Sydney—brought about directly by this government. And for the families of the kids from the west of Sydney, the people who live out in the electorate of Lindsay, their children who want to get to university and cannot get into the University of Western Sydney will have to travel all this way. When they have to travel all that way how far will that $25 a week extra that their family is getting for them help? It will all go on fares.

          Fortunately, the Labor government in New South Wales on the weekend announced they were taking the toll off the tollways in west ern Sydney, so we are making it a bit easier and a bit cheaper for people to go into the city while this government is making it very expensive. So the people who live out in western Sydney and are on incomes of $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000 probably all think it is pretty good giving something to Alison, who is on $70,000.

I think the government could have done better. The only score they will get for this is about three out of 10. They will not score anything from the people of western Sydney.

        This is the centrepiece of the government's budget, and nothing could encapsulate more the notion that this budget gives with one hand and whacks with the other. That is the substance of this budget. The centrepiece of the family tax measure which is before the House through the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill is effectively this: a tax benefit of $3.85 per dependent child is given to families; an extra $9.60 a week is given to families if a child is under five and the partner of the principal income earner earns no more than $4,500 per year, with the principal income earner earning $65,000 per year and $3,000 for each child after the first being the means test limit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The general $3.85 per dependent child is means tested at $70,000 plus $3,000 for each child after the first. So it is effectively $3.85 per dependent child. On the basis of the calculations that we have done regarding to whom this becomes applicable, as indicated by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), when he led the debate
        <break page="5021" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        When we look at the fine print of this bill, we find that the government proposes to give modestly with one hand and whack families with the other.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will go through some principal areas of concern to families: education costs, health costs, aged care costs, prescription costs, child-care costs and dental care costs. Let us have a very quick look at how education costs will go up. HECS has increased. Students will have to pay higher amounts and pay earlier. Austudy is cut. Assistance for students with disabilities has stopped altogether.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So far as health costs are concerned, many doctors will now stop bulkbilling because their fees will no longer be indexed to CPI increases. The potential extra cost has been calculated as being $10 per consultation—let alone the $800 million in outlays that the government has cut to hospital funding, which will presumably mean longer waiting lists and many more people being forced to pay for some of their operations. So far as prescription costs are concerned, the cost of listed
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         prescription drugs will go up from $17.40 to $20. Pensioners who are paying $2.70 will, as a result of the budget, pay $3.20.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So far as aged care costs are concerned, nursing home residents will face a new daily fee of up to $34—let alone the $26,000 up-front entry fee for nursing homes. Elderly people who live at home and use human and community care services, like Meals on Wheels, will incur a user&amp;hyphen;pays rate that is calculated as being anywhere between $4 per hour and $6.30 per hour. If it is the upper limit of $6.30 per hour and an elderly person who lives at home has three hours a week of Meals on Wheels services, then they are up for as much as $1,000 per year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as dental care costs are concerned, the Commonwealth dental health program has been abolished, which means that health care cardholders will either face long waiting lists for dental services or pay for private care. As far as child care is concerned, it is calculated that families will have to pay anywhere between $14 and $20 or $30 extra per week to use community based child care. Child-care funding is cut by about $500 million and the cost burden of that will fall on families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The EPAC study on child care which was recently released shows that, in EPAC's estimate, the operating subsidy, which the government proposes to remove, is worth $21.40 per week for children under three and $14.35 per week for children older than three. It is also calculated, on this side of the chamber, that a family on an annual income of about $30,000 with two children in long day care for 50 hours per week will pay an extra $19.60 per week. The same family earning $45,000 per year will pay $15.30 extra per week in child-care fees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, when you make all those additions and calculations, what you find is that this is a modest little package that gives $3.85 per dependent child. But, when you look at the fine print of the budget and legislation associated with it, you see that the devil is in the detail, the deceit is in the detail and the whacking of Australian families is in the detail.

        I have listened to opposition members speak in this debate today about the things that this coalition government is doing to the people of Australia. What the opposition did when in government between 1993 and 1996 was just unbelievable—the hypocrisy, the increases in wholesale sales tax ratcheted up year after year in the face of promises not to increase taxes and their walking away from the Keating promise of tax cuts.

        The excise on fuel was ratcheted up in the years 1993 to 1996. During the whole period of Labor in government, from 1983 to 1996, we saw the excise on fuel rise from something like 6c or 8c a litre into the mid-thirties. Little wonder the cost of every single thing we consume in this country is so high by comparison because of the hidden, indirect taxes. We may not have got a GST in 1993, but we got a KST—Keating sales tax—on everything across the board.

        He increased it, with a succession of Treasurers, on all products that had a wholesale sales tax. As well as walking away from the promise about the tax cuts, Keating brought in new products to put sales tax on. In 1996, the people of Australia did not forget the deception that was perpetrated on them in 1993. This government has taken on the responsibility of doing something about the structural fiscal problem we have in this country today which has a profound effect on the monetary situation and on interest rates.

        We have been taken to enormous levels of debt. Everywhere you go, the Labor line is that the $180 billion worth of debt is not government but private sector debt. Some $80 billion or more is public sector debt. A massive amount of that was built on during the last three years of the Labor administration under the prime ministership of Keating. They blew it out, and it was built on by deficit budget after deficit budget. `Deficit budget' is an easy term. Where does the money come from to pay that—the money that is physically being paid out for goods and services? It is borrowed. Where is it borrowed from? Overseas; it is on the bankcard.

They kept on accumulating deficit budgets. They were running very high current account deficits. Because of that high debt, the balance of payments figures each month were much higher than they should have been because of the component of interest that the government—as well as the private sector—was paying on that foreign debt.

It is time that we take responsibility for our actions in this country. When we spend a dollar there should be someone out there earning it and paying tax on it for the government to spend it.

        A previous speaker from the opposition raised the issue of the Commonwealth dental plan. That Commonwealth dental plan was probably one of many examples that the previous government entered into. That dental plan, as I recall, was cobbled together as a promise by the previous Prime Minister during the 1993 election campaign with no consultation with industry or the profession. It was unfunded. I suspect that at the time the former Prime Minister did not expect to win that election. Having won it, he was then faced with the prospect of what to do with that plan. He set a target, and those targets have now been met. It is a bit rich for opposition members to come in here and complain about that Commonwealth dental plan when they introduced it completely unfunded and, might I say, underfunded throughout its history.

        I want to concentrate on the family tax initiatives before us today. They honour one of the coalition's core election commitments: to help the forgotten families of middle Australia. We promised to help those families who have been battling to make ends meet under Labor and we are delivering on those promises in full. This relief package for families has been widely praised and welcomed in McEwen. Since the budget was announced, my office has been inundated with calls from families wanting to know more about the package, wanting to know whether they qualify for it, how much money it will actually put in their pockets and how they can access it.

A single mother from Healesville called my office to say that, with the extra money the family tax initiative would bring in for her, she was hoping to attend university and complete a degree so that she could get a well&amp;hyphen;paid job to help raise her child.

        There is no doubt that there are increasing pressures being placed on families as they try to juggle work and family responsibilities. As a mother of two children myself, I am well aware that trying to find the balance between work and parenthood is one of the greatest challenges I face. To add to the burden, there are the spiralling costs of rearing children. Education, uniforms, food, sporting involvement, social activities, clothes, shoes, school camps and excursions, child care, baby&amp;hyphen;sitters and travel and transport costs are just a few that I can name straight off the top of my head. Trying to cover all these expenses is difficult enough when you have one or both parents involved in full&amp;hyphen;time work, but when the parents are dependent upon social security benefits or are on low incomes the task becomes that much harder.

        Let us just examine the magnitude of the problem of families in need, families that represent those forgotten or passed over by Labor, those who have been denied the opportunity to get ahead and to have the means to look after themselves, those families that have been left behind by Labor for the past 13 years. Just under two million households in Australia survived principally on government benefits in the 1993&amp;hyphen;94 financial year, according to an Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey. That is 4.175 million Australians out of a population of almost 18 million.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Other ABS and Australian Council of Social Service figures show that just under 50 per cent of all wage earners earned less than $25,000 per year. Labor has failed those families. In May 1995, 1.9 million Australians were living in poverty, as measured by the Henderson poverty line, of whom 592,000
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         were children under the age of 14. UNICEF states that Australia is one of only five industrial nations to have more than 10 per cent of its children still living in poverty—and that is one of the real legacies of 13 years of Labor rule.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What did Labor do to reduce that poverty? What did they do to tackle the causes of that poverty over the past 13 years? Nothing but talk. Poverty actually increased under Labor during the past 13 years. Approximately 20 per cent of sole parents are under the Henderson poverty line. This increases to 30 per cent for single parents with three or more children. The circumstances for two&amp;hyphen;parent families are not much better, with the poverty rate at 12 per cent, rising to 22 per cent for families with four or more children.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are the families which our family tax initiative will benefit. It does not discriminate: sole parents, the unemployed, working couples and families where one parent chooses to stay at home all benefit from this package, and the more children they have the more they benefit. These measures are designed to alleviate the pressures of all of those families in middle Australia, those who have battled under Labor just to keep their heads above water.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I give another couple of examples. A family in Diamond Creek in my electorate of McEwen with a combined taxable  income of less than $70,000 will receive a $1,000 increase in their tax free threshold for each dependent child. This means an extra $200 per year or $7.70 per fortnight for each eligible child. A one&amp;hyphen;income family in Broadford will receive a further $2,500 increase in their tax free threshold if they have a child aged under five. This means an extra $500 per year or $19.20 per fortnight.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The advantage of this initiative is that families can select how they want to receive their payment. Parents can choose to receive their payment on a fortnightly basis throughout the year or opt to receive it in a lump sum at the end of the financial year. This initiative will put much needed dollars into the pockets of millions of households across Australia, making it one of the most substantial family relief measures this country has ever seen.

         This initiative will be of particular benefit to families in rural areas like many of those in my electorate of McEwen. The cost of raising children escalates significantly in rural Australia where basic goods and services are more expensive and often beyond the reach of many, where unemployment is high, where job prospects are low and where farms and small businesses have not yet recovered from the recession. The number of vacant shops is stark testimony to this and serves as a constant reminder that this is definitely not as good as it gets, as the former Prime Minister so arrogantly told those small business families.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Members of the opposition should realise that each of those empty shops used to support a family in their small business and, as well, provided extra local employment. In turn, those families were vital members of their local communities. They struggled in those small businesses for as long as they could but, thanks to the deliberate policies of the previous government, those small business families, their dependants and their employees have ended up without a job and dependent on government. They look to this government to give them that fresh start, and that is what this budget is doing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The money that this tax initiative will bring to many families in McEwen may well mean the difference between surviving and the constant struggle for survival. Many rural families are unable to afford the basics of living. The price of new shoes and clothes is significantly higher in rural towns than in larger centres. Fifty dollars worth of groceries will seldom cover the bottom of a shopping trolley. Many parents are unable to spare money for school camps and activities or sporting or social events, and family holidays are rare.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Most smaller country towns do not have child&amp;hyphen;care centres, so parents must either forsake a regular pay packet to stay home to look after the children or rely on families and friends. Parents in the country have to travel much greater distances to access essential services such as doctors, hospitals, supermarkets and government agencies. Without public transport, the responsibility of driving children
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to and from school, or the school bus, sporting events and social activities also falls back on the parents. The high cost of fuel in rural areas means travelling is an added financial burden on parents when raising their children.

         Even basic services which city parents take for granted cost more in the country. In rural Australia most telephone calls are charged at STD rates because of the small local call charge areas. Children in the country cannot access the Internet for educational purposes because in many rural areas calls to the services are charged at STD rates which make that service far too expensive for many rural families to use, even if the technology is available. Many country residents must also rely solely on electricity for their heating and cooking needs as they have no access to the cheaper alternative of natural gas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is easy to understand how, for many rural parents, just to provide the basic essentials for their children creates great stress, tension and pressure on families. These conditions that I have just described do not apply to isolated cases; they tend to be the rule rather than the exception. They apply to the majority of hardworking families trying to bring up their children. Their plight is the real legacy of 13 years of Labor rule where, under Labor, it was the interest groups which were well looked after, not families.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The primary aim of this family tax initiative is to reduce these financial pressures on families with dependent children so as to give them more choices when raising their children. This initiative will be complemented by a series of measures aimed at providing greater support and security to families and easing the cost of raising children. These measures begin the process of redressing the imbalance.

This depends, of course, on members of the opposition and the Australian Democrats being serious about helping Australian families by passing these budget measures.

        It is my conviction that tax reform should enhance the health of families by seeking to achieve two outcomes: firstly, choice for families, and particularly choice for women in families; and, secondly, horizontal equity between families. The quiet revolution of this century has been the increased number of women in the labour force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the last 20 years the central phenomenon has been the increased number of married women and women with children in the work force in this country. The entry of women into the work force is facilitated by demographic factors, urbanisation, labour saving domestic appliances, the availability of suitable employment—particularly part&amp;hyphen;time employment—vast improvements in the educational opportunities for women, economic incentives such as higher wages and favourable taxation for married couples, the availability of child care and a change in attitudes making it acceptable for women to work in this age. It was less acceptable for the parents of most of us in this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many studies show that the long-term determinants of female labour supply do no more than explain why it is possible for women to enter the work force this century in increasingly large numbers. It is the short&amp;hyphen;term determinants which explain why women avail themselves of the opportunities to work. These include economic pressure to work due to the fall in real wages for middle and lower income workers, the loss of employment at the middle level for adult males due to the economic recession and industrial restructuring, new standards of conspicuous consumption and the increasing cost of housing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The decision by women to enter the labour force seems more sensitive to economic incentives than the decision taken by men. It is a combination of these factors which has
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         led to a major change in the structure and the make&amp;hyphen;up of the work force in this country over the last three decades. This has had an impact on families as well.

        Many of the gains for women have been more apparent than real. Women are still clustered in the lowest paid work in strongly segregated industries. The commitment of women to the paid work force remains comparatively weak for married women and for women with children. Women in Australia work only a third of the hours that men work each year. Although women value work for the independent means it gives them, they also overwhelmingly choose to work part time or not at all when they have young children.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If we are trying to structure a tax system in this country which recognises those changes which have occurred in Australian society and which is providing choice about the opportunities to work for all members of the community, particularly married women and women with children who 30 years ago did not have the same opportunities—yet we are also keen to ensure that we provide a system which supports families and family life—then we need a tax system which reflects some of these changing realities.

        The second matter which I believe tax reform in this area should be based upon is the notion of horizontal equity. There has been in this country, since 1986 when tax rebates for children were abolished overnight, no recognition of horizontal equity in the Australian tax system. This means simply that there is no allowance made in the tax system for the greater costs incurred in bringing up children. In a 1990 study of 11 major industrialised countries, it was found that:

        Australia, by far, provides the least relief [in tax and cash grants] for dependent children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The costs of children are considerable and inescapable. According to one study, for a family earning $400 a week with two children under five years of age, nearly $74 a week was spent on the first child and just over $55 on the second; that is, $129 a week or $6,709 annually. That, in 1988 figures, represented 32 per cent of the family's income before tax. The figures, which have been updated since
        <break page="5030" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         then, show that there is an increasing cost of raising children in Australia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The former Director of the Institute of Family Studies in Australia, Dr Don Edgar, provided some figures which showed that a single breadwinner with two children on $42,900 a year has the same disposable income as a single person on $24,000 a year. That is, if you are in a family—a husband and wife, with one earner and two children—and you are earning $42,900 a year, at the end of the tax year your disposable income would be no more than that of a single person on $24,000 a year. This is notwithstanding the fact that single people on half average weekly earnings have ended up $10.43 a week worse off than they were in 1976.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        According to research by Alan Jordan on Australian incomes and relative living standards, which is the baseline for much of the research that has been undertaken in this area, the major economic division in Australia is not between classes but between households with children and households without children. According to Jordan's studies, families with children enjoy a real living standard or equivalent income which is three-fifths that of the rest of the adult working population. Equivalent income measures effective living standards by allowing for the sharing of monetary income between dependants, the different needs of adults and children, and economies of scale.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The increase in taxes on families has been well documented. Since 1960, the average tax rate for a single income family with two children has increased approximately 334 per cent, while the rate for a single taxpayer has gone up only 78 per cent. The tax transfer which has occurred under the Labor government from the middle to the top and bottom sectors has underwritten gains for families on below average weekly earnings and significant benefit for the wealthy top 10 per cent of Australians who have increased their share of market income by three percentage points over the decade of Labor government to 24 per cent in 1990. Those differentials have increased over the last few years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Conversely, those on average weekly earnings with two children are between $27
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and $34 a week worse off than they were in 1976. But the only income level at which families are significantly better off than a couple with no children is at the low income level of $15,000 due to the additional family payment and other benefits. The consequence of these studies is the finding that there is no net assistance from government to families with children as demonstrated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics fiscal incidence study, which analysed for the first time the total impact on government spending and taxing on Australian society, using data from 10,000 Australian households. Families with dependent children pay fully in their taxes for everything they get from local, state and federal governments, including the biggest item—education.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yet, seen in hard&amp;hyphen;edged economic terms, children are our most valuable resource as future workers. The bauxite will not be mined, the seas will not be trawled, the assembly lines will not keep running and intellectual products will not be created unless they, the future generation of Australians, do so. There is also the aspect of choice that I have touched on before, which has been largely removed so far as the system relates at the present time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The stated preference for many women with young children—I am talking about children of preschool age not to work at all or work only part time—has been shown by a whole series of studies in Australia over the last decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to one by Van and Hardle in 1991, 67 per cent of women want to stay at home with their children but only 47 per cent said that they could actually do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So there is a pressing need, as this measure tries to address, to build more choice into the taxation system by allowing parents to care for their children at home, especially in the years of nought to five when they are most in need of a stable loving environment. Although the costs of raising children do in fact increase with age, it has to be remembered that not only is one partner forgoing wages to care for children but also this is often the time when the household is being set up. The chief carer of the children is more able to work
        <break page="5031" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         when the children are older. Therefore, if support for the family is to be targeted, there is an argument—as this measure addresses—for directing it particularly to those families with children aged nought to five.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A number of options could be introduced in terms of dealing with more provision for families, but this one is one which I believe is preferable. I fully support the legislation for a number of reasons: firstly, it does achieve more horizontal equity for families; secondly, it is easily understood by Australians and it is not a complex arrangement; and, thirdly, the greatest benefits will be felt by low income families and those on average weekly earnings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a matter which was reported upon by an independent study undertaken by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, at the University of Canberra just in this past week. That study of this measure revealed that single income families will receive an average $10.50 more a week from the family tax package from 1 January next year. Double income families will gain an extra $5.30 a week on average and sole parents are set to get an extra $8.30 a week according to the study.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The author of the study, Gillian Beer, said almost two million low and middle income families would benefit. She also said that sole parents, at whom this measure is aimed as much as it is at families where there are two parents, would get an $8.30 a week boost that would lift their disposable income as a result of this measure alone by two per cent. Less than one&amp;hyphen;third of all families with children, which are mostly the higher income families, will receive no benefit under this measure. Quite clearly, this measure meets the objective that low income families and those on average weekly earnings are to benefit, according to the independent analysis carried out by NATSEM.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Importantly, there are arguments about how we can provide relief to families. This is not a welfare measure. One of the great difficulties in surveying the history of the way in which benefits are provided to families in this country is that, when they are treated as payments, they tend to be treated as welfare
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         measures. Over a period of time, they tend to be targeted by governments in such a way that the effect of them is narrowed, there does not tend to be the increase in the amount in line with inflation or the consumer price index over a period of time, and so the real value of the benefit decreases over a period of time. That is one of the drawbacks of welfare measures.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also the cost involved by governments raising money from parents through taxation, which then is churned through the system and has obvious costs in providing the bureaucracy to simply pay that money back to parents at the end of the day. There are arguments for doing that where governments wish to direct programs specifically in certain directions. However, I believe that more choice ought to be provided, and there are some economic advantages in not collecting money in the first place which is simply paid back to parents, but we pay the cost of collecting it and paying it back.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other advantage of this measure is that it can be provided immediately through the PAYE taxation system in a reduction in weekly tax. Therefore, it is something which, in a sense, has the same benefit as a payment which is directly made. Rather than simply being made by way of a cheque from the Department of Social Security or otherwise from the government, it can be seen in the pay packets of Australians at the end of the week or the fortnight or the month or whatever period of time they receive their pay.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Overall, this is a measure which, I believe, meets those objectives of being fair, simple and directed to those most in need and of providing some equity in the taxation system, particularly for families with children, while at the same time providing some more neutrality so that we do not have families believing that the only way in which they can maintain their real standard of living is to have a second income, either by being forced to have a second parent always in the full&amp;hyphen;time work force or by having one or other parent forced to go out and get a second job or work longer hours. I believe this measure is some small step towards trying to provide
        <break page="5032" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         some neutrality in the system and it is one which I commend to all honourable members.

        One of the very interesting features of this budget, a feature which should prevent members opposite from simply labelling this as a tory budget, is that we have been very careful to ensure that the burdens have been placed only on people who are able to bear them. That is why the Medicare levy has been increased for high income earners, that is why high income earners have had a surcharge added to their superannuation tax, and that is why child&amp;hyphen;care fee relief has been reduced for high income earners—because the hallmark of the first Howard budget has been fairness. That is why members opposite have had so much difficulty criticising the measures before us.

        For quite some time, families with children have been Australia's new poor. A single income earner on $30,000 a year has roughly $445 a week on which to live. A family comprising a single income earner with a dependent spouse and two dependent children has but $495 a week on which to live after tax, family allowance, home child&amp;hyphen;care allowance and so on. Under the system of tax and payments which was established by the previous government, such a family had but $50 a week extra with which to feed, clothe and educate those three extra family members. That is why, as I said, families with children are Australia's new poor. That is why the government has introduced this important package of family benefits.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not say for a second that this is going to solve the problems of Australia's families. It can't, obviously. But it is an important step in the right direction. It is a $1 billion package of benefits for Australia's families, and two million Australian families will be better
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         off as of 1 January next year. All families with children will benefit at least to the tune of $7.70 a fortnight, and families with more children will benefit much more significantly. For instance, a family with four children, of which one is under five, will benefit to the tune of $50 a fortnight. So these are very significant benefits which are being delivered to Australian families.

The second element gives single income families with a child under five an additional $2,500 benefit in their tax free threshold. Fifty per cent of families have children; 27 per cent of families have either one breadwinner, no breadwinner or a single parent. In other words, 50 per cent of all families will benefit from these measures and 50 per cent of those families will benefit from the additional measures for one income families.

        We also have an important equity measure there. We have reduced the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate for high income earners from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. In his contribution to this debate, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) quoted the marvellous old Salvation Army aphorism, `We are here to help the needy not the greedy.' That is precisely what the government is attempting to do.

In 1991, unemployment hit 11 per cent. During the life of the previous government, disposable income for the average household was $50 less in 1996 than it was in 1983.

        The fact is that members opposite all too often in this debate have sounded as though they begrudge Australian families the benefit that they so richly and so rightly deserve.

         —The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 is a very important bill. It gives effect to a large proportion of the savings announced in this year's budget that relate to the social security area. It adds up to about $1.5 billion worth of savings over the forward estimates period. It contains quite a number of measures which we in the opposition find objectionable. I can speak from my own point of view here, having been Minister for Social Security for three years and having gone through a number of rounds of the expenditure review committee and having seen some of these sorts of propositions emanate from the Department of Finance at various times, and some not, quite frankly. Some of the things that are proposed in here are not the sorts of things that even the Department of Finance would have put forward during our period of government.

        There is no doubt in my mind that a number of these measures will have a very adverse effect on Australia's social security safety net. In government we had no more significant objective than to construct a comprehensive and adequate social income security safety net.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We managed to do that in a way that did not impose a large burden on budgetary outlays. Our social security spending as a proportion of GDP, from memory, is a bit
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         over eight per cent. It is a relatively low proportion of GDP by the standards of most developed countries, particularly European countries. Yet we are able to reconcile that relatively low level of spending on a system which by and large was comparably effective, as a safeguard against poverty, to systems in other countries that consume a far higher proportion of GDP. How did we manage to achieve that? We placed an enormous emphasis on effective targeting of assistance. This is an area that consumed a huge amount of policy making time when we were in government. It is the way to reconcile an adequate social safety net with a relatively low level of taxation to GDP.

        What we avoided doing was a great deal of the so&amp;hyphen;called churning that goes on in many European countries, where payments are made to people on comparatively high income and then recouped by other means, principally through the tax system. I think that is a very important achievement. The end product of that was a social security system that was amongst the most efficient in the world, in two important respects. Firstly, as I said, it was efficient in terms of its targeting. A great bulk of the assistance did go to people who would otherwise face severe difficulties. Relatively small amounts were wasted on people who did not need that assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We were also an efficient system in another respect, and that was in a purely administrative sense. A group of academics based at the ANU did a comparative study of social security systems in different countries and they reached the conclusion that, of the group of 10 developed countries they studied, ours had the second lowest administrative costs as a proportion of outlays. I think the only one that was lower was Norway. The significance of that is that we were able to do that notwithstanding, as I said, having placed a great emphasis on targeting, which you would expect to impose some sort of administrative burden. So a good deal was achieved in that respect.

        In terms of the adequacy of the social safety net, whichever way you slice it, there were major improvements during our period of government. If you look at each of the
        <break page="5035" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         major payment categories and compare them to any of the generally utilised or accepted poverty lines, the Henderson one being the most commonly used one, the level of pensions, the level of allowances, the level of assistance targeted to low income families unambiguously improved, and in some cases it improved very substantially indeed. I instance the additional payments made to low income families with children, both inside and outside the work force. The real level of assistance increased, depending on the age of the child, by between 100 and 150 per cent. That is a very major achievement. The real rate of pension also improved unambiguously in real terms and against the poverty lines, and likewise allowances.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Most of these comparisons have tended to be done in this country in terms of the Henderson poverty line or some variation of the Henderson poverty line. It is important to bear in mind that that is a pretty tough hurdle to improve against because the Henderson poverty line is indexed to household disposable income per capita. That has meant that the real value of the Henderson poverty line has increased by about 20 per cent during our period of government. In the United States, by contrast, most measures of poverty tend to be based on a criterion that is indexed to prices rather than to household disposable income. Therefore, for us to have been able to improve things unambiguously against the Henderson benchmark I think is a pretty significant achievement.

        The other thing we sought to do, the other area we focused on particularly in the latter part of our period in government, was to minimise barriers to people receiving assistance participating in the work force. In doing that, we were not simply confining our attention to those on unemployment payments, we were also very concerned to maximise the opportunities and to minimise the barriers to participation in work by people on disability pensions, people on a sole parent pension, through programs like the disability reform program and the jobs education and training scheme, or JET scheme. We put a very great emphasis on improving that access.

         We restructured the whole scheme of assistance to people on unemployment payments in the context of the Working Nation statement where we redesigned the income test to try to eliminate a situation where people could end up, if they raised their earnings from private exertion, losing dollar for dollar in the form of a reduction in social security entitlements over very wide income ranges. That obviously was unacceptable and we redesigned the income test to address that.

         We also brought in other measures to avoid people being trapped in a state of dependency on social security payments. The introduction of the parenting allowance had, as a key part of its rationale, to eliminate cases where you might have a couple both unemployed with dependent children and one member of the couple might be offered a low paid full-time job. Under the pre-July 1995 income test structure you could easily have situations where people would go backwards financially as a result of one member of that partnership, or that couple, taking up a low paid full-time job. We introduced the parenting allowance as a means of overcoming that by increasing the income support to the low-income couple where one member of the couple was staying at home caring for children.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Other things we did included the introduction of employment and education entry payments to help people who might have the option of a job but who might be precluded from taking up a job offer because they could not buy suitable clothing or suitable work wear or whatever.

There were a whole raft of measures which we implemented over a

         We also placed considerable emphasis on compliance measures and when, in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, there was no doubt that the whole compliance regime and anti-fraud regime were somewhat slack, a good deal of effort was put into addressing that problem. Our system was reviewed in 1993 by an internationally recognised expert, Professor Weatherby of Harvard University, who concluded that the slackness which had existed had been largely corrected. To go too much further than we were proposing to do at the time, he said, would start to raise serious problems about unreasonable infringements of civil liberties and real questions about the cost effectiveness of further measures.

         While we were obviously gratified to know that we had been able to achieve a good deal in overcoming the relative slackness in the system that particularly emerged during the period of the previous government in that whole area of compliance and fraud control, we never for a minute suggested that that was the end of the process. What we did say was that the idea that there were huge spectacular further gains to be made from further compliance arrangements or anti&amp;hyphen;fraud measures was likely to be illusory. We worked over time with new measures. I think in every budget there would be a fairly exhaustive search for new effective compliance measures. The trick is to come up with genuine compliance measures and not bogus ones. The Finance Department used to put up some pretty significant hoops in that regard, but we did continue to maintain our efforts in that area.

          increase in assistance for the unemployed through labour market program assistance. However, at the same time we said that if we are going to have that very large boost in assistance to the unemployed we do think it is reasonable to introduce a tightened scheme of reciprocal obligations. In the context of that Working Nation exercise, within the government at the time, we had quite a debate about the appropriate level of tightness and the appropriate level of severity of penalties for people not complying with administrative or activity agreement requirements. There was significant tightening but that tightening was done in the context of a comprehensive package of further measures designed to assist the unemployed find work.

         The proposed new meaning of `unsuitable work' is an extreme one which puts the onus on job seekers to negotiate and overcome issues that may make a job unsuitable.

The onus will be on them to negotiate training for a job where they lack the qualifications, skills or experience necessary. Job seekers must provide medical evidence to prove that particular work is unsuitable because of an illness, disability or injury. The onus is on job seekers to consider self&amp;hyphen;employment or moving home to take up work. The new definition of `sufficient reason' to refuse a job offer is equally severe. The National Welfare Rights Network have identified a number of concerns about the existing penalties that operate.

The proposal to require completed employer contact certificates to be provided with an initial claim for unemployment payments is unreasonable.

The day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day care of a severely disabled person is difficult and stressful because it is unrelenting. The pressures of meeting the demands of the disabled impact heavily on the carer's privacy, employment opportunities and financial stability. Furthermore, continuous care is an emotional and physical drain on the carer that can create social isolation, depression and ill health.

        Disability also impacts heavily on a family unit. It has a negative effect on job mobility, promotion and their choice of house. A person with a disability also needs special equipment, increased medical assistance and special respite or child care. The figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirm that nearly half the principal carers of a child with a handicap felt the effects of reduced income or extra expenses because of their caring role.

They are not encouraged to maintain paid work, but are discouraged from employment by inadequate carer services and unresponsive, inflexible employers and workplaces. Furthermore, carers have their working lives suspended or terminated as a result of their caring responsibilities. The taxation system does not accommodate their costs or needs, and carers lack access to superannuation and to education and training programs.

        The changes announced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget will make life easier for carers. The government has delivered on its election commitment of income support arrangements for carers. These changes will increase flexibility for carers. The government will extend the hours—from 10 to 20 hours per week—that a carer may participate in paid or voluntary work, education or training, thus allowing carers the chance to develop, update or maintain their skills. This will enable a smoother transition for them when they are able to return to the work force.

        The availability of flexible respite care is vital to carers. However, often there is a reluctance for carers to use respite. The reasons range from a reluctance to leave their family members with a stranger; a limited availability and awareness of quality care; difficulty in recruiting and maintaining carer providers; financial concerns; bureaucratic obstacles and transportation problems. Carers must therefore be educated and given the opportunity and access to respite care, including crisis care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Out of the diverse range of formal support needed by carers, this is probably the most critical. Carers want and need respite as an ongoing regular alternative, so that they have an opportunity to have a decent quality of life. This bill will increase the respite period from 42 to 52 days a year, so that a carer can temporarily cease caring without their eligibility being affected. This allows carers to use respite care services and ease the pressure on their caring responsibilities.

        The proposal to introduce revised impairment tables for the disability support pension will tighten the assessment process. This will ensure that those customers whose impairment has only a relatively small impact on their overall ability to work do not qualify for the disability support pension, but instead receive a more appropriate income support. To qualify for the disability support pension, a claimant must have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of at least 20 per cent, as assessed under the impairment tables, and a continuing inability to work.

        The government's voluntary work initiative was an election commitment contained in both the government's social security policy statement, `A social security safety net', and the employment and policy training policy, `Pathways to a real job'. As a result, the government has put in place measures to increase the voluntary work participation for unemployed people 50 years of age and over. Currently, a person on jobsearch allowance aged 50 years and over is limited to 65 days full-time voluntary work a year.

Careful consideration will be given to matching volunteer needs to program goals.

This new combination of paid work and voluntary work builds on an existing exemption from the activity test of older unemployed in receipt of income support for 12 months or more who earn at least 35 per cent of the average weekly male earnings, which is currently $245 per week. For people undertaking full&amp;hyphen;time voluntary work, only 32 hours per week are required to satisfy the activity test. This differs from the 40 hours that are required for a combination of voluntary work and paid

        Since coming into office in March, I have had a number of inquiries about the changes to the widow allowance. These inquiries have come from women who have been left in a very vulnerable position. These women have lost the financial and emotional support of a partner and have no recent work force experience. As from 20 March 1997 the widow allowance will be extended to women aged at least 50 years who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age. This measure will help older women who were widowed before turning 50 but who have not been able to find work because they have limited work force experience. This legislation will provide common payment arrangements for those women. Payment arrangements for those women will also be simplified. This rationalisation of payment will improve government services to these women.

         —I understand people wanting to put a gloss on things which are unpalatable, but I do not think I have ever before heard the like of what I have just heard just now, that somehow savings of $1.2 billion made in this bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996, which is money taken off unemployed, off pensioners, off widows, off all kinds of beneficiaries, is somehow benefiting them. I will give some examples. Firstly, the provisions have been changed to allow more voluntary work and make it easier. I do not know whether the previous speaker, the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace), who was so laudatory of this measure, actually knows it, but that will save the government $7 million. There is a saving involved. So how come the people are better off?

        Secondly, there is the widows pension. Of course there were concerns from the women of Australia about the changes to widows' entitlements in terms of the whole nature of change of work and so on, but the changes being proposed in these amendments save $22 million. Who from? Widows. The widows are contributing $22 million towards the government revenues. That is terrific for them and I am sure they are delighted about it. In fact, what I am sure of is that they do not actually know it is happening, because this budget is so opaque and so obscure and so difficult to find out what is being proposed and the impact of those changes. I have never seen the like of it before. But people will eventually find out when it comes to them, and in that context it is worth while examining some of the proposed changes.

        The one that is in some ways the nastiest and the most vicious is the earnings credit scheme, where the pensioners of Australia are going to be paying $259 million to the government or getting that much less in support—and that is keeping the government's promise to the old people of Australia. If that is keeping their promise, I would hate to see it when they break one. I will quote
        <break page="5044" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         what was said in the second reading speech in this chamber with regard to the earnings credit scheme:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Due to its conceptual and procedural complexity, the earnings credit scheme is difficult to administer and is also difficult for social security recipients to understand. The limited understanding of the scheme by social security recipients puts in doubt its value as a significant incentive to take up casual work opportunities. Given this, as well as the relatively high cost involved, the government has decided to abolish the credit scheme in respect to both pensions and benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Doesn't that sound terrific? They are doing us all a favour. It is too hard to understand, people are not really using it and it is expensive to administer. What the minister did not say was that the savings are $259 million. There will be less pensions paid and benefits paid in the four years involved of a quarter of a billion dollars. That is what it is really about. Yet in the second reading speech, when he knows the public would not understand the details, when no figures are given, he pretends to make out that this is somehow beneficial. This is the scheme that was talked about as the Santa Claus scheme. I expect you recall that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The problem we had was that many retired people and people on benefits were getting casual work, it may be a week, it may be two weeks at a time, for instance, acting as a Santa Claus at Christmas time. Literally thousands of older people did that and they got paid this money, which meant they lost their pension for a week. So it was really a nasty problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The previous government said, `Okay, if you earn a certain amount a year, we should take the year into account, as we do for taxation.' In that way, someone could work as Santa Claus for a couple of weeks, earn a thousand dollars, and not lose any pension. The current government hates Santa Clauses, it hates Christmas, but most of all it hates pensioners, and that is who it is attacking.

        This is a vicious exercise. It is put forward as a benefit, but it is so complicated that no&amp;hyphen;one understands it.

        For many people, being employed for a week or two a year, or for a couple of days a week over time, is important. It gives them an outing. It involves them. It gives them an external application. That is all going to go. People will say, `Why bother if I am going to lose my pension for that week?' That will create more uncertainty, more confusion, and more insecurity. They will be told, `You did not declare your income, therefore you got a pension you should not have got.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That will happen because no&amp;hyphen;one is going to know about it and so they will be penalised. They will have to pay it back with interest. So the savings may well come from penalties rather than from actual loss of pension. This measure is indicative of this budget. It is a nasty, mean and vicious budget. The savings are illusory.

        Another nasty measure is the one for 16&amp;hyphen; to 18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds on jobsearch allowance. Back in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, 16&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds received the dole at full payment for their age group. That was changed to a jobsearch allowance at a partial payment of 50 per cent, non&amp;hyphen;means tested. The aim of that was to say, `Once you leave school, your parents' income, whilst it is important, is not the sole factor. You will get an allowance to help you look for work and the allowance is not means tested on your parents' income.' That has now been wiped out. The harshest test of all is being applied, namely, the Austudy test. That means that thousands of young Australians will no longer get help looking for work.

         —I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his interest and his question. He has a great interest in aviation, being a pilot and an aircraft owner. Yesterday I tabled in this House Justice Staunton's report of the inquiry into the

          relations between CAA and Seaview Air which was initiated after the death of nine people in a crash occurring with Seaview Air on 2 October 1994. It was a very serious report highlighting some very substantial failings in the manner in which the CAA operates its functions and indeed also of the way Seaview Air operated its functions prior to the crash. I am aware, as the honourable member has asked me, of a statement made by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Justice Fisher. He made a press statement yesterday in which he responded to the report that I tabled into the inquiry into relations between the CAA and Seaview Air. He says:

        Having read the report, I think anybody who has read the report would agree that that response by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is inappropriate and, indeed, quite absurd. The reason it is absurd is that Justice Staunton has highlighted throughout his report great errors of judgment and a lack of expertise and competence. Throughout the report there are endless examples of a lack of expertise and competence. I find the response by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority quite inappropriate and absurd, and it dismays me. I refer the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to the report. Justice Staunton says:

        If anybody has any doubts that it was a major failure of a lack of expertise on behalf of the CAA, those sorts of quotes and many others littered throughout that report would confirm that.

I will be urging Mr Keith to ensure that the recommendations made by Justice Staunton are taken up

        I also take this opportunity to urge the Chairman and members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to reconsider their position on the board, to enable us to appoint to that board people with relevant aviation expertise. This is a very serious issue. Anybody reading that report undertaken by Justice Staunton will realise the enormity of the problem that there is before those who wish to reform the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to build a proper safety regulator in Australia. That task is not a task for amateurs; it is a task for professionals. We need people who know the industry, who have a lifetime's worth of experience in the industry, in order to enact the reforms that are necessary and which are highlighted by Justice Staunton in his report.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question and, yes, I have seen those reports. The short answer to the question is yes. The government's proposed amendments represent a balance between the interests of all groups and industries with a stake in the native title legislation. At the same time as we recognise the particular interests of the Aboriginal people, it is in the interests of all Australians to provide greater certainty over land tenure and, therefore, investment, especially as we seek to turn around Australia's very serious current account deficit, something the previous government exacerbated rather than ever seriously tackling.

        The Minerals Council spokesman, Mr Barry Vellnagel, says that the amendments are sensible and practical. The Western Australian government has already indicated its willingness to cooperate on the basis of the amended legislation. Native title is now a part of Australia's common law, but the Native Title Act as currently formulated is unworkable, to the detriment of all. There have been over 400 claims made and progress towards determination in these cases has been glacial at best. That is in no&amp;hyphen;one's interest.

        In terms of interaction with the mining industry in particular, major problems include the emergence of multiple native title claimants to a single piece of land, the fact that the right to negotiate process can be triggered at the exploration stage as well as at subsequent stages, the triggering of the need for negotiation with claimants whenever a pre&amp;hyphen;1994
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         mining lease is renewed and the costs and uncertainties associated with unduly lengthy periods of negotiation and arbitration. The proposed amendments will enable exploration, for example, to be excluded from the right to negotiate.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Only a very small percentage of exploration leases ultimately result in the development of a mine. At present, companies are tied up in endless negotiation which, at the end of the day, will be of little or no benefit to Aboriginal people. The amendments will also provide for a mining project to be subjected to the right to negotiate process only once. Currently, there are a multitude of decision points in the administration of the mineral exploration and mining lease system which can activate the right to negotiate. The amendments allow for earlier intervention by the minister in exceptional cases, during the right to negotiate and prior to an arbitral decision.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to multiple claims it will no longer be possible for different persons to register applications on behalf of the same group over the same area, nor will individuals be able to make a claim except on behalf of a group. The registration test, which is a pre&amp;hyphen;condition to the right to negotiate, will be further tightened to reduce the possibility of multiple claims. There are situations at present where companies are negotiating with up to eight different groups of Aboriginal claimants in relation to the same piece of land. This is clearly unsatisfactory and counterproductive for companies and Aboriginal groups.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendments will also enable pre&amp;hyphen;1994 leases to be renewed without triggering the act and will shorten the time limits on negotiation and arbitration from six to four months. The use of indigenous land use agreements will also be encouraged. The amendments set up a statutory framework for representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies. In total, they are an appropriate response to the difficulties with the act, while we await the outcome of the Wik hearing and, in particular, its reference to the effect of pastoral lease holdings on native title. These amendments will produce a better outcome for all Australians.

Let there be no dispute whatsoever that a vote for

I tend to believe that it is the excise on petrol that the Labor Party would really be interested in.

        The old-fashioned Labor tax stick is increases in wholesale sales tax rates and increases in petrol excise. I will tell you what it never was, though, Mr Speaker: it was never the courage to deal with the R&amp;D syndicates. The Labor Party never had the courage to do that. The member for Hotham wants to bring back tax benefits for high income earners. Let there be no mistake about it: a vote for Labor in Lindsay is a vote for higher taxes on low income earners and tax breaks for the wealthy. That is the Labor stick on tax policy.

      <para>
       Mr Speaker, in order to establish the case for dissent from your ruling, I will go through the question that was asked by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). The question was asked:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Is the Prime Minister aware that the DEETYA leading indicator of employment for August released just a few minutes ago has declined for the fifth month in a row . . . that is for every single month since your government was elected. Given that this adds to the mounting body of evidence showing job opportunities crashing around your government's ears, why is there not one single mention of unemployment in the motions for policy debate at the Liberal Party's federal council later this month?
      </para>
      <para>
       As I go to that portion of the question to which the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) took exception, I think that in the light of your ruling there are only one or two elements of that question that you could conceivably take objection to. If you chose to do so, it would be possible under the standing orders; but you have been generally quite liberal with both sides of the House in the introductory preamble of material associated with questions.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only objection that could be reasonably taken would be to use of the expression `crashing under your government's policies'. That probably is an argumentative epithet which `falling under your government's policies' would probably have cured. In relation to the words `every single month since your government was elected', I suppose the level of emphasis that is related in the combination of the words `every single' might conceivably be used by you to bring about a justification that the notion involved a level of argument. But when you take the totality of this, this is just a straight up and down, simple argument on the issue of unemployment.

         —To persist with this high standard of parliamentary debate and appropriate behaviour in the chamber which we are constantly lectured on, we will continue to address this matter. The simple fact of the matter is that, apart from one of two words that you find in that particular question which Speakers in the past would normally have ruled out, what we have here in addition to that is a request about matters that were or were not on the agenda of the Liberal Party conference to be conducted later this month.

        It has always been the position in this House that, where a matter is related to the activities of a political party that influence the government, it has been possible for the Prime Minister to field questions on that. I can recollect many occasions in this chamber when former Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating were invited by the opposition to
        <break page="5054" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         address questions that were being raised at Labor Party conferences. In addressing questions being raised at Labor Party conferences, all they were doing administratively was handling the problems associated with activities in day-to-day government. So the questions went from what was related to the DEETYA leading index to the questions of motions for policy to debate at the Liberal Party federal conference later this month.

        Then he went on to ask: `Would the Prime Minister  instruct the general secretary of the Liberal Party to place the question of unemployment on the agenda?' I would have thought that was an entirely appropriate set of inquiries to make of the government of the day. If you cannot make inquiries about what is going on in their political processes in their decision making, you can make no inquiries at all. Despite the harassment of you by the member for O'Connor, in which I suspect he objected to the tone of the question being raised by the honourable member for Batman, the content of the question of the honourable member for Batman was entirely appropriate.

        Mr Speaker, if we are going to have a reasonable question time in this place, I would request that you ensure that questions which are reasonably based get up. You have taken a pretty liberal attitude from time to time on both sides of the House, and I do not denigrate you for it. I think you are probably correct. You have taken a pretty liberal attitude to the introduction of argument into the structure of a question. You have also taken a pretty liberal attitude to the length of questions associated with that, and I would not want to discourage you from that course either. But in this particular instance liberality was not required on your behalf. You are not required and the Speaker was not required to address either the length of the question or its argumentative content beyond the odd word or two.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was a question, bar the odd word here or there, that was completely in order. On every precedent that has applied thus far in this place to addressing the question of whether or not a matter was in order in relation to a question, that has been upheld. This is a very simple case. It is an open&amp;hyphen;and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         shut case. This is a case where an appropriate question has been asked of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is a question, no matter how much objection the other side of the House might take to it. They have been taking a great deal of objection to questions on unemployment for some substantial period of time, as well they might because they are embarrassed by it. Merely because they are embarrassed by it, however, is no reason to determine that a matter is out of order.

        They are embarrassed by these questions on unemployment because they know that there was nothing in their budget let alone their policies on these matters, which is why they keep a constant hubbub—interrupting members on this side of the House when we ask questions on unemployment—on that subject in particular. The Access Economics statement of going to 9.2 per cent unemployment by the end of this century, an extraordinary judgment made by them on the impact of this budget, is a matter of some embarrassment to them.

Job security means that families in this nation survive. You can do everything you want to with social security. You can do anything you like at the end of the day with taxation concessions to families or whatever, but at the end of the day a job means that a family survives. That is absolutely critical.

I ask you to review this information—which I accept the Acting Speaker gave to me in good faith; I do not question that—and particularly the last element of the Acting Speaker's answer, in the light of a letter of 20 September 1996 from the Secretary of the Joint House Department advising maintenance operations staff of the preparation of business plans, which I

         —by leave—The government has stated from the time of its election the profound commitment it has to the engagement of this country with the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. This is the region with which Australia's security and economic prospects are most immediately bound up. This is the region where Australia needs to succeed and where the government is determined to equip Australia to succeed. Therefore, my choice of destinations for my first overseas visits as Prime Minister was quite deliberate.

        I visited Indonesia from 16 to 18 September and Japan from 18 to 20 September. Before that, I attended the 27th South Pacific Forum in Majuro, capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, from 3 to 5 September. I would like at the outset of this statement to thank President Kabua and the people of the Marshall Islands, President Soeharto and the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Hashimoto, for their warm and generous welcome and hospitality.

        My aim on my visits to Indonesia and Japan was to reaffirm the great value that my government places on Australia's relationship with those two countries.

         Contrary to earlier claims by the previous government that regional leaders would not deal with a coalition government, the fact is that both the Indonesian and Japanese leaders made it emphatically clear that they wanted the closest possible relationship with Australia under a coalition government and that they wanted to work as closely as possible with me and the members of my new government.

         I was able in both Indonesia and Japan to outline the government's major economic reform program. This was particularly important, given the interest that both of those countries have in Australia becoming a more dynamic and competitive economic partner. There was strong interest in the economic policies of the government and our reform agenda received a very positive response from both government and business representatives. These reforms are essential if Australia is to draw the maximum benefit from our geographic location in the fastest growing region in the world. We cannot expect the fruits of this growth simply to fall into our laps.

         In Indonesia, I made it clear that, like every other country in the region, Australia brings its own history, culture and attitudes to the regional association. I raised this because there will inevitably be differences between us from time to time. Understanding and managing such differences are important if we are to pursue successfully the many key economic and strategic interests we have in common with our partners. This is a point President Soeharto himself made to me during our conversations.

         Our economic links, strong though they are, should be regarded as being only at the start of a period of dramatic expansion and opportunity for an enormous range of Australian enterprises. A decade ago, trade between us was worth less than $1 billion. In 1995&amp;hyphen;96 it was worth $4.2 billion and grew by 30 per cent compared with the year before.

For the government's part, I made clear our commitment to providing the right political and economic conditions for this to occur.

         In Japan, I had most useful discussions with Mr Hashimoto, the Prime Minister. The complementarity of our interests both bilaterally and regionally means that there is great scope for us to cooperate. This was reflected in the joint press conference which the Prime Minister and I held during our talks. At that conference, Mr Hashimoto reiterated Japan's position that Australia was an indispensable partner for it in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and confirmed Japan's support for Australia's participation in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Europe summit process.

         Our economic relationship with Japan remains crucial to Australia's prosperity and to Japan's growth as well. Australia trades more with Japan than with any other country. In 1995 a quarter of our merchandise exports and a fifth of our services exports went to Japan. From Japan's point of view, we are its fifth largest source of imports and its largest supplier of energy apart from oil.

         I reaffirmed the government's determination that Australia become an even more competitive and reliable supplier of commodities and resources. I also emphasised Australia's capability as an exporter of manufactures and services.

As a sign of the government's commitment, I pointed to the role of the newly established prime ministerial Supermarket to Asia Council.

There is a strong coincidence of views between Australia and Japan on regional issues, and this was reflected in my discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto.

         Earlier in September I attended the South Pacific Forum. Australia has important interests and responsibilities in the South Pacific. The region looks to us to provide support and encouragement as it deals with some very serious problems. It looks to us to exercise a positive leadership role. My aim in attending the forum was to reassure the region, and those outside the region who see Australia as having a particular part to play, that my government was committed to a supportive role.

         At the forum I reaffirmed this commitment, and this was warmly welcomed by the other heads of government.

         I did not go to the forum with prescriptions in hand. I went to listen to the opinions of the heads of governments in the region and to discuss how Australia might help them tackle their problems. I was impressed by the recognition of the problems facing the island states

          as they adjusted to a world that is moving towards an era of lower levels of protection and tariffs.

         Concessional access arrangements such as the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement are of declining relevance to island states as Australia's economy has become more open and internationally competitive. It was accepted that fiddling with the local content provisions under the agreement would not be useful. I also found general agreement that relatively high levels of aid had not brought about the desired increases in economic growth and living and social standards.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Against this background, at their private retreat the heads of government reached some important conclusions and made some important decisions. Most notable was acceptance of the need to continue with economic reform. Of course, each island state has its own character and particular set of problems. Any effective strategy—and Australian support—will need to take this into account. But, even amongst the smallest states which face particular problems of long&amp;hyphen;term economic viability, there was recognition that the private sector and improved competitiveness were central to growth and higher employment levels. It was also accepted that aid would not produce results unless associated with internal economic reforms. Indeed, the meeting agreed that aid should focus on supporting economic reform.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The heads of government agreed on a number of practical measures to support these common aims. Regular meetings of forum economic ministers will be held—the first to be hosted by Australia next year before the next forum meeting in the Cook Islands. At the next meeting, ministers will consider how to maintain the momentum of tariff reform in order to liberalise trade and increase competitiveness without compromising other national policy objectives. Ministers will report to the next forum on progress in developing and publishing national investment policy statements and bringing these into line with APEC principles by the end of 1998.

          development of the private sector and reduce public sector costs. In other areas, the forum agreed on further steps towards improving the management of the region's fisheries and forestry resources. Australia joined the consensus in inviting France to rejoin the post&amp;hyphen;forum dialogue, following on France's decision to stop testing and its cooperation in developing the comprehensive test ban treaty. The forum provided me with the opportunity to have some useful separate bilateral meetings with President Kabua and the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, and informal bilateral discussions with many other heads of government.

In his travels in all the countries he visited, he was the beneficiary of the extraordinarily effective foreign policies pursued by us when we were in government. He has some substantial problems with his foreign policy. His visit exacerbated some of them, and most of them he did not address.

        Unfortunately for this country, in both the direction of our foreign policy and the interplay of domestic and foreign issues, we are now experiencing a confusion in the region which arises from the mixed messages being sent about this government's understanding of its relationship with the region, where our priorities lie and an inability to provide coordinated responses to concerns in both bilateral relationships with individual countries and our approaches to multilateral diplomacy.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         Indeed, it was extraordinary to see during the Prime Minister's visits that, at the same time he was trying to tell the region in a sporadic sort of way that we sustained our interest in the area, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) was in Europe saying that we are not forgetting Europe and Europe was assuming a new priority—an extraordinarily ill&amp;hyphen;timed gesture on his part. We have seen similar timing in positions being adopted by the foreign minister in relation to the bilateral relationship with China and positions being taken at exact variance by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) indeed while he is there.

         We have seen in recent times in the region, because it takes a while for these issues to build up, in a number of important newspapers, some of which reflect government views and some of which do not, their editorialising which casts great doubt on where they think the sympathies of this Prime Minister lie in relation to issues which concern them in Australian domestic politics and what that manifests and reflects in what might be attitudes to the region.

         It is difficult, after the sort of record we had in office, for a prime ministerial visit to fail. The relationship we have with Japan is an extraordinary one. It is very deep. It goes to the ministerial level; it goes to ministerial council levels; it goes to an extraordinarily close connection between our various bureaucracies on a whole range of economic issues and growing even in the security area. It is almost impossible these days, with such affectionate regard in which this country is held in Japan, for even a benighted Prime Minister to cause them concern.

         Therefore it is not surprising that he received their polite reception, even in what must have been some mystification on their part by his assertions that somehow or other there was an economic problem in Australia that needed to be addressed and this would improve relations with them. The Japanese have had no problems at all in dealing with us and have had no problems with the structure and direction of the Australian economy over the 13 years that we have been in office. Therefore, there was no particular problem to

         Indonesia is a somewhat different matter. What this visit saw was that extraordinary interplay that I referred to earlier of the Prime Minister's concerns domestically and the messages that he wished to send to that region. One of those areas has caused some mystification to the Indonesians, and that mystification will grow. Again, the government in Indonesia were anxious to ensure that he had a good visit. They were anxious to ensure, were he to stand up and express a view on where the direction of the relationship was going to go, that he had a forum in which to express that and they would receive him politely no matter what he said.

         Nevertheless, his interventions were extraordinary. For example, my staffers counted that on no less than 16 occasions in three speeches the Prime Minister expressed the view that Australians were not Asians. He erected a straw man, of course, to do that. No Australian Prime Minister and no Australian foreign minister has gone into the region saying anything as silly as that statement—that Australians were Asians.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We were always concerned to express our view of the relationship with the region in purely geographic and economic terms, never in cultural and social terms. We tended to say that Australia was part, for example, of the Asia-Pacific region—a demonstrably correct geographic enunciation of what our situation is, and that is what we used to do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So frequently repeated was the Prime Minister's mantra that Australians are not Asians that, after a period, his hosts must have wondered, `What exactly is he trying to say? What is he trying to tell us by this constant iteration of this statement?'—a statement which they had never heard before from any Australian minister. It is no wonder therefore that, when they have to contemplate what is going on inside Australian domestic politics from time to time, a question mark is placed over what the Prime Minister's commitments are and what his interests are.

          They would have been further mystified by the statement the Prime Minister made that we were not a bridge to Asia—an extraordi nary statement inserted in his speeches at his own behest, as far as we can tell, and not something that he was advised to do by anybody else. The notion that we are in any shape or form a bridge to Asia socially or culturally has never been presented anywhere in Asia. The notion that we happen to be in some way or other a cultural or social bridge to Asia has never formed part of the rhetoric of any Australian I know visiting the region, not just at a ministerial level but anybody else. They are used to rhetoric from us on the notion of Australia being a bridge to Asia; we have constantly made statements in that regard in the economic context. That is the only context in which that has been presented in the region around us—the economic context.

         For a Prime Minister to stand up and say that Australia is not a bridge to Asia can be interpreted in only one way. Not being used to discourse that goes to some notion or other that there is a straw man down there in Australia to be knocked over because somebody out there is supposed to have said at some point in time that socially or culturally we are a bridge to Asia, and not being privy to the mystifying elements of the Prime Minister's mind, the people in the region, those listening to the Prime Minister—polite though they always are—put another question mark over the Prime Minister, the direction in which he was taking foreign policy and what he really meant.

They know very well, too, that we are frequently arguing with European companies and others that it is wise for them to set up in Australia, because in Australia you are more or less in the same time zone as the region around us and you can do effective business in the area.

Do not think for one minute that over time the interplay of matters, which after weeks he decided to address here and in such a gratuitous fashion in parliament the other day, will not play into the region and do not think for one minute the confusion will not play into the region. For example, we now have a problem in our relationship with China. We have a problem that has developed since the Prime Minister has come into office. No government could help some of the elements of that. Other elements, however, have been exacerbated by the inadequacies of this government. They arise from two things.

         One of those that has been discussed frequently in this place is the dishonouring of honourably undertaken agreements related to the DIFF program. A second has been an extraordinarily foolish interpretation placed on our relationship with the United States, which has reverberated back into China in a way that gives China offence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me go into this in some detail in the short time available to me. Firstly, we arrived at a very good set of understandings with the United States when the United States officials were here recently. But what were they on? They were on matters specifically raised, dealt with and put in place by the previous Labor government—the arrangements associated with Pine Gap and offered to the United States on training establishments. Minister Ray was working on both of those.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A normal continuation of the Australian relationship with the United States was put into a completely different context, totally unnecessarily, to the concern of some countries in the region. Why? Because, ill&amp;hyphen;advisedly, the defence minister and one or two others went out there and tried publicly to get the United States to sign up to positions that they would not. They were not prepared to consider at that time the basing of United States forces in Australia. What did that mean?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the government backed off and put that interpretation in, they activated something that the United States was most anxious not to do. Firstly, the United States does not want an impression in the region that they are looking
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          forward to alternative military arrangements to those which they currently enjoy with Japan. They precisely did not want to send a signal into the region that somehow or other the United States and Australia were organising a new containment strategy on China.

         So you now have a number of issues running which worry the Chinese, which the Americans would have advised you would worry the Chinese, and which is why the Americans play along with the person prepared to be friendly to them. Nevertheless, it was specifically an interpretation that the Americans did not want on their relationship with us, and was unnecessary, but necessarily it was made the focus of government attention because they so manifestly flubbed their original approach.

         I cite that as an example of a problem that the Prime Minister must fix: mixed messages being sent to the Chinese, mixed messages being sent to the Asian region overall. No more ample evidence of that could be provided than what you have seen in response in the region around us to the Prime Minister's blithe passing imprimatur of open discussion on people in this country who have been making overtly and openly unsuitable statements in terms of the relevance of the right of various people of Asian descent to be in this nation.

The Howard government has the hide to create the problem, the lack of opportunity, by cutting university places and funding out of the University of Western Sydney and then front up and say that they have the therapy treatment. The loss of labour market programs hurts young people in western Sydney, along with training program cuts, university funding cuts, public sector sackings, loss of the investment for the great infrastructure program throughout western Sydney, the orbital road for the region.

         What is the reality? The reality is that the University of Western Sydney is losing 1,000 places as a result of Senator Vanstone's cuts. The former Labor government had in place a 15 per cent growth program that has now become a 15 per cent cut: 1,000 places lost. This is a government which is ripping the heart out of the great inspiration, the great equalising institution in western Sydney—our university.

He was the person who thought it was equitable that art students and students in education should pay 25 per cent of their course costs in HECS while medical students with much better prospects of higher incomes should pay only 13 per cent of their course costs.

        At the last federal election the electors of Lindsay certainly made their view known.

He may have been absolutely hopeless in education; he may have contributed absolutely nothing. He may have used the lounge in his office upstairs as a bed, snoring away during the day, because he contributed nothing to policy. But there was one thing he liked: the perks of office. So he decided to say, `There are technical reasons why the result in this election should be

         —Factual errors. Let us look at what the government's decisions on universities actually mean for Australian universities. The effect of the government's decisions will be these: over the next three to four years we confidently expect that the number of students in higher education will increase; and we believe that the universities of Australia will be better off because we have provided access to universities for Australian students who were denied access by the previous government.

        It was all right for overseas students to come in and occupy positions in tutorials in the classroom. But it was not all right for Australian students to gain access to Australian universities on the same basis as the overseas students. The government has asked the universities to more efficiently manage their resources. The previous government established the Hoare review of university management because they were aware of efficiency problems in university administration. That is why the Hoare review was established. The present government said, `We have seen the results of the Hoare review and we believe that there is room for efficiency within the universities.' I do not think that
        <break page="5076" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Next year the government has asked the universities to take a one per cent efficiency cut in operating grants. No-one would think that that is a huge cut and the universities are surely able to cope with that. Because of the increases in research funding, Australian universities will receive some $51 million more in operating grants next year than they received this year. Over the next four years the efficiency cuts total some $689 million out of a total expenditure of $20 billion. That is an efficiency cut across the four years of four per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Along with those decisions, the government has given the universities the flexibility to manage their affairs in a way that the failed system of central planning that the previous government put in place denied them. As a consequence of the government's decision, there will actually be an increase next year in the total number of undergraduate places in universities of some 6,000. In 1998, there is likely to be another increase of 6,000 in the total undergraduate places in universities.

        We have also given the universities the right to enrol additional undergraduates above target on a HECS only basis.

They will be able to fund additional places for their universities.

He then went on to denigrate the contribution of Ross Free, the former member for Lindsay, to higher education. I have said in this House before, but let me repeat it, that a group of western suburbs federal members got together and started pushing for a University of Western Sydney. The chairman of that group of western suburbs members was Ross Free, the former member for Lindsay, and I was the secretary of that group.

        There were a lot of twists and turns in that fight but, at the end of the day, we overcame considerable resistance and achieved the establishment of Chifley University, as it was then called—regrettably, the incoming Liberal state government changed that name—on behalf of the people of western Sydney. Why? Because we felt that ordinary people ought to have the right for their children, if they had the desire and if they had the motivation, to aspire to undertake a university course. We have always believed that people in western Sydney and particularly our young people are every bit as good as people from everywhere else. That is why Ross Free was chairman of that committee that fought for the University of Western Sydney.

They do not belong in the universities of this country because they are not wealthy, they are not rich and they are not intelligent. Of course I find these remarks offensive.

        I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House do not subscribe to that view of universities at all. After all, over the 13 years of our government, we increased the number of students going to universities from 350,000 to 630,000—a huge increase. In my electorate and in the electorate of Lindsay, you saw a lot of working-class families that you think non-rich and unintelligent having a son or a daughter going to a university for the first time, and more often than not it was the University of Western Sydney.

Its operating grants will increase in 1997 by 1.8 per cent over this year; in 1998 it will increase by 0.6 per cent over this year. This is an increase. This is an increase that even Labor and Ross Free must be able to understand. If it goes up by 1.8 per cent, it is an increase. If it goes up by 0.6 per cent, it is an increase, not a decrease.

        The greater flexibility in funding arrangements will provide greater opportunities in many ways. First of all, by allowing full fee paying places in addition to HECS places, we will be creating fairness, the same opportunities, for Australian students as have previously been created for overseas students. This is fair, this is equitable, in great contrast to the policies of the other side.

         Thirdly, there will be continued support for the Australian International Education Foundation which will be encouraging the growth in exports of education services from Australia. We will be matching dollar for dollar the contribution of universities in this area. This is an area that is expected to grow in revenue for Australia from its $1.5 billion just three years ago to an estimated $3 billion by the year 2000.

         Let us look at the facts about equity in education, particularly on the revenue side and the HECS fees. Despite all the empty rhetoric from the other side, when it comes to the crunch they cannot deliver. They want to protect the high income earners. Only 15 per cent of current taxpayers have ever been to university, 85 per cent of taxpayers have not benefited from a tertiary education and 85 per cent of current taxpayers will not have access to the higher income earning potential that tertiary education provides, yet they are still paying for it. Some 70 per cent of school leavers still won't get to university, yet the other side would have that 70 per cent that do not get a university education subsidising the 30 per cent that do. Surely fairness and equity demand that those who benefit most ought to pay more and ought to contribute more to the benefits that they get. Obviously, the other side does not believe in fairness.

The other side seems to very conveniently overlook the fact that tertiary education is not the only source of training for vocational education and career opportunities. This government has significantly increased spending in many of these areas in the current budget and in the forward estimates. For instance, over the next four years there will be $23 million worth of training for teachers of vocational education. There will be further funding for increased professional development of secondary teachers involving vocational education and training. There will be $20 million in each of the next four years to support vocational education and training courses in schools. There will be $6 million over the next two years for job pathways

In five years Commonwealth debt grew from $23 billion to $97 billion and foreign debt from $23 billion to $180 billion, a growth of 700 per cent in the reign of Labor—a current account deficit record the worst in the Western world, the industrialised world, with almost the highest real interest rates in the Western world and the highest unemployment since the Great Depression. They want to lecture us about unemployment, when they had over one million unemployed in `the recession we had to have'. How callous can you get—over one million people out of work without even counting the hidden unemployed?

From 1 July 1995, wife pension and mature age partner allowance were phased out. However, those people who had claimed these payments and were qualified for them before that date were `saved' from the effect of the changes. The savings provision did not operate as intended for the mature age partner allowance. For example, when a disability pensioner turns 65 years of age and is automatically transferred to age pension, it was intended that his wife pension partner continue to qualify for wife pension. The Social Security Act did not allow, however, for `saved' mature age partner allowance recipients to continue to receive the mature age partner allowance when their mature age allowance partners are automatically transferred to age pension. This bill makes amendments to rectify this situation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill also makes amendments to continue the effect of savings provisions in clause 54 of schedule 1A. Clause 54 provides a series of savings provisions which applied to maintain the status quo of various groups of family allowance recipients who were overseas when the family payment regime commenced operation on 1 January 1993. If not for these savings provisions, these people, who formerly received an add&amp;hyphen;on for dependent children as a component of their pension, would not have been qualified for the new family payment.

        Under the Social Security Act, a person's assets may affect payment of their social security pension, benefit or allowance.

        Finally, the bill amends the Social Security Act to rectify a technical problem with a provision in pension rate calculator A. When the Social Security Act was amended in 1992 to integrate family allowance and family allowance supplement into a new payment—family payment—some inappropriate consequential amendments were made to a provision dealing with how a person's reduction for ordinary income is to be worked out in the situation of a person who is a member of a couple and has a partner receiving a social security or service pension. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.

        This bill provides for a number of changes to the patient contribution Australians will pay for their medicines when accessing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The PBS has provided Australians with protection against the high cost of necessary pharmaceutical drugs for over 40 years, and it is the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         government's intention that this scheme will continue to provide that protection for all Australians. The PBS is without doubt a world leader in providing these drugs at a reasonable cost both to the taxpayer and to the patient.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Regrettably, with the escalating costs of new medicines, it has now become necessary to ask people to contribute a little more towards the cost of their medication. To this end the government has decided, reluctantly I might add, to raise the patient charges for all persons accessing the scheme. Concessional users, the most frequent users of the scheme, will be asked to pay an additional 50c per prescription, a rise of contribution from the present $2.70, while the general users will pay a maximum of $20 towards their own medication, representing a rise of $2.60 per prescription.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to note that the `safety net' arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this scheme. The annual concessional limit to access the safety net will remain as 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40, and the general safety net limit is to remain unchanged at $600, with a normal CPI indexation being due on 1 January 1997. Members will note that many general users of the scheme will now reach the safety net limit quicker, using fewer prescriptions. It is important to note that this program continues the government's policy of protecting families since the safety net also covers the patient's family. By keeping the safety net constant at $600, anyone with a chronic illness will be protected and will not be asked to pay more; they will simply, in the course of any 12 months, reach the safety net faster.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The pharmaceutical allowance for pensioners will remain at $140.40 per year and will continue to be indexed, which is sufficient to cover their co&amp;hyphen;payments for 44 prescriptions. As the average user in this group has about 30 prescriptions per year the allowance will continue to over&amp;hyphen;compensate most pensioners. If a pensioner reaches the safety net the additional annual maximum cost is $26 a year. This is little more than the average price of
        <break page="5083" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         one of the 52 prescriptions needed to reach the safety net.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It must be said that the government has maintained the very high level of protection afforded these persons by only increasing the patient contribution by 50c and maintaining the `safety net' protection. The rise to date in the concessional co&amp;hyphen;payment represents an increase of only one per cent per annum while the cost of the PBS has risen by 16.5 per cent in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 alone.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opportunity has been taken to amend the indexation of these charges to bring all indexation under the scheme to 1 January of each year commencing on 1 January 1998. Members will note that the increases in co&amp;hyphen;payments in the bill are to take effect on 1 January 1997 and that the indexation of the patient charges will not take place until the next year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The method of indexing of the general safety net threshold and all patient charges is to be amended to allow the calculated figures to be rounded to the nearest 10c, that is, either up or down, not just down, as was the previous arrangement. It has been of concern for some time that the previous rounding process worked against the interests of the taxpayer and these changes are considered to be a fairer method of sharing the rises in charges driven by CPI increases.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The final item in this bill concerns a matter of interest to all Australians, for the government feels it is time to make it clear that this program is for Australian residents and not to be accessed by people who might be merely visiting Australia. I hasten to add that visitors from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement are to continue to receive the benefits as they are entitled to under those agreements. But it has been of concern for some time that persons visiting Australia have taken advantage of the PBS, and thus the Australian taxpayer, while here, and in some cases even after they have left our shores, to have their pharmaceutical needs subsidised by the Australian taxpayer.

         It has not been uncommon to hear reports of drugs being found by Australia Post or the Customs Service in the process of being sent overseas to people who clearly are not resi dents of Australia. These amendments change the National Health Act 1953 so that the PBS may only be accessed by people eligible for Medicare benefits. These are Australian residents, eligible overseas representatives and other persons treated under the Health Insurance Act 1973 as being eligible persons, including visitors from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.

        Before supplying a pharmaceutical benefit the pharmacist will need to be satisfied that the patient is eligible for Medicare benefits.

        The act continues to provide for refunds of excess moneys spent on pharmaceutical benefits where the patient is unable to satisfy the pharmacist that they are eligible but are later able to satisfy the secretary to the department as to their eligibility. The refunds by the government will be limited to the difference between what the patient should have paid and the Commonwealth dispensed price. These changes are estimated to reduce outlays on the PBS by $74.2 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and by $534.5 million over the following three years.

        Today I am introducing a package of measures comprising three bills, Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996, Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996, that give effect to the government's pre&amp;hyphen;election announcement in Meeting Our Commitments in which it announced that increased cost recovery for the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, would be pursued by this government.

        Bankruptcy administration has traditionally comprised three main areas, namely, court registry functions, estate administration functions, and trustee supervision and law enforcement type functions. The Bankruptcy Act 1966 provides for statutory office holders and private citizens registered under the act to perform these functions and, to some extent, the various functions overlap.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, in practice, is the administrative head of ITSA. The principal functions of the office are to oversee bankruptcy administration, to prepare a report to the minister about the operation of the Act, to manage the Common Investment Fund in which all moneys held by the statutory corporation called the Official Trustee are invested, and to review various decisions of trustees relating to matters such as income contributions and discharge from bankruptcy. The Inspector-General, as delegate of the minister, also authorises Commonwealth

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The majority of the statutory functions performed by the Inspector-General fall into the category of supervisory and law enforcement type functions. As administrative head of ITSA, the Inspector-General is the supervisor, under the Public Service Act 1922, of all the official receivers and their staff. With the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General will take over from the Federal Court of Australia most remaining administrative functions in connection with personal insolvency.

       <para first-indent="16">
        ITSA delivers a number of public interest services which support the personal insolvency system, including the development of policy advice, information and education to debtors and the commercial community, particularly financial counsellors and practitioners, the exercise of statutory Official Receiver powers to assist all bankruptcy trustees, and regulatory and law enforcement responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to these functions, the Official Trustee, through ITSA, administers approximately 92 per cent of all bankrupt estates. In many of these there are few, if any, assets so ITSA is unable to recover fees in respect of about 80 per cent of estates. ITSA performs an important public interest function in administering these non-fee paying estates on behalf of creditors. Without proper administration of all bankruptcies the credibility of the personal insolvency system would be jeopardised. Our credit system is reliant upon a credible personal insolvency system.

        The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy is administered by ITSA or by registered trustees, on a more equal footing in terms of contributing to the cost of the bankruptcy administration system.

        The legislation that I am introducing today will also produce a simpler collection method for fees and charges that are taken. It will streamline practices for both ITSA and registered trustees and reduce the paperwork burden within the system. For example, registered trustees will no longer be required to open a separate bank account for each estate, or to issue receipts in respect of each payment into estates.

        The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 provides for Australia's international education and training providers to contribute to the costs of regulation of the industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Extensive national industry consultations earlier this year indicated universal support for the continuation of current industry regulation arrangements. These arrangements are based on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS act. This act provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to international students studying in Australia. It does so by registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ESOS Act was introduced in 1991 to meet three main objectives, namely:

       <break page="5088" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16" left-indent="16">

        <para first-indent="16" left-indent="16">
         to ensure that taxpayers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These objectives remain relevant. This is not just the government's view, but the universal view of industry representatives expressed in recent national consultations by an independent consultant.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is an industry which currently earns Australia $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. The existing regulation of the industry adds value in the marketplace, with consumers willing to pay a premium for the assurances the regulation provides.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Properly promoted, such regulation can give Australian providers a marketing advantage over other international competitors. This advantage is recognised by the Australian providers in the recent review of the ESOS Act, particularly maintenance of the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are costs to the Commonwealth in maintaining this register. The Australian government has maintained the CRICOS and related monitoring activities at no charge to the industry since the introduction of the ESOS Act in 1991. The current bill provides for a provider registration charge which will recoup some of the future costs of maintaining CRICOS and the associated industry regulation and monitoring.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current bill proposes a sliding scale of annual provider registration charges based on the numbers of overseas students enrolled in the previous year. The charges range from $300 for providers with up to 10 enrolments in five steps to $5,000 for providers with over 400 enrolments in the previous year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

          remaining in the registration year. All these charges will be indexed against the all groups consumer price index. In total about $1 million annually is expected to be raised by this bill.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current bill is complementary to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which establishes administrative arrangements for management of the provider registration charge within the existing ESOS Act. These administrative arrangements include a requirement for payment of the annual charge by the end of February each year and provisions for a charge to reinstate suspended providers on CRICOS and for a late payment penalty. The administrative arrangements also impose an obligation on providers to keep enrolment records and to produce them to the secretary upon a written request.

         The international education and training industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of our growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade and diplomatic links, in addition to the $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. This industry deserves continuing protection. This bill enables such protection to continue. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

It will also generate additional income for the universities and will provide an extra incentive for diversity among institutions.

         The overwhelming majority of students will continue to contribute to the costs of their education through HECS alone. The government will not allow institutions to substitute fee paying places for HECS only places, nor will they be able to move whole undergraduate courses onto a fee paying basis. The number of fee paying places available to Australian undergraduate students will be limited to 25 per cent of domestic under graduate students in any course. If an institution offers fee paying places while at the same time failing to fill its undergraduate target with HECS liable students, a financial penalty of $9,000 will apply for each place.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Under current funding arrangements, if universities enrol more than the target number of Australian students, they receive no extra funding even though the Commonwealth receives HECS payments from the students. The government is removing this anomaly. From 1998, universities will be paid the equivalent of the minimum up&amp;hyphen;front HECS payment for each HECS liable undergraduate student enrolled above the target level. This provides some recognition of the costs incurred by institutions which over&amp;hyphen;enrol. It will also present an opportunity for institutions with low marginal costs to offer additional places to undergraduate students without charging fees.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill introduces differential HECS contributions from 1997. This measure strikes a better balance between the public and private funding of higher education. Students will now be required to make a contribution to the cost of their education which is more closely linked to both the actual cost of the course undertaken and the likely future benefits to the individual in terms of increased lifetime earnings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill provides that the new HECS charges will apply in three bands: $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. Each unit of study will be allocated to one of the bands. A student commencing a course in 1997 will have their HECS debt calculated according to the distribution of their units between each of the three bands. The student will be charged at the appropriate band amount for each unit rather than being charged at the same band for all units.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In introducing the new differential HECS arrangements, the amendments ensure that no existing student will have an unanticipated increase in the cost of their current course. The government will not be increasing the HECS charge or debt levels for existing debtors or for HECS liable students in their current courses. The new charges will only apply to students commencing a new course

        Consistent with this measure, the bill also enables the Open Learning Agency of Australia to set its fees at a level it considers appropriate. At present, the agency is constrained by its agreement with the Commonwealth to charge for undergraduate units at a fixed price. If this constraint is not lifted, the agency will be required to charge at a level that is below the new differential HECS level and lower than the level of fees institutions may charge. Eligible open learning students will continue to be able to defer their charge under the open learning deferred payment scheme. The amount the Commonwealth will lend to the student under the scheme will remain at the level of the current basic charge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also provides new HECS repayment thresholds, which will mean that individual HECS debtors repay their debt more quickly. The provisions retain seven repayment levels, but set them at lower levels. No student will be required to make HECS repayments until their income reaches the minimum threshold set out in the bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The lowering of the minimum threshold to $20,701 means that the current discount for voluntary payment at this income level will be discontinued. The repayment required at this income level will be less than $12 per week. The existing discounts of 25 per cent for up&amp;hyphen;front payments and 15 per cent for voluntary payments of $500 at any time will remain.

        A new section 20A of the act will clarify that advances of operating grants may be made for a broad range of purposes consistent with ministerial guidelines. Those guidelines will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and enable advances to be made for redundancy expenses and to assist institutions with the costs associated with restructuring. This amendment is required to clarify an ambiguity with the provisions contained in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996.

         The bill also includes a consequential amendment to the act of the Australian Maritime Council to enable it to charge undergraduate fees on the same basis as other higher education institutions. This bill reflects the government's commitment to a relevant, high quality education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

         Just very briefly, for the convenience of members, the matter has been before the Main Committee. It has been referred by one member back to the chamber. The situation is, therefore, that under the standing orders further consideration of this bill needs to be in the chamber. This motion simply facilitates that. The government obviously preferred the matter to be in the Main Committee, but that is now not to be the case. We are disappointed that that agreement was not able to be met. That being the situation, we have therefore provided for it and we would hope that the debate can now ensue here and, without too many interruptions, a fair bit of the second reading debate can be concluded.

         —Over the past few weeks I have listened intently to both government and opposition members expressing their views on the coalition's first budget in 14 years. There has been much discussion on the detail, the facts and the figures. The Labor opposition have tried to
         <break page="5094" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          highlight areas where funding may have been reduced and the so&amp;hyphen;called effects these changes may have had on certain sections of the Australian community. They have tried to bog down this debate, using sensationalism and scare tactics in an attempt to salvage some political mileage from Peter Costello's budget.

        The Labor Party have failed to understand why they are in opposition, why the Australian people rejected them in March and why Australia will keep rejecting them. The people watched in horror as the previous Labor government led Australia down the path of ruin. Labor had us on a path of debt and deficit into the next century. Australian parents knew that Labor was mortgaging their children's future. They watched unemployment reach the highest levels since the Depression and interest rates soar to record highs under the Keating engineered `recession we had to have'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        After 13 years of economic mismanagement of this great country, the mainstream Australian community has again taken control of its own destiny. No longer will Australians be dictated to by unions, by minority fringe groups and by vocal lobby groups. Finally, the silent majority is no longer silent, no longer prepared to sit back and watch Labor allow our great country to be devalued.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under Labor, family values, Christian values, the Australian way of life and a fair go for everyone appear to have meant nothing. There was no incentive to have a go, to roll up your sleeves and get stuck into it. `Why bother?' seems to have been the catch&amp;hyphen;cry. It just wasn't worth it. Those who did try were soon beaten back by rising interest rates and government regulations.

         Small business is the backbone of the Australian economy, but what did the Labor government do to help small business? Nothing. It only wanted to help its union mates. The unfair dismissal law introduced by Labor has destroyed the job opportunities of thousands of Australia's people. Constantly, small business people say to me that as soon as the changes to the Industrial Relations Act are implemented they will employ more staff—staff they desperately need but are not pre pared to employ under Labor's draconian, unfair dismissal legislation.

        I have listened with dismay to the rantings and ravings of honourable members opposite about the rationalisation of many of the unemployment training schemes. These schemes were a cruel hoax on the most disadvantaged in our society, the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed—a cruel hoax because these people were recycled through these schemes not to make them job ready but for blatant political reasons: to reduce the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed numbers before the last election. Labor did not care for these people. There were no jobs for them. Labor had destroyed so many small businesses that these people simply went on from one scheme to the next, each time raising their hopes and dreams and having them dashed against the rocks in a cruel game of statistics.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No longer can Labor hide behind these schemes or play around with magical figures. Australians no longer trust or believe in Labor. They are a party of the past with no vision for the future, only wishing to return to the days of the past. Australians simply do not want more of the past; they want a future for themselves and their children, a future that is bright and prosperous, a future with hope for all of us. It has often been said—and how true it is—that if every small business in Australia could employ just one more person Australia would have no unemployment problem.

        The budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) addresses the concerns of mainstream Australia. It was a firm but fair budget, a financially responsible budget that addressed the serious economic situation left to us by Labor. The Labor government left us with a $10.3 billion deficit, a monument to their years of economic mismanagement and deceit.
       </para>

        The new government and the Australian people were told by Labor that the budget was in an underlying balanced position. How far from the truth was that!

       <para first-indent="16">
        Under Labor this was becoming more and more difficult. As times have got harder, it has become more difficult to make ends meet. There are more families where both parents work, some by choice, but many who are forced to just pay the bills. There are more single parent families, more families at risk of breaking down.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition government has recognised the importance of families to our society, recognised that they need help and support. As promised by the coalition, the family tax initiative will provide significant tax relief for the low and middle income families who need it most.

       <para first-indent="16">
        An eligible parent will receive a $1,000 increase in the income tax free threshold for each dependent child. A one income family with two children, one of whom is under five, will benefit to the tune of $34 per fortnight. You do not have to be an accountant or a Rhodes scholar to figure out what a benefit that will be to families. I am sure the families of Lindsay certainly know and appreciate the benefits from the coalition government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Low income families, the people who need the most support and assistance and the people who have been forgotten by Labor, are not forgotten by the coalition government. Low income families will be able to access equivalent fortnightly cash assistance.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the greatest benefits the new coalition government can bestow on families is the delivery of low mortgage interest rates. This more than anything else will add confidence to the community and save hundreds of dollars each month off the average mortgage. Already interest rates have fallen since the coalition took office. Provided this very fair and responsible budget survives its passage through the other place, the outlook for continuing low interest rates is bright. I urge honourable senators in the other place not to jeopardise Australia's economic future.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am constantly amazed at how honourable members opposite can stand and criticise the efforts we are making to fix up their mess. Labor's 13 years of mismanagement have created an environment of pessimism and despair, of hopelessness and anguish. It is an environment of their making and the Australian people have had enough. They know it will not be easy, but they know the coalition government have the ability and the determination and commitment to make a positive difference.

         When I hear the moans and groans coming from the other side about this or that measure taken in the budget, I am reminded of a television commercial which is currently going to air in Sydney, and probably throughout the country. It shows people struggling with everyday problems which seem to overwhelm them until they are reminded about the big picture, the ultimate goal, the reason we are struggling to get ahead. That is what this budget is all about. It is about restoring our future, giving hope back to our families, our small business people, our children and our retired people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The result of the election and the way the Australian people have welcomed and accepted this budget overwhelmingly show that the majority of Australians—the young, the old, the workers, the parents and the families—support the government and will continue to support us, despite some difficult measures, because they know the problems facing our great country are not of our doing. They know we are prepared to take the hard decisions to fix up the mess that has been left to us by 13 years of Labor.

         In my electorate of Robertson, the Labor opposition have floundered hopelessly.

With no sound arguments, what have this hopeless Labor opposition done? Have they come up with any constructive suggestions or ideas for the betterment of the Central Coast? No, Mr Deputy Speaker. All they can do is come up with a disgraceful scaremongering campaign amongst the vulnerable in our community, and these disgraceful scare tactics only reinforce the reasons why the people of Robertson threw Labor out of office in March.

         The electorate of Robertson and the Central Coast region is a rapidly growing area which relies almost exclusively on small business.

         I am pleased that the government has been able to fulfil its commitments to road funding, with the massive injections of funds to the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle, despite the difficult budgetary position left to us. Over $803 million will be available in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 for national highways and the new roads of national importance category, which includes the Pacific Highway. An additional $36 million will be spent on the black spots program. This is more than the $833.9 million the previous government spent on national highways in 1995&amp;hyphen;96.

         The Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer government black spots program has been warmly welcomed in Robertson. With the rapid residential growth that has occurred in Robertson over the past decade, our road infrastructure has been struggling to cope. In many areas this has resulted in dangerous intersections and crossings which were never designed to carry the volumes of vehicle or pedestrian traffic they are now experiencing. This has unfortunately led to many accidents resulting in injury or death. Under this black spots program, many of these problem areas will be rectified in the electorate of Robertson with relatively low&amp;hyphen;cost improvements which will return their cost many times over to the community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the first time ever a proportion of the black spots program funding will be available on the basis of road safety surveys. This will allow proactive initiatives. Instead of waiting for a tragic injury toll to highlight the need for safety improvements, work will be able to be undertaken to treat sites before casualties occur. This innovative initiative in road safety clearly demonstrates our government's leadership on road safety issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another example of the road safety initiatives and leadership shown by our government is the preparedness to examine the advantages of intelligent transport systems. These systems are used extensively overseas and the technology currently exists to provide updated electronic information for motorists—
         <break page="5097" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          information such as early warning of accidents or delays ahead, dangerous conditions such as fog or ice, optimum speeds to travel to minimise delays and even which lane or traffic route will provide the quickest travel times.

         This type of intelligent transport system will be of great value on freeway systems such as the F3, which runs through my electorate of Robertson. The F3 freeway, as part of the national highway system, leads on to the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle. The Pacific Highway is the first road to be included in the new roads of national importance program. This budget sets in train a three&amp;hyphen;year program of works for the urgent upgrade of sections of this major highway between Sydney and Brisbane.

         I am concerned about the ability of the section of the F3 freeway in my electorate to cope with traffic adequately. The section of the F3 and Pacific Highway through Mount White is rapidly reaching saturation point. When I was campaigning to re&amp;hyphen;open a closed section of the old Pacific Highway back in 1993, I attended a value management study for this work and I well remember the assessment of the department of transport representatives that the F3 freeway in the vicinity of Mount White was nearing capacity and that within five years regular peak hour delays could occur. Just three years later, commuters and transport operators are experiencing regular peak hour delays on the four&amp;hyphen;lane section of the freeway between the Hawkesbury River and Mount White.

         —Tonight I want to talk about a very important aspect of aged care—home and community care. The treatment of this issue in this government's budget really encapsulates the inadequate, uncaring and the ideology before people agenda of this government. The Liberals are definitely inflicting a very uncaring attitude on this country, particularly when it comes to home and community care. Home and community care consists of support services provided predominantly to older Australians but also to younger people with disabilities and their carers to enable these people to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Without home and community care some type of institutional care would be necessary.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of the relative cost of services to support the frail aged, home and community care is a much more economical option than any of the alternatives. But, more importantly, older people and people with disabilities want to live in their own homes, want their independence and want to maintain their own lives. Home and community care consists of services like meals on wheels, home nursing, home help, home maintenance, gardening, transport, respite care and day care services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Funding for home and community care is provided jointly by the Commonwealth and the states, and service delivery is usually through local government, community or voluntary groups. From the first introduction of a subsidy to voluntary sector home nursing organisations in 1956, home and community care has grown in spurts, usually in response to various reports and inquiries, to its present level of more than half a billion dollars. The greatest growth occurred in the 10 years after 1983, when it increased from 15 per cent to 23 per cent of total aged care funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Seen from another perspective—a very important perspective so far as old people are concerned—there was an 11 per cent reduction in the institutionalisation rates for aged persons over the period from 1988 to 1992. Given the points that I have made about cost and preference, this trend can be seen as a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         positive step both for the economy and for older Australians.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This growth and change in emphasis resulted from the recognition that care in the home and support from the community have two great advantages over institutional care: it is much more economical and it is, in almost every case, the preferred option of older Australians. People overwhelmingly prefer to stay in their own homes for as long as they can, in surroundings that they know and with family, friends and neighbours. It is home and community care that makes this possible.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What these figures reflect is a worldwide trend to a more balanced provision of care for older citizens between institutionalisation and supported care in the home. A recent copy of the OECD
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Observer
        </emphasis>
        talked about this trend. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         . . . the balance should tilt towards services—such as home health care, personal domestic care, meals&amp;hyphen;on&amp;hyphen;wheels and day care services—that support people in their own homes.

       </para>
       <para>
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         This is the other great advantage of home and community care—the support it provides to carers. Carers, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, are the cornerstone of our aged care policy. There are over two million carers in Australia who, by their efforts, are saving the Australian taxpayers millions of dollars every year. Of course, it is then counterproductive to undermine the home and community care services which enable those people to care for older Australians and those with disabilities.

        I will just give one example from my own electorate of Jagajaga. A constituent of mine, a retired professional woman from Heidelberg Heights, has a 99-year-old mother who lives in a country town about 160 kilometres from Melbourne. My constituent's mother manages to live alone in her own home—where she has lived for the last 60 years and which is the place where she really wants to live—thanks to the excellent home and community care provided in that town. The local home and community care service enables both my constituent and her mother to live independent lives.

         writers and policy makers fall into the trap of exaggeration and scaremongering. This can also be  resorted to by governments, such as the one we have opposite, seeking to justify radical and unpopular policy changes—for example the introduction of nursing home entry fees. I will have a lot to say about that in the months to come. But tonight I just want to talk about what this government is doing to home and community care, because of the essential services that it provides in a sensitive way to deal with the increasing numbers of older Australians in our country.

        It is important to remember too that future generations of older Australians will have significantly different expectations about how they will live and be cared for in their old age from those who have gone before them. They will generally be better educated, better prepared financially for retirement and be very determined to maintain an independent lifestyle for as long as they possibly can. The services offered by home and community care are much more appropriate to cater for these preferences—as well as being much more economical, as I said before.
       </para>

        Labor in government showed that it recognised the importance of home and community care. The Liberal Party, in its pre-election determination to present to the public a mirror image of every Labor policy, also committed itself to home and community care and very specifically committed itself to maintaining the real growth of spending on home and community care that Labor had maintained; that is, at six per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But come the budget we find another story. Like so much in this budget, first impressions are generally false impressions, particularly for the aged. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have shown great delight in having sold the Australian people on their budget. This government has received accolades from sections of the media on the cleverness of the selling strategy for this budget. But I would say they would be taking their bows at interval, because older Australians are going to find out that this budget is nothing short of a con, particularly when it comes to home and community care.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         While maintaining that they have kept the real rate of growth of home and community care funding at six per cent, what we see in this budget is another one of these too&amp;hyphen;clever&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;half, smoke and mirrors tricks. In order to maintain the rate of growth of spending on home and community care, they have introduced fees of 20 per cent of the cost of that program. This is an all-time classic case of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The impact will be felt differently between the states, because of the wide variation in user charges that we already have. In Jeff Kennett's Victoria, we have user charges already at around 18 per cent. However, some of the other states have a much better attitude to health care and to aged care. Take New South Wales, for example. The level of fees in that state is much lower. But this government's attitude to the haphazard fees policy that the states have been allowed to develop is not to cut it down to the lowest common denominator but to better Jeff Kennett's effort and to increase user charges to 20 per cent across the board. We estimate that those people using home and community care will be paying on average $7 an hour.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This fee increase is yet another example of giving with one hand and taking with the other. It is another example of carers who have been the recipients of pension increases in this budget having to pay extra for home and community care and other related services. The government should realise that increasing user charges in this way is a funding technique with a very finite lifespan, particularly when it comes to recipients of social security payments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us put this very clearly for the benefit of the government which does not seem to have realised that this robbing Peter to pay Paul policy is a very short&amp;hyphen;term, short&amp;hyphen;sighted policy because the vast majority of home and community care recipients are pensioners—93 per cent in fact. When will the government realise that it might have to increase pensions further so that those pensioners can afford to pay the user charges for home and community care? What a ridiculous, circuitous route for policy making.
        </para>
        <break page="5100" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Home and community care services will always be a much better way to go than the much more expensive nursing home care. Has the government considered that higher fees could inhibit use of home and community care services? It may only be fear of the charge but it might prevent those who need to seek help from getting that help and lead to a general decline in the health and independence of older people and force those older people to seek help from much more expensive services whether it be public hospitals or nursing homes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is particularly worrying when thinking about the high proportion of home and community care clients who use a significant number of services per week. Imagine people having to pay for three and four hours of care while on a pension. It will be out of their reach. This conundrum may exercise the minds of some of those on the opposite side of the House in the coming months. Hopefully, they will realise that it is a very short&amp;hyphen;sighted policy and they will meet their commitment to increase the access to home and community care without introducing these massive fee increases.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government should be encouraging a greater rather than a reduced use of home and community care. It has been estimated by the Australian Council of Social Service and by others that the home and community care program currently meets only half the demand for services and that this demand is increasing by 2.7 per cent per annum. So we have a very long way to go. This increase is driven not only by demographic factors but also by policy developments in other areas such as the decrease in per capita provision of nursing home beds and the wider adoption of early discharge procedures from hospitals, particularly in my home state of Victoria. Unless future funding levels for home and community care are commensurate with need, the viability of the government's wider aged care policy will be undermined as well as the home and community care program itself.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Also of dubious validity is means testing user charges. If these charges are means tested then the income to the government resulting from user charging is unlikely to
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           warrant the administrative cost of collection. At best it can be expected to make only a marginal contribution. Taking into account the administrative costs and the way these increased charges will discourage people from using necessary services, this change introduced in the budget should be immediately reversed.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Does the government appreciate the irony of getting free hospital care—something which Labor strongly endorses and which Labor introduced—for something as expensive as heart surgery, yet having to pay for the cheaper things? Under this government you have to pay for something like meals on wheels.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another irony is that, I am pleased to see, you will be able to continue to get a hip operation in a public hospital—essential to enable older people to walk. That will be free, but then you will have to pay more for the walking frames and other supports needed for home and community care. This could lead to longer stays in hospitals or to people having to be readmitted to hospital because they fell as a result of early discharge and not having had sufficient care at home because they could not afford a walking frame or sufficient home care.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are other areas where this government has acted to reduce the effectiveness of home and community care. At the June Premiers Conference we saw another part of this government's overall cost cutting take three per cent across the board from home and community care. When the government did it, the minister was not even aware that the Treasurer had taken three per cent—$70 million over the next three years—out of this absolutely essential program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Home and community care has to date been jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states but the incentives have come from the Commonwealth. It is the Commonwealth that has really driven the increase in funds for home and community care and the states have matched that program where they could but have not always, I would have to say, been able to. It is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth continue to take a lead and continue to say to the states that this is an
          <break page="5101" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           absolutely critical part of the overall aged care program.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I say this because one of the other very significant proposals that this government is seeking to introduce is to transfer responsibility for all aged care, including home and community care, to the states. With devolution of this type there is a grave danger that very serious problems will arise in the delivery of home and community care. First and foremost, there will not be enough of it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The rationale the government puts forward for greater devolution of home and community care and other aged care services is said to be the savings that will accrue from abolishing duplication and overlap. But they are very small amounts of money considering the half a billion dollars that now goes into home and community care. It has really been the Commonwealth that has driven the increase in home and community care, recognising that it is the preference of older people to stay in their own homes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The loss of Commonwealth influence through devolution will make the job of evening up the discrepancies that exist between the states and the regions that much harder. The Commonwealth has been the driving and financing force in enhancing the range of services offered, supporting the preferences of older Australians and their families and, in particular, supporting carers. All of this is threatened by this government's attempt to get out of its responsibilities to older Australians, to say to the states, `We are not going to do this any more; you can take responsibility for it.' As the President of Aged Care Australia said today:

           The same applies to home and community care. It would be absolutely disastrous if this program, which has provided so much benefit to older Australians and to people with disabilities, were transferred to the states. It will be the case that there will not be enough money to be spent on this program. It will be the case that differences will arise between the states, that some states, such as New South Wales, will continue to see this as a

          I know that there are many on the government side who do not support this devolution. I would say to those people on the back benches of the government: stand up for these highly important programs. In regard to this notion of devolution, this idea of giving up your responsibilities to older Australians, convince the Prime Minister, make it absolutely clear, that we have to maintain these services, that we cannot introduce user charges for home and community care, that if we do introduce these charges we will see more people ending up at the doors of public hospitals.

          We will see more people having to go into nursing homes. We know what that is going to mean to older Australians. But, under this government, they are going to have to pay entry contributions. I have absolutely no doubt what the preference of older Australians will be. It will be to stay in their own homes, to get access to high quality home care. That is the preference of older Australians. It is incumbent on this government to meet those needs and aspirations of older people and not to introduce yet another user charge. Certainly we see no compensation for it in increased pensions. It is yet another example of the heartlessness of this government's attitude to older Australians.

         —On 20 August the Howard government delivered its first budget. It is a budget which addresses fundamental and longstanding weaknesses in the Commonwealth government's financial position. The Australian economy has been growing for five years since the disastrous economic recession of the early 1990s but, despite this growth, the federal budget has remained in deficit. Between 1991-92 and 1995-96 the former Labor government in only five years racked up deficits totalling $69.1 billion.

         so would burden us with high levels of debt, leave us vulnerable to shifts in the international economy and give very little scope to respond to any further future economic downturn. This budget has met the imperative of eliminating the deficit by 1998-99 while delivering on the key commitments made by the coalition to the Australian people at the 1996 election to provide tax relief for Australian families, to maintain Medicare and bulk&amp;hyphen;billing, to introduce incentives for people to take out private health insurance, to provide more equitable tax treatment for self-funded retirees and to give capital gains tax relief to small business.

        The budget task has not been an easy one. I believe that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) deserves our congratulations. But the budget's achievements have been hard won. Significant programs, departments and authorities have been subjected to major expenditure reductions and some have been terminated. The need for financial restraint and the demand for effectiveness makes it vital that all agencies are continually scrutinised to ensure that their funding is warranted. Significant tasks and good intentions are not in themselves enough. Programs and organisations have to deliver.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One agency that I believe is not delivering is the National Crime Authority. The NCA has a wide&amp;hyphen;ranging brief to investigate criminal activity, activity which extends from drug dealing to the illegal export of fauna, illegal activity which is punishable by three or more years imprisonment, which involves more than one offender, substantial organisation and sophisticated methods.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The National Crime Authority has extensive coercive powers. It can compel people to answer questions at private hearings without adequate disclosure of the matter being investigated. It can install listening devices and telephone taps. It can require access to confidential information. These are just some of its powers that can be used in the course of its special investigations.

        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Since its inception in 1984, the NCA has received Commonwealth funding of around $418 million in real terms. In addition to this Commonwealth funding, substantial contributions have been made to the NCA's investi gations by state governments. This year's budget allocates the authority $38.5 million. Since that budget was brought down, the NCA has earned a great deal of adverse comment because of its handling of the Elliott case. I should say that I have known John Elliott personally and worked with him politically for a significant number of years but this has no bearing on my consideration of whether, on the evidence that is available to the parliament, the expenditure on the NCA can be justified.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In my view, a dispassionate examination of the NCA's accountability, the NCA's claim to raise revenue, the number and cost of charges and prison sentences obtained by the NCA in cases it initiates or in cases initiated by its task forces, raises the most substantial questions about whether the NCA's performance warrants the expenditure of substantial amounts of public money.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn first to accountability. It is universally agreed that the agencies which the parliament creates and endows with legislative power and taxpayers' money must be accountable to it. The most fundamental form of accountability required of all government agencies is that the parliament can rely on the statements which authorities make autonomously and freely in their annual reports, and that if any error is made the authority can be relied on to correct this to the parliament. I do not believe that the NCA has met this basic test. The NCA has made statements to the parliament that are not correct and, having found them to be wrong, the NCA has not corrected them.

        The maintenance of misstatements of this sort would be unacceptable from any government agency, but it does beggar the imagination that the NCA, an organisation which uses coercive power to compel people to testify to it under oath in the conduct of its own investigations, having misstated facts to the parliament in its own annual report, did not correct them when the true situation was discovered. And we are not talking about some typographical error. We are talking about an incorrect assertion about a $26 million amended assessment which was central to one of the NCA's key claims about its success. The claim is made on page 8 of the authority's 1994&amp;hyphen;95 annual report that:

        The last Chairman of the NCA, Mr Tom Sherman, in his address to the National Press Club on 18 August 1995, emphasised the claim by saying:

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Office as a result of NCA investigations. Mr Broome, in a letter to me dated 11 September and copied to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, stated:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am advised by the ATO that it is unable to provide details of collections as the ATO does not maintain a register of collections arising as a result of assessments raised against NCA/ATO investigations.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the problem is not just confined to the invalidity of the NCA's claims about tax assessments. The authority also claims that it has achieved significant results in terms of recovering proceeds of crime. In its 1994&amp;hyphen;95 annual report, the authority stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This year proceeds of crime results were down from the high point of $15.3 million recovered in the course of 1993&amp;hyphen;94.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that they certainly were down. They were down to zero; down to nothing. The fact is that 1993&amp;hyphen;94 recoveries of proceeds of crime were not just the NCA's high point; they were about the NCA's only point. Excluding that year, the total proceeds of crime recovered by the NCA through its whole history is $5.8 million—2.4 per cent of its total appropriation for those years. The fact is that, faced with questioning about its role, the NCA tried to represent itself as making major contributions to Commonwealth revenue. Those representations have now been demonstrated not to rest on the facts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at some other measures of the NCA's performance. The crudest of those measures is the number of charges laid by the NCA or its task forces. Between its establishment in 1984 and June 1995, the latest date for which data is available, charges were laid by the NCA or its task forces against 868 people, an average of 79 people per year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Allocating Commonwealth expenditure on the authority over the period to each charge laid, the approximate real cost to the Commonwealth per person charged by the NCA or its task force is some $389,000.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But charges are a very crude measure. A more appropriate measure is probably the significance of its convictions, as measured by the length of sentence. It was only in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 and 1994&amp;hyphen;95 that the information provided by the NCA in its annual reports enabled us to look at this in detail.
       </para>
       <break page="5104" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Between July 1993 and June 1995, proceedings based on NCA or NCA task force charges were finalised in respect of 114 people. In 47 per cent of these proceedings no gaol sentence was imposed; in 23 per cent of cases the gaol term was not more than three years; in 17 per cent of cases gaol terms were between three and six years; and in seven per cent of cases, gaol terms were between six and 10 years. In only five per cent of cases—six people—were sentences of more than 10 years gaol imposed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Overall, apportioning the expenditure by the Commonwealth on the NCA to each gaol sentence imposed as a direct result of NCA or NCA task force investigations, the cost per gaol sentence is $1.453 million. This does not include the substantial expenditure by the states, territories and other Commonwealth authorities on these cases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no standard benchmark against which the significance of convictions can be measured. But it is pertinent to note that the NCA act restricts the authority to investigating crimes punishable by gaol terms of three years or more. Of the 114 proceedings initiated by the NCA and finalised in the period examined, only 38 people were sentenced to gaol terms of three years or more.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A further measure of the NCA's performance is its ability to mount investigations that yield evidence accepted by the courts. The NCA's record in this area is less than overwhelming.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Two of its major recent cases, the Elliott case and the so&amp;hyphen;called bikies case have been thrown out of court because the reference under which the investigation was mounted could not sustain utilisation of the coercive powers of the authority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of important issues involved here, but I merely want to focus on the issues of organisational proficiency. The transcript of the Elliott case shows that the NCA's initial notice of reference was examined by Messrs Merkle and Middleton QC. They advised that the notice was invalid because it did not sufficiently define the matter to be investigated. A new notice was drafted by Messrs Rozenes and Lorkin which was valid but in the event was still found to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          be insufficient to support the investigation undertaken, because that investigation did not fall within the notice's more precise terms.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But it is not just the Elliott case; in the bikies case the reference was very similar to the initial Elliott notice which Merkle and Middleton believed would be found invalid. To run such a reference, against expert advice, was nothing short of remarkable. In the event, the Federal Court concluded in the bikies case that the reference was invalid for the same reasons that the earlier Elliott reference was so considered.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have been allegations of political motivation, the tall poppy syndrome and so on made to explain why the NCA mounted the Elliott investigation. I will leave those for others to canvass. But one widely recognised motive is that the NCA had been given enormous amounts of money by the Labor Party for which it had to find a use.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The press put it graphically. One journalist referred to the then Chairman of the NCA, Peter Faris, as doing `the rounds of all the offices and asking, "Got anything we might be interested in?"' Another journalist refers to the Elliott investigation being designed to lift the NCA `out of a rut of drug related investigations into the more cerebral of white collar crime . . . The NCA had plenty of funds so Faris asked Bosch for a piece of the action'. Put a little more blandly, the former head of the Australian Securities Commission, Henry Bosch, stated in his letter to Mr Faris of 16 November 1989:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I understand that the National Crime Authority is interested in the field of breaches of the companies and securities law, and that it would be able to take on a small number of major investigations. I understand further that you have substantial resources available, at least by our standards.
        </para>
        <para>
         The formulations may vary; some of the statements may be racier than others, but the fundamental message comes through clearly: the NCA was all cashed up and it was looking for somewhere to go. It had lots of money and it was searching for a cause. Where it went was to mount a case that cost the taxpayers between $10 million and $42 million. The estimates vary but take a midpoint and you have $21 million. It is certainly true the
         <break page="5105" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          investigation and prosecution of the case cost tens of millions of dollars. In the course of this case, the NCA had acted unlawfully and, ultimately, it could not even get the case before the jury.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important to note that this massive expenditure of public money on an investigation in the course of which the authority behaved unlawfully was not some personal aberration on the part of Mr Faris; it was part of a broader institutional failure. The investigation was pursued under every one of the NCA's chairmen since Mr Faris: Mr Leckie, Mr Justice Phillips, Mr Sherman and Mr Broome. Being chairman of the NCA at that stage was a bit like going through a revolving door.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The short message is that the devil makes work for idle hands. The longer message is: do not give an agency with vast coercive powers which is searching for fresh fields too much money; it will probably find some way of wasting it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fight against organised crime is of basic importance to Australia and to this government. It is a complex and difficult fight, and it must be prosecuted effectively with the highest levels of competence. Unfortunately the record of the NCA does not, I believe, fall within this goal. I believe that the authority's funding and mandate do need to be the subject of an urgent and independent judicial review.

         —The Howard government's first budget is a budget of deceit and a budget of betrayal. It is a budget littered with broken promises and a budget which, with respect to program funding cuts, hits hardest those with the least ability to wear the brunt of those cuts. I refer to the aged, the sick, mothers who seek employment and, most importantly, the unemployed.

        This is a budget based on prejudice. It is a budget which will widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. It is a budget which sells Australia short as a nation. It stifles creativity, and it will deny many Australians fair access to higher education. It fails to recognise the importance of the contribution our regions make to our economic wellbeing,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and it fails to recognise that our regions cannot grow without a decent financial contribution by the Commonwealth to infrastructure projects such as the national highway system and the rural telecommunications upgrade program.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, this budget has effectively abandoned rural and regional Australia. The abolition of the division of regional development and the effective abolition of the former Labor government's regional development program are an outrage and reflect the coalition's misguided belief that a national government has no role to play in the area of regional development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This, of course, is nothing new. It was the Curtin Labor government which first effectively involved the Commonwealth in regional development, and it was the Menzies government which taketh away. The Commonwealth did not become a player again until the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. Of course, Malcolm Fraser showed no interest at all. Again, it took the election of a Labor government to the Commonwealth parliament to restore the Commonwealth's involvement in regional development policy. I quote as an example the former government's very successful regional development program and the regional development organisations which were established as part of that program. It is obvious that history is simply repeating itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the greatest outrage of all contained within this budget is its desertion of the unemployed. Prior to the March election, we heard ad nauseam from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the wonderful things he would do for the unemployed in this nation. I can still see the now Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) bleating on our television screens every night of the week about the higher than acceptable level of youth unemployment in this country. What has been the government's response to unemployment, in particular youth unemployment? It has been the massive slashing of the former government's labour market programs, the effective abolition of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the slashing of tens of thousands of public sector jobs.

         The government's own budget documents admit that unemployment is not expected to improve over the next 12 months. We now have the principal author of a report produced by the Institute of Labour Studies—a report commissioned by the government's own minister—saying the government's labour market reforms, the very thing the Prime Minister tells us will precipitate an improvement in employment, will do nothing to reduce unemployment over the next four years. In Senate estimates less than two weeks ago Treasury officials admitted that the net impact of the government's budget will be to reduce growth and therefore to reduce jobs.

Kurri Contracting Service engages the services of Kurri skillshare to provide that training. I want to read to the House the letter I have received from and signed by six of those employees. It says:

If we had the money for training we would be able to catch the bus on their own and may be get their licence and also some of the workers could be affected by the funding, some of workers could be given the sack so please could you do something.

         The government wants residents in Singleton, in my electorate, to travel to Maitland or Cessnock to access the skillshare program.

Public transport between Singleton and Cessnock is absolutely non-existent and one train travels daily to Maitland.

         Skillshare is a very successful program and the government's decision to gut it can only be put down to ideology. Just as successful as skillshare was the new work opportunities program.

         But how can one reconcile the government's decision to cut funding for the new enterprise incentive scheme? This scheme is the most cost&amp;hyphen;effective labour market program of all. The scheme really has been a great success story. Before its inception, people would go to their federal member and say, `I'm sick of being on the dole. I want to work. I want to get my self&amp;hyphen;esteem back. I have a business idea. I'm confident it can work, but there are risks involved. How will I feed my family if it all goes wrong, considering that the government would immediately remove from me my unemployment benefit? Surely there should be some recognition of the risk and some incentive for me to have a go.'

         The new enterprise incentive scheme for the first time provided these people with an opportunity to have a go, the opportunity to get off the merry&amp;hyphen;go&amp;hyphen;round.

         Those in the coalition hold the belief that, if you are unemployed and you really want a job, you will get one. What arrogance! What are the unemployed to think of this budget?

          One of their challenges is to maintain the critical mass of children needed to keep the centre open, to keep it viable. The additional cost of the decision to remove the operational subsidy upon parents will mean that some parents will be forced to take their children out of child care. In many rural centres, this will mean that the child&amp;hyphen;care centre will lose that critical mass necessary to make that particular centre viable and that means there will be no child care available at all in these areas.

          Community based long day care centres in my electorate have already calculated the rises in fees they charge as a result of this decision. At the Singleton child&amp;hyphen;care centre, fees will increase from $31 to $34.85 per day, or $155 to $174.85 per week. At child-care centres right across my electorate the average percentage of operational subsidy to total budget costs is around 10 and 11 per cent.

I want to say, very quickly, that the town of Murrurundi in my electorate has twice been inundated by flood in the last six months, and it is currently making application for assistance to undertake a study to overcome its problem.

           This budget really does represent a great con. What the government has done is overemphasise the extent of the budget deficit. Indeed, it has even changed the whole defini tion of a `budget deficit' in order to overimpress the need to wind the budget back to balance in order that it can excuse itself for its ideological drive to wind back welfare services in this nation. I do not think the Australian people will accept the con. As time goes on they will wake up to it and, in three years time, they will reject this government.

         —This budget is a watershed in recent fiscal history. It is a budget which at last faces reality. It is a budget which recognises that we have to pay our way. It is a budget which recognises that we cannot keep spending money we do not have. It is a budget which accepts that there is no magic pudding from which governments can endlessly carve slices. It is a budget which recognises that it is not their money that governments spend but it is taxpayers' money, and that this brings a responsibility of care in the way it is spent.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In all these respects, this budget stands as a great contrast to those of the previous government. The policies of the previous government left this country in an appallingly vulnerable position. In the last five years, their policies had increased Commonwealth government debt from $23 billion to $97 billion—an increase of over 300 per cent. Since 1990, Commonwealth government debt has blown out from four per cent of GDP to 19 per cent, and this would have kept rising without corrective action.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When this government came to office on 2 March, we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 billion and a legacy of policies that were leading Australia further down the path of deficit, debt and despair.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This budget tackles the problem head on. It aims at returning the budget to balance over the next three years by reducing the deficit to $5.6 billion next year, $1.5 billion the year after and a small surplus by 1998&amp;hyphen;99. This is absolutely vital if we are to provide hope for our children.

        Under Labor, national savings had fallen to alarming levels. Not only had the previous government discouraged private sector savings, which had fallen from 10 per cent of household incomes when they came to office
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to just over one per cent; they had also been detracting from it by their own policies of dissaving, acting as a drain on national savings. What is worse, they were not borrowing for investment—in fact, infrastructure spending fell as a percentage of GDP from 7.6 per cent to less than five per cent under Labor—but borrowing in order to finance current expenditure, in many cases simply to buy votes.

        What was their approach to the debt problem? To deny it was a problem, to ignore it, to hope it would go away on its own. It will not go away on its own. The blow-out in government debt, the collapse of national savings, is a desperate problem not just in itself but because of its impact on the rest of the economy and on the lives of people throughout the country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me look at four areas. Firstly, it has led to a blow-out in our current account deficit and in our foreign debt. As a result of its extravagance, its inability to live within its means, Labor left Australia with the worst current account deficit in the OECD and with a net foreign debt of $180 billion—a rise of 700 per cent from $23 billion when it came into office.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This tells only half the story. The sale of Australian assets overseas—assets including Australian icons such as Arnott's, King Gee, Aeroplane Jelly, National Mutual, Lifesavers, Tooheys, Sidchrome, Peters, Edgells and many others—over the 13 years of this government brings our total net external liabilities to $280 billion. They were selling off the farm at an extravagant rate to pay the bills to live beyond their means. Make no mistake, this is a result of our lack of savings, a result exacerbated by the previous government's inability to control their spending and debt. It is no good the opposition trying to deny this. The Reserve Bank, in its annual report, says it very clearly on page 15:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ongoing large Current Account Deficit and rising external liabilities are the results of Australia's poor savings record. The declining level of national savings since the mid 1970s mainly reflects lower public sector savings . . . largely because of lower savings by the Commonwealth Government. The most effective way of raising
        <break page="5110" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         national saving, within a realistic timeframe, is to move the budget into surplus.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly what we are intending to do—move the budget into surplus. It goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        International experience shows that structural cuts in budget deficits consistently have a favourable effect on the Current Account position.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly what we intend to see happen. The other side can play ostrich economics all they like. They can stick their heads in the sand and ignore the facts, but the bottom line is that their gross mismanagement over the past decade or so has left us in a terrible mess. This budget is a big step towards turning things around.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, by reducing the deficit and debt we stop the blow&amp;hyphen;out in interest payments and the shocking waste of taxpayers' money. In the last five years, interest payments on Commonwealth government debt have risen from $6 billion a year to $10 billion a year. This is $10 billion of taxpayers' money down the drain each year—money that could have been spent on education, on health, on infrastructure, on essential services; $10 billion that has been lost because of the failure of the previous government. What a tragic waste. Without a definite change in direction this would have continued to rise and it would have been a growing and inexcusable drain on taxpayers' money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Thirdly, the policy of deficit and debt run by the previous government has added to the level of domestic interest rates in the Australian economy. Again, they have been playing ostrich economics on this one, ignoring reality, deluding themselves and attempting to delude the Australian people. Much has been said on this already, but it is perhaps sufficient to quote Bernie Fraser, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, on this one. In his media release on 31 July this year, announcing a drop in official interest rates, Bernie Fraser put it beyond doubt with these words:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Today's action by the Reserve Bank in no way diminishes the urgency of the task confronting the government of reducing the budget deficit. As the Bank has emphasised on many occasions, further progress in reducing the budget deficit is critical to both increasing national saving and delivering lower interest rates over the medium term.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        `The urgency of the task,' he said, `emphasised on many occasions . . . is critical.' He says it repeatedly. It is no good the opposition deluding themselves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Standard and Poor's, the international rating agency, has already responded to the budget by raising our international credit rating. This will mean lower interest rates on foreign loans. The previous government, by contrast, left Australia with amongst the highest real interest rates in the Western world. Labor's high deficit, high interest rate policy was deadly for small business, deadly for home buyers and deadly for families. Our policy of deficit reduction has already pushed interest rates down. It will keep interest rates down. This has to be good news for struggling small business and families paying off their mortgages.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, by reducing the budget deficit, this budget sets the stage for long-term growth, regardless of what the other side tries to tell us. Firstly, by lowering interest rates we make it much cheaper for business to invest, to expand and to employ. Secondly, by reducing the pressure on the current account deficit we can grow the economy faster without hitting the wall. We will not have to endure the stop-start policies of Labor building up a head of steam and then hitting the brakes because of a blow-out on the current account deficit. This was why the previous government hit the brakes so hard in 1990, with skyrocketing interest rates plunging us into the worst recession since the Great Depression and unemployment of over a million people on the books—and probably even more than that hidden—over 11 per cent of the work force.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Responsible fiscal management will alleviate this roller-coaster ride. It sets the path for long&amp;hyphen;term sustainable growth and a reduction in unemployment that we have heard so much about from the other side. These conclusions are echoed by Dr Vince FitzGerald who headed the previous government's inquiry into national savings. He said in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        on 22 August this year:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because the fiscal consolidation measures are weighted predominantly towards savings in government expenditure . . . most of these gains in public
        <break page="5111" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         saving will reflect in the bottom line of national saving. . . In turn, more domestic investment, both private and public, will be financed out of the increased domestic saving; and the external deficit should also gradually fall. In time, this will reflect a lower premium in Australian interest rates . . . lowering the hurdle to business investment. These effects will flow on over time to better and better growth in activity, jobs and incomes.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        This is exactly what we want, this is exactly what we need and this is exactly what the other side failed to deliver. So much for the pathetic objections coming from the opposition. So much for the myopic, simplistic short&amp;hyphen;term Keynesian approach of those opposite.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point is that this budget is the first serious attempt in many years to tackle the country's underlying economic problems. The government's strategies over the next three years will increase the level of national savings, reduce our vulnerability to international shocks, put downward pressure on interest rates and set up sustainable growth in investment, jobs and living standards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What a contrast to what we have had over the last 13 years: a record of growing debt, high interest rates, long-term unemployment and lower living standards. This government inherited these problems. We did not create them but we are certainly on the road to fixing them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other thing worth pointing out here is that this is not just a matter of theoretical economics. It very directly affects the way we live. Unless we are producing enough, unless we are encouraging business investment, unless we are creating a climate in which businesses want to employ and in which people want to work, unless we have sustainable growth, everyone's living standards will be affected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other side's ineffectual, repeated bleating about our policies being heartless and lacking compassion is certainly based on a strange definition of compassion. Is it compassionate to mortgage the future of our kids so that we can continue to live beyond our means? Is that compassionate? That is what the previous government was doing and that is what the opposition would seem to have us still do.

        <para first-indent="16">
         At a national level, we are well and truly on the way to correcting these problems. Let me come down to a more local level. This budget offers much to the people of my electorate, the people of Macquarie. First, the family tax package offers significant relief for low and middle income earners, particularly those with young families. For instance, a one income family with two dependent children, private health insurance and earning less than $68,000 a year will get an increase in disposable income of $51.90 a fortnight. That is a boost for low and middle income earners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Second, the reduction in home loan interest rates we have already seen will greatly help the 13,500 home buyers in Macquarie. Continued downward pressure on interest rates should continue to reduce the monthly mortgage payments of Macquarie's families.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Third, the Richmond RAAF base will receive $15 million from this budget, including the construction of a $12.2 million health centre at Richmond and $3.6 million for the construction of live&amp;hyphen;in facilities, reflecting an ongoing commitment of the government to the Richmond RAAF base, which is so important to the economy of the Hawkesbury.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fourth, the funding of $189,000 for local landcare projects will assist committed local landcare groups working throughout the electorate on the local environment. Fifth, a number of initiatives will greatly assist the 4,000 small businesses in Macquarie, the chief generators of jobs. These initiatives include: the removal of the capital gains tax on business rollover and the reduction in the uplift factor provisional tax. In addition to other measures such as a reduction in business regulation and workplace relations reform, this will make it easier for small business to survive, to grow and to employ.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Sixth, a more reasoned approach to job training will see real hope rather than the cover&amp;hyphen;up that we have had in the past. The previous government's labour market programs, which have cost taxpayers billions of dollars over the past few years, have achieved very little in creating full&amp;hyphen;time jobs. This government's increased spending on vocational education and training, up to $889 million for next year, and the introduction of the
         <break page="5112" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          modern Australian apprenticeship and training scheme will greatly tackle the question of job readiness at its source.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Seventh, the government's aged care structural reform package will do much to address some of the significant shortcomings in residential aged care, an area of significant need in Macquarie. In spite of the deceitful and shameful scaremongering by Labor, this provides the opportunity for a much needed injection of capital into nursing homes which will benefit all residents. It tackles a glaring capital crisis which the Gregory report highlighted but the previous government was unwilling to tackle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our policy also removes the outdated and artificial separation between hostel and nursing home care which often caused heart&amp;hyphen;rending separation between couples when one partner became increasingly frail and had to move from hostel accommodation to a nursing home. It is apparent that the opposition did not really care about this problem. They did nothing to try to solve it. Again, the courage of this government in tackling a difficult issue in an open and equitable way is in enormous contrast to the delusion, procrastination and deceit of the previous government. Other policies such as the expanded respite care strategy and an increase of over six per cent for the home and community care program will also help the aged people in my electorate.          The second unique feature and outstanding strength of the government's approach to this budget is the charter of budget honesty. No longer will the real budget position be lost in a maze of creative accounting. There will be no more smoke and mirrors tricks and no more dishonest and deceitful assurances that all is well, only to find that, after years of asset sales, all we have left is a massive hole. A number of changes will make the budget reporting process and fiscal strategy more transparent, more open to public scrutiny and more honest. Stripped of all the cover&amp;hyphen;ups, the naked truth will be there for all to see—for better or worse.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          This budget is a watershed: firstly, because of the responsible, courageous and honest way in which it addresses our fundamental eco nomic problems instead of trying to ignore them and, secondly, because of the direction it gives for the future transparency of fiscal policy in this country.
         </break>
        </para>

         Yet what sort of response have we seen from the minor parties? Cheap, political opportunism. And what would you expect? The opposition have targeted billions of dollars worth of our savings over the next four years that they may reject; yet they say they want to correct the deficit over three years. They  cannot have it both ways. Where will they find the savings? Perhaps they will tell us where they would find the savings. Perhaps they would like to make some suggestions.

His question apparently arose from proceedings in the House on 19 September.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As has been indicated in the House previously, following my election as Speaker I agreed that the Chief Opposition Whip could speak at the dispatch box when speaking in his capacity as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business.

         This is not an easy question but I have concluded that it would be inconsistent with the principle that the front benches on the Speaker's left are reserved for members of the opposition executive if the Chief Opposition Whip was allowed to occupy the front bench and speak from the dispatch box when the Manager of Opposition Business is actually present in the chamber.

         Accordingly, I have today informed the Chief Opposition Whip that, when he is speaking in his capacity as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, when the manager is not present, he can speak from the dispatch box. When the Manager of Opposition Business is present in the chamber and the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business is seconding a procedural motion moved by the manager or speaking at the direction of the manager on procedural matters, he may speak from the dispatch box. When he is speaking on matters which are not related to the duties of Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, the Chief Opposition Whip should speak from his usual place in the chamber.

         —One of the more enjoyable aspects of being a member of parliament is attending local community activities of schools, senior citizens, scouts and girl guides. High on the list of these activities that I have attended are various ethnic functions. In the last few weeks alone, my wife and I have attended functions as diverse as Kurdish, Italian and Tongan ones.

        Australia is built on the shoulders of people from every country. A majority of us have only been here for one or two generations. As members of federal parliament, we possibly see more of the contribution that ethnic Australians are making to the Australian way of life than would most other Australians. We are also more aware of the deep desire of these groups to fit into the Australian community. I am extremely proud to support these desires and I am doing all that I can to see that this really works.

         There are 3&amp;half; million Australians and their children who come from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. They are not going away. We cannot wish diversity away. We should accept our responsibilities. The question is whether we will have a tolerant diverse society or whether we let diversity become a point of division and weakness. I therefore believe we, as parliamentarians, all have a greater responsibility and a duty to assist in assimilating these groups into mainstream Australia.

         This is particularly important in an electorate such as Greenway where there are over 120 different ethnic groups and where over 25 per cent of the population were born overseas. In the six months that I have been the member for Greenway, I have attended four citizenship ceremonies. This has involved on each occasion something between 200 and 300 people. The number of countries of origin has varied from time to time but generally it has been up to 100 different backgrounds.

         All of these people have voluntarily determined to become Australian citizens and they have stood very proudly at the ceremonies as they stated their allegiance to Australia. We who were present and who were born in Australia cannot ever begin to understand what each of these wonderful new Australians must have been feeling as they tackled this important step of choosing to become citizens of another land. They are to be commended for their actions and I have regularly done so.

         One of the peak organisations operating locally that is assisting in the assimilation process is the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. This centre provides a range of services to our ethnic community such as counselling, advising on issues such as housing, employment and health, as well as referring clients to other organisations for assistance, such as AMES.

          With such a large diverse ethnic population in Greenway, it is important that there is a peak organisation, such as the Migrant Resource Centre, so that the ethnic community speaks as nearly as possible with one voice. One function that the Migrant Resource Centre organised most recently was Carnivale. The City of Blacktown Carnivale 1996 com menced on Saturday, 7 September and concluded on Sunday, 29 September. Carnivale was conducted on a state&amp;hyphen;wide basis, with the Blacktown promotion being the second largest outside of central Sydney.

         The art and craft exhibition displayed artwork by western Sydney artists and groups. There were Aboriginal, multicultural, contemporary and traditional craftwork demonstrations. It was a fantastic array of cultural displays from around the world and these activities enabled the whole community to participate. I want to particularly thank Ellen Brown, who was the chairperson of the organisation committee, and her very hard working committee for the wonderful job they did in organising Carnivale 1996.

         On Saturday 14 September I also attended a tree planting and foundation stone laying ceremony at a site in Glendenning in western Sydney. The Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga in Australia intends to build a community centre on this site. Members of the Tongan royal family and several thousand members of the Tongan community attended the function.

         As is usual with many ethnic groups, the musical part of this function was most outstanding. One can see how we in Australia can benefit greatly from the cultural and musical input of ethnic Australians. I believe the building of community centres, as is envisaged by the Tongan community at Glendenning, also assists ethnic Australians, particularly older people, to assimilate into our country.

I wish to draw to the attention of the House a very important program that we ran in the electorate of McMillan, a Victorian country electorate.

        Less fortunate people can't afford basic necessities like food, clothes, services and shelter.

        To stop poverty we as a Community could start to make more Community Benefit Centres with basic necessities. Also unemployment cheques for the unemployed. We definitely need more training centres and cheaper fees for schools to get a better education.

        To help people find jobs they need training centres like C.E.S. They are doing their best but they need more funding. Closing C.E.S down wouldn't do much good. The Government needs to try and encourage industries to create jobs.

        It seems poverty has gone beyond the undeniable stage, and it is now vital that it ought to be recognized and solved. The money invested in the solution for poverty seems to be focused on hiding the problem from the more affluent districts, while the dilemma still waits to be solved. People have nowhere to live or nothing to eat. Children and teenagers live alone on the unmerciful streets. Squatters find "homes" in vacant houses or deserted blocks. Drugs have gone beyond the junkie. Young families struggle to pay the bills.

        Poverty seems to circulate, like a food chain. It begins with a poor family who have lost hope. Children are raised with no family values, and do not strive for achievement. As these children grow older they do not aim to succeed, but turn to stealing, drugs and other violent acts. It is an entire moral breakdown. But where do we start to resolve the issue? A suggestion would be that we should look to the future and focus on the next generation. Instead of trying to correct the adult past use date, why not concentrate on the youth.

        Young people seem to have no values or will. Why not encourage them to achieve and then honor their acquirements. At my school, and others, children of poverty stricken families exist. These persons cannot afford school fees, uniforms or even stationary. This causes embarrassment that leads to low self-esteem. As children raised in poverty have had a restricted learning environment; rather than assessing them on their attained level of achievement, we ought to focus on their efforts and oversee their well being with full time student welfare teachers. This approach would provide encouragement and direction.

        The Australian Government supplies child welfare money for parents. In some cases, although, the parents waste this money by feeding their alcoholic desires or pumping it through poker machines. It may be possible to set up a system to be sure the children are benefitting from the money that they receive food, clothing and other necessities directly and objectively.

        As a country, we need to ensure there is employment available for everyone that wants a job and an effective welfare system for those who can't work or the dependents of those who won't. Poverty's evil does not penetrate just on the "poor people's" lives. We all suffer from it one way of another, through increased violence and vandalism. I feel sure that the massive expenditure used in fighting these crimes would be better spent if we started at the foundation of the problem and eliminated poverty.

        Given the media attention today to the wish for the Liberal Party in the ACT to turn the ACT into a state, I looked very carefully at the issues that the Liberal Party of the ACT have put on the agenda for the forthcoming council. I have to commend them because they have six very important issues: electoral enrolment, ACT statehood, state and territorial jurisdictions, tax and welfare fraud, voluntary student unionism and the Centenary of Federation—all very riveting subjects when you talk about the health of the economy and the health of the community in this town.

        What about the things that really matter to the families of the ACT? The local economy, jobs and security for their future. Let me give this House some figures and a bit of a thumbnail sketch of the situation in which my constituents find themselves—a very serious situation despite the smirks opposite. The ABS August unemployment figures show a trend unemployment rate in the ACT of 8.9 per cent, which is above the national average for the first time ever. There are now 15,000 people looking for work in the ACT, up from 11,700 in March 1995. Youth unemployment is now 50 per cent.

        But the news gets worse. Job vacancies, measured by the ANZ job advertisement series, fell 10 per cent in September. There were only 274 jobs advertised in the ACT in September. Job vacancies have fallen for six

        This federal Liberal government and the ACT Liberal government are responsible absolutely for the situation the ACT finds itself in. My constituents deserve better; they deserve to be treated fairly; and they deserve to be treated seriously. Their household price value is dropping at a rate that the real estate market cannot handle. We now have a federal housing policy which is going to allow the local government to dispose of housing currently owned by government at a rate unprecedented in this country.

        I am so depressed at hearing business people in the local economy—not Labor supporters—come to me and say, `My business turnover has dropped 30 per cent in the last six months. I don't know what to do to stop the downturn.' No wonder my constituency holds in total contempt the promise given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he said that he would govern for all Australians. Rubbish! He has totally and absolutely decided that he will not live here; he will travel to and fro; and he will create a huge bill to the VIP airline which he uses. In the meantime, he will totally disregard the ACT and hold in absolute contempt the people in this town.

        I can only repeat: when you represent a constituency where youth unemployment is 50 per cent, where unemployment figures are above the national average for the first time since records have been held, when you have 15,000 people looking for work, and where you have 274 jobs advertised in the ACT in September—someone has to wear responsibility, someone has to be made to be held to account.

        I would also like to talk about the Commonwealth dental health program. I very much supported some of the measures of the program, although it was done very much as a 1993 election push in an endeavour to get the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, re-elected and it was done without any real thought as to its implementation. It ended up resulting in the states withdrawing their
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         funding from public dental health. The program had a four-year funding life span. By December of this year, the program would have reached the former government's target of providing assistance to 1.5 million people over four years and would have spent some $247 million.

        I was extremely concerned with a letter I received from a local dentist yesterday. He told me that this system has been open to the most extraordinary rorting. This should cause all members in this House very deep concern. My constituent dentist told me that the level of funding which was given for some fairly basic services was very low. It barely provided enough to cover the costs of statutory infection controls that the dental board required in all dental practices.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This constituent went on to tell me that he rang one of the local agencies that was dispensing this money on behalf of the state government and the Commonwealth complaining about the cost of extraction, and he was told that he should `put down a surgical extraction and add a few other numbers to get the maximum available fee'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are two types of extractions, the simple extraction worth about $30&amp;hyphen;odd and a surgical extraction worth about $70. The voucher is for about $100. So my constituent dentist was told that to make it worth his while, he should top it up by putting down an item that was not there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are extremely serious matters. The system has been rorted. The money should have been spread a lot further. Indeed, there is now a very clear indication that items have been put on these accounts to the Commonwealth government—put on the chit to the Australian taxpayer—either for work that was not done or, as I have also been told, for work that was done but which was not needed. It is a matter of great shame.

        But I am pleased now to inform the House that recently on the site Lend Lease and ADI presented to the state minister, the Hon. Craig Knowles, their latest plans for the site of about 1,500 hectares. It is really great.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some 630 hectares will be preserved for open space. This is without parallel in any other development of which I am aware. In fact, 65 of those hectares will form wetlands. In my electorate at Plumpton we have wetlands of one hectare which have won numerous awards. Imagine what wetlands of 65 hectares will do.

        In addition, the consortium have plans to link this green space of 630 hectares via a corridor through to the Richmond and Werrington campuses of the University of Western Sydney. They are proposing to set up a trust worth $100 million to manage and develop the conservation plan for this site. Indeed, the founder of Clean Up Australia will be the inaugural chairman and he was also out there on the site. In addition, there will be an Aboriginal cultural centre and an environment park—all exciting, unique parts of the development.

        The best thing, perhaps, is that the project will be worth $13.2 billion over 15 years. Each year, once the go&amp;hyphen;ahead is given—and the minister has indicated he will make a decision at the end of the year—there will be some 1,100 jobs during the construction. That is great news in an economy which, disappointingly, is in a downturn. But after it is finished, some 12,000 permanent jobs will be created as a result of this development, half on&amp;hyphen;site and half off&amp;hyphen;site. I can think of no development in recent time or even before where so much effort has been put into job creation, because in the western suburbs of Sydney the norm has been that they have been great dormitory suburbs with people leaving homes, leaving their area and finding employment outside. The project will create about 10,000 new homes. I have always been an advocate and a strong supporter of this

        Also I have been involved with the Lebanese Maronite Franciscan Missionaries, who are hoping to set up a parish and a school there. It was great that Father General of the order, the Most Reverend George Harb, has been out to Australia, and I have been able to meet with the good fathers at Orchard Hills and again at the feast this Monday at Rosehill Racecourse for the Feast of St John the Apostle.

        I know the go&amp;hyphen;ahead has not been given for the project and will not be given until the end of the year, but I welcome the opportunity of having the Lebanese Maronite Franciscan Missionaries establish in my electorate as part of this development. I know that they will serve the community very well and be an important focus for Maronites in my electorate and surrounding areas. I certainly hope that their dreams and their vision come to pass and they will be able to settle on the land that they have identified and develop as they sincerely hope to.

         —I would like to take a few moments to add to my comments earlier today on claims by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) that were factually inaccurate and the inference that I was not aware of what was going on in my electorate in relation to nursing homes. I would like to share with this House the very successful visit the minister and I made very recently to the Association for the Blind's George Vowell Centre in Mount Eliza. The centre has given the age care reforms that were announced in the budget a very generous tick.

        For the purposes of completeness, I would like to conclude my comments from earlier in the day and add the information of which I have subsequently been advised. There are two nursing homes in Mount Eliza, not one. My earlier remarks conveyed the information obtained from the operators that neither facility  had  residents  in  them  with  a child

         During my recent visit to the George Vowell centre I became aware that one particular resident in care has a sensory impairment and multiple disabilities. It has been pointed out to me that that person is also a non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent of a 13&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old child. Notwithstanding that point, the visit did reinforce to me that the government's new instrument for classifying people in age care accommodation should take account of sensory impairment and multiple disabilities, given the additional care requirement placed on the operators of centres with such residents.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also highlights to me that, once again, not many residents in nursing homes in my electorate, or certainly Mount Eliza, have children under the age of 16 and also that centres like the George Vowell and the Association for the Blind are doing an excellent job for my community, and I commend their work to the House.

         —I finished my speech yesterday by saying something about the new traineeship and apprenticeship schemes which the present federal government has announced in the federal budget. As we all know, of course, the number of apprenticeships in Australia has dropped to the lowest level per capita in 30 years. Some of the training schemes that were in vogue under the previous government did not seem to be able to do anything about this situation. In my electorate, there are communities whose very future depends on having skilled tradesmen.

         What we are worried about in rural Australia is the setting up of industrial bases: light industry and heavy industry. Even on the farm, because it is a highly technical operation now, we must have skilled people. If, in an area where a business is expanding, people find they cannot get skilled tradesmen, there is a very fair chance they will move out of that area and move into the capital cities, thus increasing the problems of the capital cities and helping rural Australia to die. I am certainly very pleased to learn about the new apprenticeship schemes the federal government is going to implement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the other major problems facing rural Australia is the matter of the provision of health facilities and, particularly, of doctors. Under the federal government's budget proposals there will be a comprehensive initiative to boost rural health, including scholarships to attract more doctors to rural areas, and six university departments of rural health. The first ones have been announced in Mount Isa and in Broken Hill, which was formerly in my electorate. We are very pleased to hear about that. It is great news for those areas facing a shortage of doctors. In many areas, the doctors who have been working there for many years are getting older and they will be looking to retire very shortly, and this will increase the problem. The government has recognised that problem and is taking urgent steps to attract doctors to rural areas, and it is delivering policies aimed at achieving that goal.

         There was a scare campaign before the federal election that Medicare offices would be closing in a number of areas. We have heard nothing about that from the coalition. In fact, when I questioned the minister about that, he said there was certainly no list and he did not know who would prepare the list for those Medicare offices that were to close. Certainly, we are hoping that, in some areas where we do not have Medicare offices, the pharmacies will be able to handle that situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing I would like to mention is national child immunisation. Presently, it is a disgrace in Australia that we are one of the most advanced nations on earth but that immunisation has dropped dramatically, probably to its lowest ebb in many years. People are taking a risk with their children and with our community. I know there are a number of people who do not believe in immunisation, but most of the problem is apathy. We really have to get out amongst the community and make sure that those young children who can be immunised against diseases that we thought were gone some years ago are protected from those diseases. If they are, of course, it will save a lot of anguish, heartache and illness within our community.

         I have touched on many things in the budget. There are plenty of other things I could talk about, but one of the things I would like to speak about is a matter touched on in question time yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) under the heading of Aboriginal stolen children. I think the title is very unfortunate. I would like to mention a matter that is something I do not talk about much: my own experience about 45 years ago. I must say that it is diabolical, there is no doubt about it: to have to take children from parents is a very difficult situation. I will tell you my own story because I think it touches on this very subject.

         When I was a young boy of 10 years of age I was taken from my parents. The reason I was taken from them was because they could not look after me. It was just unfortunate. My parents had difficulties—I will not go into those now—and I was taken from them and put into an orphanage because the powers that be at the time believed I had a far better opportunity of surviving, of being educated and not ending up in gaol. That is as it was at that time. And, as I say, I am not saying this for any other reason than because it really upset me when people were calling these children `stolen children'.

          That was the way it was done in those days. If your parents could not care for you, the authorities came along, took you from your parents and put you into an orphanage. It was traumatic—there is no doubt about that. I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I do get a little bit upset about this. I spent the first year in the orphanage crying every night, as did most of the children there. So it is very traumatic. And I remember that my parents were crying when we left them. I spent five years in that situation.

          But, when you think about it, what was the alternative—you could not eat, you could not be educated, you could become a criminal, you could wander around the streets. It would be a tragedy if this was done based on the colour of someone's skin. But I must say that, in those days, it would have been better for me if I had been taken from my parents at an earlier age than 10, because then I could perhaps have had some loving family that would have adopted me, taken me in and given me all those things that young people should have.

They probably were in a situation where they could not provide those things that, in that time and age, people thought were needed for the upbringing of a child in the community. Do you blame the people who took those children away? That was the age and that was what they believed was the thing that had to be done to ensure a future for those children.

         —My fundamental accent in this budget contribution is the reality of representing a seat in western Sydney. Last weekend, the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         perhaps demonstrated the importance of this budget, because once again it
         <break page="5124" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          clearly gave a delineation of the growth of the inequity within Sydney, within regions and between suburbs. That of course followed articles in the past year or so which also went to the different levels of crime, burglaries, car thefts, et cetera, between the poorer western suburbs of Sydney and the more affluent areas. The comparative article they did earlier was about Baulkham Hills.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This budget fundamentally re&amp;hyphen;emphasises this trend. This basically condemns Australia to a drift towards private provision of public services. It indicates to us a future of isolated, entrenched, wealthier communities, perhaps reinforced by private police forces and security—a clear growth of concentration leading to ghettos of unemployment and ethnic concentrations within the western suburbs of Sydney. It reinforces a lack of interest in, and a lack of help for, the unemployed; and that is reinforced by their concentration in the demographics of Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not want to speak about other cities but certainly the demographics of Sydney show the reinforcement of that trend. In my own electorate, for instance, the Municipality of Auburn has unemployment levels of 22 per cent. Whilst Holroyd is significantly below that, and Parramatta is marginally lower still, they are well above the national trend. In this budget contribution I want to mention the decisions by Auburn Council and Parramatta Council at this stage to condemn the budget on a wide variety of aspects. I want to mention that it is politically significant that, on those two councils, only 10 of the 27 aldermen are members of the Labor Party or in any manner affiliated with it. I think that does indicate the wider concern about this budget in western Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to concentrate on two aspects of the budget. One of them is the question of the University of Western Sydney, the second largest employer in the whole of the western region after the electricity authority, and an institution which now takes 65 per cent of its students from the western region, where 40 per cent of Sydney's population and 10 per cent of the nation's population reside. It is worth noting that the monumental effort of the Labor Party in creating this university was well overdue. It followed decades of neglect by previous governments, and it followed the rather preposterous decision to site the previous new Sydney university at Ryde, convenient to car&amp;hyphen;owning North Shore residents and remote from public transport and from those areas in western Sydney where people are dependent upon private buses, which basically go every hour or so and which sometimes during the day have no service for three&amp;hyphen;hour breaks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The establishment of the University of Western Sydney was fundamentally important to the region. Significantly, one of the initiatives of this government is to attack access to education and thus to reinforce the reality we already have—one which Labor only partially tackled—of great inequities in access.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To demonstrate the requirement for that university in western Sydney, while the rest of Sydney offers 32 places per 1,000 inhabitants in tertiary institutions, western Sydney only offers eight—one&amp;hyphen;quarter of the scale of the rest of Sydney. The University of Western Sydney now takes the highest proportion of non&amp;hyphen;English speaking background students of any tertiary institution in Sydney. In the last six years it has had 25,000 graduates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some 58 per cent of the students who attend that institution are the first in their family to undertake tertiary education. It is also worth noting the university's interrelationship with the job question. Some 50 per cent of the graduates subsequently found employment in the western
        <break page="5125" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         region. The university has also made notable active affirmative efforts, with 50 per cent of its academic staff being females.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The university has done work in the ethics of organ transplants and donations, on water quality in the Hawkesbury&amp;hyphen;Nepean catchment around the seat of Lindsay, on violence in schools, and on juvenile correction centres. It has run hundreds of weekday and weekend courses to reinforce basic accessibility. There is certainly a need for the University of Western Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is disturbing that this government has attacked tertiary access to such an extent, because a variety of diverse studies in this country have indicated that there is a problem. A paper by Dev Mukherjee, published by the Australian Centre for Equity through Education, gives an overview of the articles and studies in this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The overview notes the 1987 article by Abbott&amp;hyphen;Chapman, `Dropping out or staying on?' The analysis there showed that certain postcode areas were associated with positive or negative retention patterns. In the 1985 article by Carpenter, `Passing on advantages from parents to children: some Australian data,' Carpenter noted significant differences in examination results between students from the upper white&amp;hyphen;collar class and those from the lower white&amp;hyphen;collar and working classes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Completing secondary school in Australia: a socio&amp;hyphen;economic and regional analysis
        </emphasis>
        , Mukherjee says that it reports that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Despite the clear link between socio&amp;hyphen;economic status and Year 12 completion rates the relationship was not linear or continuous. The lowest seven deciles showed little difference in completion rates but there was a large difference between this group and the highest three deciles.
       </para>
       <para>
        Power, in the 1984 article `Factors influencing retentivity and satisfaction with schooling,' noted that the average levels of parental education and parental encouragement were high in schools with high retention rates.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Beresford, in a 1993 article `The really hard cases,' concluded that socioeconomic disadvantage was a strong predictor of early school leaving and that multiple disadvantage is likely to include chronic truancy and/or school refusal, unemployment, offending, drug use and emotional disturbance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally—not in terms of the number of studies, but in terms of my time today on this matter—Mukherjee, citing the 1993 paper by Teese, McLean and Polesel entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       <para>
        Mukherjee has produced a significant study which goes to a large number of statistical works on this question. Yet what we are seeing in this budget is an attack upon the University of Western Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That attack has been answered by the Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellor. It has been answered by the entire institution. The reality of the government's policies is a lack of access for people in Lindsay, Greenway and Parramatta. The government has a phalanx of policies going in this direction. Those policies are in stark contrast to Labor's performance of a growth rate of 60 per cent in university enrolments for 17&amp;hyphen; to 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds.
       </para>
       <break page="5126" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this budget, the government seeks cuts of $1.8 billion in the forward estimates. It has massacred the rolling triennium. It has reduced public funding and a pronounced swing is going to occur now with regard to charging full fees. Already the figures are coming through from universities around this country that fewer people are enrolling because of the systematic attempt by this government to move towards fee charging, to move towards favouring the people who can afford to go to universities, and fundamentally at the end of the day to allow places for a larger number of overseas students, to the detriment of Australian students and, more particularly, to the detriment of people in western Sydney.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has, over a four&amp;hyphen;year period, reduced operating grants by $620 million&amp;hyphen;plus, compared to Labor's announced intention. It has, and this is just typical of a philosophical bent, a preoccupation with ideological issues, abolished discretionary funding of $215 million. The independently assessed quality assurance program noted that the outcomes of those discretionary funds for innovative programs were `overwhelmingly positive'. It talked of `significant improvements across the sector' and `a marked improvement in quality assurance policies and practices in teaching and learning,' and said it was `impressed by the magnitude and extent of attitudinal and procedural change in universities.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The very trenchant cutbacks in the actual degree of public funding of universities, and more particularly the impact that is going to have on the youth of Penrith, the youth of Parramatta and the youth of Granville, are the ways in which the government is giving a very clear signal to most working class and lower middle class children in this country that `unless your parents can afford to send you to university you will not be going.' As I said, the figures are coming through in this country at the moment. The figures are being answered by universities offering incentives to students to enrol because of the very dramatic downturn in enrolments at this stage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing the government has undertaken is to require from more students payments of their HECS. They have further directed it towards cost recovery—the user pays. They have at the same time hit students who do graduate with the threat that they will be paying back very quickly on levels of income lower than average weekly earnings. So what is the average person going to do in western Sydney, in Lindsay? They are going to question whether they are going to obtain a job out of this degree, they are going to question whether it is worth their while, they are going to question whether their parents can afford to send them there. There are clear indications from the Higher Education Council studies in this area over a long period of time that there will be a very direct impact with regard to lower socio&amp;hyphen;economic groupings and with regard to rural students. So here we have a very clear policy to deny access, to limit access to tertiary studies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="5127" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          The other matter I want to turn to is the question of employment. In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the budget one of the messages the government was trying to give was about the very heavy youth unemployment in this country. It conveniently ignored the reality that we are talking about a very different pool of unemployed youth than we were speaking about a decade ago. We cannot separate the skills, the accomplishment, the employability of these young people from the reality of higher retention rates in education. We are talking about a very different pool of people offering themselves to employers now than we were a decade ago. We are not comparing apples to apples when we say the youth unemployment rate in 1995 or, for that matter, in 2000, is the same as it was in 1980. We also have an international phenomenon that is going to affect Australia and the new Liberal government: it is the reality that international ly, unless you have skills, unless you have education, there are fewer and fewer jobs available to you.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the budget there was a very strong coalition emphasis on youth unemployment, a supposed offer of hope and many mock tears about its concerns with this issue. But what we have seen since the budget is a very real change of direction, a very real slap in the face for anyone concerned with employment, and there has been a diverse range of ways in which this is shown.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note that, in the Senate estimates in the last fortnight, even the Treasury has indicated the picture of retraction in the economy, the dire consequence of the government's cutback from expenditure, is going to be far worse. Although it is not mentioned in the budget papers, under questioning they have indicated that it is going to be worse in two years than it is in the first year. We also have in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         of 8 October an article by George Megalogenis which says:

         He further noted:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANZ figures have been considered a reliable indicator of future trends in the jobs market.

         The heading of that article said that the jobless figure might reach nine per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Reserve Bank's new Governor, Ian Macfarlane, has also assailed this remote possibility, this implausible theory, that if you force wages down low enough in this country, if you smash the unions firmly enough, if you reduce conditions in a wide enough spectrum then, at the end of the day, it will create employment in this country. I think we have seen the attempt in the United States by those who are the intellectual inspiration of these people to go down that way. The severe retraction of wages in America has had no correlation in employment growth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This budget does assail the unemployed in a very wide variety of measures. It takes the government to a large degree out of employment service provision. It says that only those people that have been unemployed and suffered long enough—for a year—will get essential services. It essentially goes to a pattern where those people who are viewed as unemployable, who have the most disabilities, will not be serviced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my electorate, the Granville CES office, which has been closed, is indicative of the historic pattern of assistance by the CES to unemployed people. It would have had 50 years of existence next year, through Labour and Liberal governments, but now it goes on the scrap heap—part of a pattern to deny assistance to young people. If there was any sincerity and interest by this government in employment beyond the theory of reducing wages in this country so we can compete with Indonesia and the Philippines, and we do not have to compete with Taiwan and Korea in the educated, highly paid part of the market, then they would not do one of the most harmful, most negative things possible. That is, to take away the $200 employment and education access help for unemployed people. How can they have any interest in unemployed people in this country if they deny them even that $200 payment to enter employment?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also have Alan Mitchell's comment on 2 September that bringing unemployment below eight per cent was going to be a lot harder than it looked. His analysis was that it will only fall to 8.1 per cent on the most realistic scenario. Of equal plausibility, quite frankly, is the
         <break page="5128" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          alternative that with growth of 3¼ per cent a year, the reality will be far worse. This contrasts with Labor's performance—not over six months, not over one year, but over a decade and more—of four per cent annual growth, an internationally creditable fall in unemployment from 11 to 8&amp;half; per cent, and a concurrent increase in total employment of three per cent a year. I would posit that this is genuinely more attractive than the performance under the previous Howard sojourn, of 10.7 per cent inflation, unemployment of 10 per cent and a deterioration in social wage expenditure of a massive 17.5 per cent, including the legendary refusal to pass on a CPI payment to the country's pensioners.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the budget performance is even more to be assailed for its hypocrisy and the assault it makes on those condemned to unemployment due to the government's policies. Over a four&amp;hyphen;year period, under the guise of concern that some labour market policies were not effective enough and under slogans of creating real jobs—whatever they are—the administration throws 30,000 public servants and their families on the scrap heap and, at the same time, slashes $1.8 billion over four years from employment programs in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         How can the Australian electorate possibly construe that they are sincere in being concerned with employment when they are cutting back nearly $2 billion in help, supposedly because some schemes do not work? If some schemes do not work, why don't you replace them with those that will operate, that will succeed? We know that Minister Vanstone, in attempts to cover up this attack on labour market programs, has been shown to have misled the parliament by indicating that, before the last elections, Labor had access to information indicating that it knew its target of five per cent was not possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Subsequently, it has been shown that the advice the government did receive before the election told it, from the growth patterns the previous government had had, that five per cent was quite possible, quite plausible, quite feasible. This government, indicative of its priorities, says, `Oh, targets are too hard; it is false.' That might be construed as having some validity if there were some interest, some activity, by the government. As I indicated previously, there is no activity; there is, in fact, the reality of a very big attack on unemployed people. It is interesting to note that the study of Skillshare by Access Economics shows clear evidence of that program's effectiveness in helping the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed through its ability to give that target group employment in a significant period after training.

       (1) On the 16 February 1996 a meeting was held between the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Brian Howe and the Premier of Western Australia, the Hon Richard Court. It was during this meeting that possible projects were briefly canvassed in light of a potential second phase of the Better Cities Program. The Kwinana public housing redevelopment and South West Transit project were amongst those discussed at that time. As the principles of a new phase of the program were yet to be put to Cabinet within a budget context it was agreed that State and Commonwealth officers should meet to identify a number of proposals likely to be consistent with the themes discussed. Commonwealth and State Officials subsequently met and jointly identified a further two projects, the North&amp;hyphen;East Corridor and the Perth Economic Gateway Study. A Steering Committee, chaired by the Western Australian Minister for Planning, the Hon Richard Lewis, and comprising representatives from Commonwealth, State and Local Governments, was formed to consider, prioritise and recommend suitable proposals. The four proposals aforementioned were recommended and further developed in tandem with the development of the wording for a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding. The Western Australian Minister endorsed these four projects for funding in correspondence to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) No. The Western Australian Government did not enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth in respect of the proposals referred to in part (1) before 27 January 1996. The Government is currently reviewing all of its administration and program expenditures with a view to achieving savings as a lead up to the August Budget. In this respect any funding for the 1996/97 financial year would therefore need to be considered in the context of that Budget and until its presentation to Parliament it is not appropriate to give any undertaking in regard to those monies.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) The Australian Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr Richard Starr, represented Australia at negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) Yes. Ambassador Starr played a key role in negotiating a true zero threshold comprehensive test ban treaty in the Conference on Disarmament. The Australian Government attaches a high priority to ensuring that Australia makes a practical and realistic contribution to disarmament and non&amp;hyphen;proliferation efforts. The Government has recently announced a successor to Ambassador Starr as Ambassador for Disarmament, who will be responsible for pursuing Australia's interests in the negotiation of arms control and disarmament agreements in the Conference on Disarmament, as well as other international fora.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) In a recent advisory opinion, the ICJ unanimously agreed that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (a) The Court was requested to give an advisory opinion, not a judgement. Advisory opinions delivered by the ICJ are not binding under international law. The Court itself has been explicit in stating that advisory opinions are just that—advisory—and have no binding force. However, advisory opinions are generally regarded as important judicial pronouncements on principles of international law.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (b) The Government remains fully committed to the twin goals of preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament, and will continue to focus on practical, realistic steps to achieve this. The recent adoption and opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, in which Australia played a major role, is an important step in the nuclear disarmament process.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (4) Australia was very concerned that time was running out for the international community to have a CTBT open for signature by September 1996, as had been called for unanimously by the UN General Assembly last year. That is why, when all avenues for consensus agreement on a CTBT text had been exhausted in the Conference on Disarmament, Australia acted promptly and initiated action which allowed the draft CTBT to be considered for adoption and opening for signature by the international community at the UN General Assembly.
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

      </para>

       (5) Yes.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (6) and (7) Australia's preferred position was that the CTBT enter into force simply after a certain number of countries had ratified the treaty. During the course of the negotiations we sought to promote that position with a range of countries, including the UK and Russia. Australia explored all possible avenues to secure a more flexible entry into force provision, but concluded that this was not possible. We recognise the importance, nonetheless, of as many countries as possible, especially the five nuclear weapon states, and the threshold states, signing and ratifying the treaty as soon as possible.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (8) India's current position that it will not sign the treaty means that the CTBT may not come into force for some time. The CTBT will nevertheless have an indispensable normative value even before entry into force. Signature of the treaty will constitute a political and moral commitment to renounce nuclear testing. There is also a principle of international law that a state which has signed a treaty is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty even before its entry into force. Each of the five nuclear weapon states—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China—signed the CTBT upon its opening for signature at the United Nations in New York on 24 September. By bringing nuclear testing to an end, the CTBT is a vital step in the nuclear disarmament process.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (9) Australia is urging nations to sign and ratify the CTBT as soon as possible. If the CTBT has not entered into force within three years of its opening for signature, there will be a Conference of States Parties to consider and decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law may be undertaken to accelerate the ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the treaty. This process will be repeated at subsequent anniversaries of the opening for signature of the treaty, until its entry into force.

       Among the most immediate tasks will be to work for the early commencement of substantive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (known as a "cut&amp;hyphen;off" convention). This is widely acknowledged as the next logical multilateral step after a CTBT and would be a major new addition to the process of nuclear disarmament and to strengthening barriers to nuclear proliferation.
