However, I would like to address a couple of the issues that were raised last night by Senator McKim—in particular, in relation to the responsibilities for state and territory police. My first point is to reinforce that the state and territory police are the first responders always, and they will remain the first responders, to any violence. Civilian law enforcement agencies remain paramount during any call-out. That has not changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in the bill are also aimed at making it easier for the ADF to assist the states and territories in responding to terrorist incidents, as we think it should. They will also ensure that the ADF has the powers it needs to assist police in quickly responding to such incidents. The states and territories will retain responsibility as first responders for domestic security incidents in their respective jurisdictions. In particular, I point out to colleagues that the amendments make it clear that, when operating under a call-out, the ADF must assist and cooperate with state and territory police forces. No ifs or buts: it must cooperate with the state and territory police forces. As far as reasonably practicable, and even after it has been called out, the ADF will not act unless formally requested to by the relevant state or territory police force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make a second point in relation to some of the issues that Senator McKim raised last night. The bill does contain a range of limitations and safeguards where the ADF is called out in response to domestic violence. These ensure that the exercise of any power under a call-out order is necessary, reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances. These limitations and safeguards operate at various levels, including at the ministerial level, the ADF command level and the level of individual ADF members. Again, I remind colleagues in this place that, at the ministerial level, authorising ministers may only call out the ADF after taking into account the nature of the violence and whether the ADF would be likely to enhance the state and territory response to that domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also imposes limitations on the way in which the CDF may utilise the ADF. The CDF must only utilise the ADF under a call-out order for the purposes specified in the order itself. The bill is explicit that the CDF must not utilise the ADF to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action except if there is a reasonable likelihood of either the death of, or serious injury to, persons or serious damage to property. Therefore, the ADF could not and would not, for example, be called out in response to nonviolent protests, industrial action or civil disobedience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the discussions that we had on the meaning of 'domestic violence' in this chamber last night, I would make a number of points. The bill defines the term 'domestic violence' in accordance with section 119 of the Constitution, and this has not changed from the current legislation. In fact, it's not possible to formally define in part IIIAAA what 'domestic violence' means under the Constitution because, as I'm sure Senator McKim would know, the terms in the Constitution cannot be defined or determined by ordinary legislation, such as that that is before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Only the courts can determine the meaning of the Constitution, and the High Court ultimately decides the meaning of the Constitution. And I will take that interjection from Senator McKim, because he might not like the fact that it is part of our Constitution and it is in accordance with our Constitution. As I said last night, Senator McKim, it is not simply about the 'vibe' of the definition; it is about what is in the Constitution and how the Constitution can and cannot be defined—in this case, within this piece of legislation. Further, it is critical that these terms be sufficiently flexible that they cover the range of significant violent incidents that may justify the call-out of the ADF to assist state and territory police. It is used in section 119 of our Constitution, and as—</span>

                    </a>  I'll just remind Senator McKim that this section deals with state requests for assistance in responding to domestic violence. In that context, it is clear we are not talking about incidents of violence which the police have well in hand. The incident must be of such gravity and magnitude that it warrants calling out the ADF.</span>

The amendments will ensure that the ADF is able to utilise these specialist skills and capabilities to contribute effectively to domestic counterterrorism efforts, as it should be and as we and the Labor Party agree it should be. I'm sure the vast majority of Australians would also agree that, in such an event, these ADF capabilities should be utilised to protect them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does recognise the need to reappraise legislative settings to ensure that the Commonwealth is best positioned to be agile and effective in the way it supports states' and territories' response to terrorism incidents. And, again, if you ask any Australian out in the street, they would say, 'Of course, if we are subject to a terrorist incident, we should have all available assets in Australia in response.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and also the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for their detailed consideration of this bill. This bill reflects the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that Australia's counterterrorism legislation framework remains robust and that the ADF can most readily enhance our law enforcement agencies' response to the evolving threat of terrorism.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  Minister, I listened very clearly to your arguments last night and this morning in relation to the term 'domestic violence'. You are right that it is in the Constitution, as I pointed out in my second reading contribution. You were very clear last night that the term was defined in the Constitution. That's actually not right, Minister. I think it would be better for the record if you would get up and admit that you were wrong last night when you said that the term 'domestic violence' was defined in the Constitution. It is not defined anywhere in the Constitution; it is simply mentioned in the Constitution. I think accuracy on the public record is important. But your argument today, as I understand it, is that it is not possible in this legislation to define the term 'domestic violence', because the term is also in the Constitution. To me, that seems to be a circular argument, and one that I don't accept. Are you saying, Minister, that no legislation in this country can define any word that is in the Constitution? Because if that's what you're saying, I don't accept it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be very clear: this is legislation to make it easier to put the Army onto the streets in Australia and potentially use lethal force against Australian citizens. That's what we are debating here today, and it is not good enough. It's not good enough for the government to come in here and say, 'We're only going to do this in circumstances of domestic violence,' and then not define that term in the legislation. You can put all the fluffy words you like in the explanatory memoranda, but the absolute safety net that the Australian people need is to have the term 'domestic violence' defined in this legislation so that the Australian people can understand in what circumstances ministers, including Minister Peter Dutton, will be able to call out the Army onto the streets in this country and potentially use lethal force against Australian citizens.</span>

However, I would just perhaps restate what I just said. I do acknowledge the term is not specifically defined in section 119—it is mentioned but not specifically defined. However, as I very clearly said earlier on, the term has a clearly understood meaning in this constitutional context and it is used in section 119 of the Constitution, as you have acknowledged, Senator McKim. This section very clearly deals with state requests for assistance in responding to domestic violence. In that context I will reiterate that it is clear we are not talking about any incidents of violence that the police have well in hand. The incident must be of such gravity and magnitude to warrant calling out the ADF. We might have a difference of opinion in terms of whether it should be—and, clearly, philosophically the Greens don't believe there is any circumstance in which the ADF can be called out in response to domestic violence, as stated in the Constitution and also as clearly defined through precedent.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  Firstly, let me clarify the Greens' view on this legislation for you, Minister. I thought I had made it pretty clear. We do not support lowering the threshold, in the way that this legislation proposes to do, to make it easier to call out the Army onto the streets in this country and potentially use lethal force against Australian citizens. It's also worth my placing on the record exactly what I said last night, because it was either deliberately or otherwise misrepresented by some coalition senators in the debate last night. What our second reading amendments were proposing was not that parliament needed to be recalled in order for the call-out order to be made. That is clearly not the effect of our second reading amendments. Our second reading amendments were to make it very clear that the Greens believe that if a call-out order is made, parliament should be recalled within six days, if it's not sitting already, and that when parliament—within those six days—is recalled, an instrument, which is a disallowable instrument, should be laid on the table justifying the reasons for the call-out. That doesn't relate to Australia going to war, which was the deliberate inaccurate conflation that was made by Senator Macdonald and others last night. It relates to call-out of the ADF within Australia. That is different from us going to war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' view on Australia going to war has been made abundantly clear for well over a decade now. We don't believe Australia should go to war without parliamentary approval—very simple, very basic, very easy. We do not believe that executive government, with no accountability whatsoever, ought to be able to make the decision to send our country to war and to send the men and women who serve in our Defence Force overseas to die and to kill other people without the parliament signing off on it. That's in relation to going to war. In relation to a call-out order, which is the matter covered in this legislation, we are not saying that parliament needs to endorse it before it's made but that, if one is made, parliament should be recalled within six days and should have the capacity to disallow that call-out order. That is the position of the Greens, and I want to place that clearly on the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to domestic violence, Minister, thank you for agreeing that it is not defined in the Constitution. I understand that terms in the Constitution are from time to time effectively defined by High Court decisions. I suspect most senators understand that. As you said this morning, it is the government's position that domestic violence refers to conduct that is marked by great physical force. You've placed on the record that things like peaceful protests, industrial action or civil disobedience would not fall within the definition of domestic violence but then you put a caveat on that this morning, Minister, where you said 'except where there is a significant risk of death or injury to people or significant property damage'. I don't have those words in front of me, because they are not in the explanatory memorandum anywhere I can understand, so this is a new addition to what the government says it regards the term of domestic violence as meaning. In this context can I be clear: would the government consider a call-out of the ADF simply to prevent significant damage to property that occurred as a result of peaceful protest, industrial action or civil disobedience?</span>

                    </a>  The first thing I can clarify for you is that the bill does not impact on the right of people to engage in peaceful protest, industrial action or civil disobedience. It is a fundamental precondition of a call-out order that domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur. The bill contains a range of limitations and safeguards where the ADF is called out in response to domestic violence. These ensure that the exercise of any power under a call-out order is necessary, reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances. These limitations and safeguards operate at multiple levels, including the ministerial level, the ADF command level and also the level of individual ADF members. At the ministerial level, authorising ministers may call out only after the ADF takes into account the nature of the violence and whether the ADF would be likely to enhance the state and territory response to that violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also imposes limitations on the way in which the CDF may utilise the ADF. The CDF may utilise the ADF under a call-out order only for the purposes specified in that order. The bill is explicit that the CDF must not utilise the ADF to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action except if there is a reasonable likelihood of either the death of or serious injury to persons or serious damage to property. Therefore the ADF could not and would not be called out in response to non-violent protests, industrial action or civil disobedience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There may be circumstances—for example, Senator McKim, where terrorists attack a peaceful protest or conduct an attack in the vicinity of a peaceful protest, which is again very consistent with the methodology of attacking crowded places—where ADF members may be exercising powers in the bill, such as establishing a cordon or directing people away from a location where there is violence, which could incidentally impact on the people engaged in peaceful protest; however, this would only be in a manner which is reasonable and necessary to protect the lives and safety of people from actors, such as terrorists, who are carrying out or likely to carry out attacks of violence. It's important to remember again that state and territory police would always be the first responders to such incidents.</span>

This is not hypothetical because paragraph 231A of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum accepts that the term 'domestic violence' is not defined in the bill and then goes on to attempt to define it by saying that the term 'refers to conduct that is marked by great physical force and would include a terrorist attack' and a few other things. Then it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Peaceful protests, industrial action or civil disobedience would not fall within the definition of 'domestic violence'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the addendum to the EM says, but then you're getting up in here today and saying that, if there is a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property, actually civil disobedience can fall within the definition of 'domestic violence'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about calling the Army out to potentially use lethal force against Australian citizens. I think you have to be very clear about the circumstances under which that can occur. You've now put in your speech an addition to what is in the explanatory memorandum. Quite frankly, I have no certainty in my mind about what 'domestic violence' means, because you have failed to define it in this legislation. I do not accept your argument that, just because a term is used in the Constitution, it can't be legislatively defined within the context of a particular piece of legislation. That is a circular Sir Humphrey argument that I don't accept. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger point here is that you're asking the Senate to pass this legislation and you are adding to the addendum to the explanatory memorandum on the fly in this place and are completely changing the meaning of the explanatory memorandum, which says that civil disobedience would not fall within the definition of 'domestic violence'. You're now telling us that it could fall within the definition of 'domestic violence' as long as there is a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So again I ask the question you didn't answer when you were last on your feet: is it the situation that, should this legislation pass, the Australian Defence Force will be able to be called out onto the streets in response to an event of civil disobedience if there is a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property? It is a yes or no question.</span>

The definition of domestic violence has not changed in this legislation and it certainly hasn't changed in terms of our understanding under the constitutional definition. It requires violence. It requires extreme violence. You might be shaking your head, Senate McKim; however, as I have said a couple of times already, in this context, it is clear we are not talking about incidents of violence which the police have well in hand. The incident must be of such gravity and magnitude to warrant calling out the ADF. Again, the definition of domestic violence hasn't changed. But in this legislation we are saying there has to be a request from the state or territory police force. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be of assistance to Senator McKim, in light of his questions, if I just remind those in this chamber of what the actual threshold for call-out of the ADF is. The current threshold for call-out requires the authorising ministers to be satisfied that a state and territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect itself or the Commonwealth interests from domestic violence. This threshold means that the Commonwealth would not call out the ADF, under part IIIAAA, where the Commonwealth assesses that a state or territory has both the capability and capacity to resolve the incident. But this threshold limits the ADF's ability to complement or augment a civil law enforcement response to a terrorism incident. So these amendments will replace the threshold requirement that the states and territories are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or the Commonwealth's interests against domestic violence. Instead, under this legislation, when deciding whether the ADF should be called out, authorising ministers will need to take into account the nature of the violence and whether the ADF will be likely to enhance the state and territory response. The amendment will allow greater flexibility for the ADF to provide the most rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support to the states and territories upon their request for such an incident. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I think if you ask any Australian on the streets, 'If these incidents occur, should the ADF be called out where they have specialist capabilities to assist state and territory police?' the overwhelming answer would be, 'Of course we want them to be able to help if there was a domestic terrorist incident.' In finishing the answer to this question, I will just say: the call-out of the ADF will continue to be an exceptional event.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  Minister, expanding on Senator McKim's line of questioning, and maybe to assist in clarifying things, I note you were talking about hypotheticals; all laws in this chamber affect matters into the future. I have checked the standing orders. There is nothing in them to fetter—like there would be at estimates—the answering of a question that's hypothetical; in some sense, they all have to be. The question is about the future operation of the law. To go to the matter that was raised, I think you sort of walked back from the idea that the ADF would be called out to a protest, even in circumstances where there was a risk of damage to property or there was a risk of damage even to life. Based on our past experience of seeing protests play out, some of them violent, in most instances—in fact, in all instances I can think of—the police were able to handle those sorts of affairs. Is that fair? You've talked about the fact that there is a threshold requirement. I can't imagine a civil event that would meet that threshold requirement that you've just talked about.</span>

I agree with you wholeheartedly, and I think the government agrees with you wholeheartedly, that for civil protests or civil disobedience that are peaceful and that are within the remit and capabilities of state and territory police to deal with, well, of course they wouldn't even seek the ADF assistance for that. But, again, as I've reinforced several times here this morning, we are talking about domestic violence as it is mentioned in section 119 of the Constitution, and that, as I've reiterated several times here already, is for extreme violence which goes beyond, or is likely to go beyond, the remit of state and territory police to deal with—in particular, in relation to terrorist acts.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Minister, the issue I have here is that you've just, in an attempt to assist the Senate to understand the term 'domestic violence', talked about extreme violence. That's not what the explanatory memorandum says. That says 'great physical force'. You might think those terms are interchangeable. I actually don't. I think one sets a different threshold to the other. This goes back to the problem that I articulated in my speech on the second reading yesterday: you haven't defined the term 'domestic violence'. Every time we ask you about it, the words you use to attempt to define domestic violence change. If I were a High Court judge looking through this debate to try to find out what the government's intentions were around this legislation, I think you would have already provided me with three or four different forms of words in an attempt to indicate to the Senate what you mean by domestic violence. This is the danger when you refuse to define these terms in the legislation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a dog's breakfast of a debate, and it's now a dog's breakfast of a piece of legislation. I am astounded that the Senate is about to vote this through on the third reading. I'm so concerned about this that we are going to divide against this on the third reading so that the Australian people can absolutely know that the Greens had nothing to do with this dog's breakfast of a piece of legislation that fails to define the terms under which the Army can be called out to kill Australians. This is an extraordinary morning in the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what I'd like to ask you, Minister. This question isn't about the government's intent. This is about what would be possible should this legislation pass. I want to ask you this: would it be possible for a call-out order to be made to address civil disobedience with a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property? Would it be possible, if this legislation passes, that a call-out order could be made to address a circumstance of civil disobedience where there is a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property? Is that possible or not?</span>

First of all, the answer is, no, if the damage is within the capability of the state or territory police to deal with. However, if it has escalated or is very likely to escalate far beyond what the state or territory police can deal with, in that case—similar to Senator Patrick's point—it would be a magnitude of civil disobedience or violent protest that we probably haven't seen here in Australia, certainly in my lifetime. If it got to that threshold point, then the answer would be, yes, states or territories could ask the ADF for assistance. But, again, that doesn't mean that the ADF would—through the safeguards that we've mentioned—actually agree to do it. It would depend on the circumstances.</span>

Isn't that the current standard? Doesn't this bill lower the threshold significantly? The current standard is: where state or territory police forces are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence. That's the current standard. The new standard that you're inserting with this legislation is: whether ADF support will be likely to enhance the state or territory's capacity to protect itself or Commonwealth interests. Could you just clarify that, please?</span>

Given your response, I'll reframe my fundamental question slightly, because I think it's just so important that people understand under what circumstances it is possible for the Army to be called out onto our streets. So my question is this: if this legislation passes, could a call-out order be made to address a situation of civil disobedience where there is a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property if that call-out would enhance the capacity of the state or territory police force to deal with the situation?</span>

Again, the answer is no, it wouldn't, if it were still within the capability of state and territory police to deal with. But if it were beyond the capability of state and territory police to deal with and they sought assistance, then the answer is yes, it could be. It is not necessarily the case that it would be triggered because, again, it would be subject to the same safeguards that I've already gone through.</span>

I say that genuinely, and I do appreciate that. I'll set out where I think we've got to, and I'll just put it in the terms that I think you've just used. I know that, if I've got it wrong, you'll stand up and tell me, and I'll give you the opportunity to do that. My understanding is that, if this legislation passes, we'll have a situation in this country where a call-out order can be made to put, for example, the Army on the streets within Australia in a situation where there is civil disobedience and a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property, if it is beyond the capacity of a state and territory police force to deal with and if they request such a call-out. Is my understanding correct?</span>

So, if there is violence—for example, death, serious injury or serious damage to property—and it is extreme violence that is beyond the capability of state and territory police law enforcement to deal with, then the answer would be yes, they could make that request to the federal government. But it doesn't mean it would be authorised and it certainly doesn't mean that the safeguards that I've already gone through would be nullified, because they are still valid.</span>

In the same scenario, if this legislation passes, could a call-out order be made to put the Army onto the streets in, say, my home state of Tasmania if there were a situation of civil disobedience and a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property, if Tasmania Police requested it and if it would enhance the capacity of Tasmania Police to deal with that situation? What I've done there is lowered the bar compared with my first question, where the parameter was 'if that situation were beyond the capacity of Tasmania Police to deal with'. Instead I'm asking: if the deployment of the ADF would simply enhance Tasmania Police's capacity to deal with the situation—and if all of those other circumstances pertained—could a call-out order be made?</span>

In that scenario where a peaceful demonstration or civil disobedience has turned violent—for example, people could be rampaging through the streets of Hobart—and violent damage is likely to be done and the crowd is out of the control of the ability of, in that case, the state police to deal with, then, of course under that circumstance, the state police can make a request to the Commonwealth. However, at the Commonwealth level, there would still need to be consideration of whether it should be called, and that, again, will depend on the circumstances.</span>

I say this not as a criticism of the intelligence services, but sometimes they do get it wrong; sometimes their intelligence is flawed. I also raised the prospect that a call-out could be, in some sense, motivated or biased by political considerations for political advantage. That's not directed necessarily at your government, but perhaps at a future government. Could you explain to me the oversight mechanisms that are in place: once a call-out has occurred, what ability does the parliament have to scrutinise that call-out at a future date?</span>

Contingent call-out orders may be made as part of ADF security assistance for major events—for example, recently, at the Commonwealth Games or the G20. You can make contingent orders where there is a prospect of terrorism or serious violence. Contingent call-out orders pre-authorise the ADF to respond, should specified circumstances arise. That's why it's called a contingent order. They are routinely made to protect major events from air threats in particular. These amendments will also now allow the ADF to be pre-authorised to respond to land and maritime based threats when operating under a contingent call-out order.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  That raises another very good question—and one of great interest, I think, to all in this chamber—and that relates to parliamentary scrutiny. I know that that's something that you're particularly interested in. I can advise you that the government acknowledges that calling out the ADF to assist state and territory police in responding to domestic incidents is an extremely significant act, and it is important that the parliament is given an opportunity to review the operation and conduct of the ADF under a call-out order. Consistent with the existing legislation, this bill preserves the parliament's oversight role in relation to call-outs under part IIIAAA. The bill does require the minister to present the following to parliament: any call-out order that has ceased to be in force; and any specified area declarations that relate to the order; and also, the minister must report any utilisation of the ADF that occurred under that order, including the number of premises searched in specified areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also advise you that, where a specified area declaration has been made, the bill also requires the authorising ministers to table in the parliament a statement that says these three things. First of all, the statement must summarise the content of the call-out order to which the declaration relates. It also must state that a specified area declaration has been made, and it must describe the specified area and its boundaries. These provisions ensure that the parliament is informed of an operation and the scope of orders and declarations that are made under part IIIAAA and, to the extent possible, the ADF's role in resolving the incident as well. The documents must be presented to parliament within seven days of the cessation of a call-out order. Given the urgency of any circumstances that justify the call-out of the ADF, the government believes it is appropriate that the parliament be given the details of the ADF's conduct after the incident has been resolved. To do otherwise would risk diverting critical resources away from operations.</span>

So, in actual fact, the parliament will be made aware of a great deal of detail about the call-out. But in terms of the decision-making process—we're talking about what deliberations took place and what input was provided to those deliberations—clearly, the parliament can ask questions of ministers about that, or perhaps call an inquiry, for example. In relation to things like intelligence information, where that may have been fundamental to the decision to call-out, or mixed in with other aspects, such as political aspects, it could have been a failure of intelligence. Once again, no disrespect to the intelligence services. Sometimes those mistakes are made and are unavoidable. Noting there are understandable restrictions on conducting inquiry about those sorts of matters in a public forum like this chamber, is there any provision for the PJCIS to examine a call-out in detail? Does the current legislation, namely the Intelligence Services Act, which prevents the reviewing of operational oversight or perhaps intelligence related matters, prevent that?</span>

It's an arm of the executive, residing within PM&amp;C. Obviously, the inspector-general has great powers—standing royal commission powers—to examine the intelligence services, but her jurisdiction may not cover some aspects of these sorts of operations. So, once again, if it's possible, maybe on notice, to look at the interaction between the IGIS and this act in respect of her jurisdiction?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note, as I indicated in my second reading speech, that I think the Governor-General is not simply a rubber stamp in this: he has to be satisfied as to advice. In response to a question I asked at a recent estimates, the Official Secretary to the Governor-General indicated that General Cosgrove has not been involved in any exercises of call-out. I of course note that General Cosgrove is a former Chief of Defence Force and a former Chief of Army. Now that you are in some sense lowering the threshold and so increasing the possibility of call-out, what measures is the government putting in place to make sure that command structure is practised, not just with the Governor-General but in circumstances where the Governor-General is not available—it might be a case of a state governor. I'm wondering what your contingencies and plans are to make sure that the exercise of call-out decision-making will be conducted into the future.</span>

I'll take most of what you said there as commentary, not so much as a question. But I can confirm that this legislation makes no changes at all to the Governor-General's responsibilities. Yes, you are right—you're testing my knowledge, going back to exercise Mercury 04. However, what I can say is that the bill has been delayed in commencement for six months to allow for a series of exercises to occur between federal and state agencies to make sure that they are trained and that they understand the operation of these new provisions. In relation to the Governor-General, while I can't tell you the outcomes of the 2004 exercise, I can tell you that the Governor-General is fully briefed on the arrangements for authorising call-out of the ADF under section IIIAAA of the Defence Act, including the Governor-General's role, which, as I confirm, has not changed under this legislation.</span>

The burden of my question goes to the government's plans to make sure not so much that the states are exercised or that the federal-state interaction is exercised but more so that alternative arrangements are practised out into the future.</span>

I just want to warn the Australian people that something sinister and dangerous is about to occur in this parliament. This parliament, because of the policy lockstep of the LNP and the ALP, is about to pass legislation that makes it much more likely that the Army will be deployed onto Australian streets, with authority to use lethal force against Australian citizens in circumstances that are completely inadequately defined in this legislation. We are sleepwalking in this country down a dangerous path towards authoritarianism, and this bill will add to the over 200 pieces of legislation that have passed through state, territory and Commonwealth parliaments in the last 20 years that remove or erode the country's fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties that we used to send Australian Defence Force personnel overseas to fight wars to protect and defend.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  A primary role of our parliament is to make, monitor and update laws which have a key focus on the safety of Australians. Our parliament has a strong record of bipartisanship when it comes to dealing with legislation surrounding national security measures and other laws that go to making our communities safer. The opposition extends the same hand of bipartisanship when it comes to legislation relating to road safety and motor vehicle standards. During the calendar year of 2017 there were 1,224 road deaths in Australia and more than 35,000 seriously injured on our roads. In 2018 alone there have been 874 deaths on Australian roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, thanks to the actions of this current government, Australia no longer builds cars and must rely on imports. With nearly 1.2 million new cars sold in this country each year, we must ensure that the standards applying to motor vehicle imports are up to date and fit for purpose, especially with the rate of deaths on our roads, which I mentioned earlier. We must not dumb our cars down. With the annual economic cost of road crashes in Australia at approximately $30 billion per year, it is essential that governments do everything they can to ensure that cars being brought into this country are the safest they can be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is therefore timely. It is 17 years since the Motor Vehicles Standards Act and its regulations were last reviewed. This package seeks to bring the regulatory regime into the 21st century and to make it more streamlined, reducing compliance costs to the industry by approximately $68 million. The legislation will create an online register which will provide consumers an opportunity to check that the vehicles they are interested in purchasing comply with Australian design standards. Despite having some concerns about the finer details of these bills, based on consultation with stakeholders, Labor will support this package. We believe that the stakeholder concerns, which I will address shortly, should be taken into account in the rules and subsequent technical and administrative arrangements provided for by these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The road safety package will replace the old Motor Vehicle Standards Act, which regulates imported vehicles, and includes five pieces of legislation: the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—General) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Customs) Bill 2018 and the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Excise) Bill 2018. Under existing rules, people demonstrate that a vehicle complies with safety standards using the physical attachment of a compliance plate, but this legislation replaces that system by creating a register of approved vehicles that comply with Australian standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be two ways for a vehicle to make its way onto this register. The first, known as the type approval pathway, is for new vehicles being imported into this nation for sale. The vast majority of vehicles will enter the list via this route. The second, known as the concessional pathway, is aimed at a limited range of new and used vehicles which can be granted concessions on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. This pathway will apply to specialist and enthusiast vehicles, classic and vintage vehicles, and vehicles that have a special purpose that could not be fulfilled if they had to comply with Australian standards. This latter category might apply to emergency vehicles and cranes. The legislation creates the specialist and enthusiast vehicle register to ensure that motor enthusiasts seeking to import unusual vehicles can do so without breaching Australian vehicle standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation establishes road vehicle standard rules to define vehicles that are of general, specialist and enthusiast nature through needing to meet one of six criteria: high-performance vehicles, vehicles with environmental standards significantly superior to Australian mainstream vehicles, vehicles manufactured with modifications to assist people with a disability, rare vehicles, left-hand drive vehicles, and campervans and motorhomes not originally manufactured as campervans or motorhomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also includes provisions allowing for the importation of vehicles for purposes other than road use, such as for testing or racing. These vehicles will not be listed on the register. Relevant states and territories will decide whether such vehicles may be driven on roads within their borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes will serve the interests of consumers. Consumers will be able to search the online register of approved vehicles using their vehicle identification number, VIN, to confirm that vehicles they want to buy comply with the rules. The new legislation will also require manufacturers to introduce a secure identification-marking requirement for all new vehicles. This provision is designed to provide a deterrent to vehicle theft and rebirthing. This is a sensible move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package also gives the minister for transport the ability to issue a recall notice on any road vehicle or road vehicle component and lays out the framework for voluntary recalls. This too is important. When manufacturers discover faults in motor vehicles, it's critical that there is a process by which they can be recalled quickly if they represent a risk to public safety. There have been some major safety recalls in recent years involving major manufacturers. We need a simple system that allows for efficient handling of such issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Administration of these new standards will be funded by industry participants on a cost-recovery basis. However, these bills do not outline the amounts to be charged. These will be prescribed in accompanying rules and regulations that will be subject to disallowance by this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Various industry groups have expressed concern over elements of the package. For example, the legislation allows some vehicles to be imported through a revised Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme which allows for the import of used specialist and enthusiast vehicles. It also creates a New Low Volume Scheme which applies to new vehicles where fewer than 100 vehicles are to be imported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association raised concern about the inclusion of the New Low Volume Scheme under RAWS. The AAAA argued that, under the existing system, vehicles imported under the New Low Volume Scheme do not need to be individually inspected. Its concern is that, under the new system, low-volume imports will have to be individually inspected and that this will add costs to the industry. The AAAA suggested that the new arrangements would therefore disadvantage small workshops and benefit big manufacturers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns were also expressed regarding the effect of this legislation on companies that import vehicles from overseas and then convert them into campervans or motorhomes. Specifically, this legislation closes a loophole in the existing system that allowed some registered automotive workshops to import thousands of cars which they did not convert but simply on-sold at profit. This legislation's closure of that loophole has created concerns about the prospects of companies that do legitimately convert vehicles into campervans and motorhomes. Having considered these concerns, Labor has formed the view that the legislation as it stands serves the public interest. However, we take these industry concerns seriously. The opposition will monitor the operation of the legislation and the operations of its accompanying rules and subsequent technical and administrative arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Administration of vehicle standards is never easy. When we are importing 1.2 million cars into our country per year, we need to make sure that we get it right. We need a system that is simple but one that also allows people who want to import unusual and specialist vehicles an opportunity to do so. While I think there is still more we can be doing to mandate sufficient safety ratings on cars we import into our nation, this legislation includes some important improvements in the cause of public safety and security. I commend the package to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I'm rising today to speak to the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and associated bills. These bills replace the Motor Vehicle Standards Act—legislation that's provided the basis for the safety, environmental quality and anti-theft performance of all vehicles on Australian roads. The Motor Vehicle Standards Act dates to 1989, although it has been amended along the way. However, the last major review was undertaken over 17 years ago. It's easy to understand why the Motor Vehicle Standards Act needs replacing when you think about how far vehicle technology has come in the last three decades, particularly when it comes to safety and reducing pollution. It's only since 2013 that Euro 5 standards have applied in Australia, and that was the first set of standards that put a restriction on the amount of particulate matter that came out of petrol engines, and it's only since 2011 that electronic stability control has been mandatory on all new cars, reducing the danger of skidding. Technology moves on and legislation has to keep pace. However, we know that Australia is way behind when it comes to next-generation technology, including our dire position on electric vehicles compared to the rest of the world, but I'll come to that in a bit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills will establish a new legislative framework for the regulation of the importation and supply of road vehicles and the provision of some road-vehicle components. We think the changes to the import pathways are sensible with the streamlining into two distinct groups—registered approved vehicles and registered specialist and enthusiast vehicles—which will make the system easier to navigate for both new vehicle retailers and the broader automotive community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens certainly welcome the new recall powers, streamlining the process through which the government can act on and enforce recall events if they're required for safety reasons or if specific models do not comply with the national road vehicle standards. This is an important addition to the powers of the minister, as the Takata airbag event can give testament to. However, I would note that there are concerns that the Greens have with this legislation. As noted in both the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report, the powers delegated to the minister are extremely broad. This is a trend which is concerningly becoming the norm for this place. As parliament is squeezed out, decisions are being made by the executive and less and less space is being left for parliamentary oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the record that the bills that we are finally debating today are the outcome of nearly five years of process within the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. There was consultation in 2013, a second consultation process began in 2014 and, finally, a bill made it to the parliament in 2016, but here we are, and it's 2018, so it's been two years since the bill first made it to the parliament. The original version of the bill had a more permissive pathway for the import of right-hand-drive vehicles from overseas, but the minister at the time folded after a deluge of industry pushback, and now we see in the bill before us today that those provisions have been substantially tightened. It's very interesting to think about the five-year process and the pressures that are applied during such a process, because right now we are looking at a very similar process and similar outcomes with the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions. Since that body was set up in October 2015—that is, three years ago—we have had nothing but delay after delay after delay. We've had multiple changes of responsible minister, multiple rounds of discussion papers and draft regulatory impact statements and a continuous pushback in the time lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposals that the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions have actually developed are quite good, even if they're not always as ambitious as us Greens would like. The proposed light-vehicle efficiency standard would finally implement something that 80 per cent of cars around the world already have to comply with, and that means more efficient vehicles and more efficient use of fuel. It would save up to $1,000 for the average driver at today's fuel prices. And it would reduce greenhouse gas pollution by over 65 million tonnes between now and 2030, which would be a big—although still insufficient—dent in our growing transport sector emissions, and those transport sector emissions are significant. Our transport pollution is now 18 per cent of our total emissions, and it's growing—it's the fastest-growing sector in the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ministerial forum also recommended that we immediately begin the introduction of Euro 6 standards for light vehicles and trucks, putting tighter caps on particulate matter and nitrous oxide pollution, which kills literally hundreds of Australians per year. These standards have been in place in many other countries since 2014. Pollution from those heavy vehicles is incredibly significant, and it really needs to be tackled. I say this as someone who lives in Footscray, in the inner western suburbs of Melbourne, just across from the port, where massive semitrailers and B-doubles are plying our streets every day, belching out their diesel pollution—past schools, past kindergartens, past hospitals. The Euro 6 standards would put a reduction on this diesel pollution and, in doing so, would reduce rates of cancer, because diesel is a known carcinogen. Every time you've got a vehicle that is belching out those diesel particulates, you are doing damage to people's health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sorts of reforms that have been recommended in the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions are very similar to the road vehicle standards being considered in this bill. They are simple, sensible, bare-minimum standards. But, again, we've finally got to this stage with the Road Vehicle Standards Bill and the implementation of the recommendations of the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions—these critical updates to our motor vehicle regulation—and industry is calling the shots. In July last year, after beginning consultation on an actual implementation model for the changes that the forum is recommending, we saw a front-page article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph </span>about a carbon tax on cars. Ministers Frydenberg and Fletcher immediately went into damage control. Their plans were immediately shelved, and the whole thing went away for another year. Could anybody be surprised that the story in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph </span>appeared literally the day after consultation on the implementation model began? No: it's what we would expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know from documents acquired by Senator Patrick through freedom of information that, in February of this year, Ministers Frydenberg and Fletcher had further discussions from which there were consequential actions for officials from the Department of the Environment and Energy to carry out. We were even told, when we asked questions about it in estimates in May this year, to expect something on vehicle emissions later this year. Well, there's not much of this year to go, is there? But of course after that we heard negative stories all over Sky TV, 2GB and the Murdoch press. If hope was held out that Ministers Frydenberg and Fletcher would be able to get it together on a third try, it's been pretty clear since the events of August—and the complete abandonment by this government of anything that even looks like doing anything meaningful about climate change—that those reforms are dead and buried. It's taken five years for us to get the Road Vehicle Standards Bill to this stage today, it's taken us three years so far in the ministerial forum, and I don't think they are going to be achieved within this term of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, here we are. We welcome this bill, and we welcome the amendments that are going to be moved by Senator Storer, which will ease the pathway to the import of electric vehicles. If we don't have the efficiency standards recommended by the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions, then at least being allowed to have imports of second-hand electric vehicles would provide another pathway to help build the base of vehicles on Australian roads so that we could begin the journey towards electric vehicles being the majority of the vehicles on our roads. So many other countries around the world are so far ahead of us in doing that. So many countries around the world now have regulations in place so that all new vehicles being sold will be electric vehicles by 2030, by 2040, by 2050, yet here in Australia we are lagging behind. So at least, as a stopgap measure to get more electric vehicles on the roads, allowing the importation of second-hand electric vehicles, with appropriate consumer protections in place, is a very sensible way forward.</span>

I think it's worth concluding my speech today by actually reading you out the text of that second reading amendment in full, because it summarises our concerns with the current situation regarding pollution from vehicles and the sorts of legislation that we would like to see—legislation about safety and the sustainability of vehicles on our roads; legislation that should be being introduced, in addition to the measures being introduced in this bill. So I move my second reading amendment:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="275424" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STORER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  The Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and four other related bills replace the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to implement the federal government's updated framework to regulate how motor vehicles are made available to the Australian market for the first time. The government is seeking to ensure that Australians enjoy a car fleet that is safe and displays suitable environmental performance, with adequate consumer safeguards and choice. This concludes the consultation process with the automotive sector, which has taken four years. It cements the government's approach to managing vehicle entrants to Australia's fleet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, this bill and its accompanying regulatory framework define how motor vehicles are imported into Australia and given permission to enter the register of approved vehicles. The first and main way that this may occur is via the type approval pathway; the second is the concessional entry pathway. A type approval is the permission given by the government to car manufacturers to bring a compliant vehicle to market. This is the primary path. In 2018, 98 per cent of the 1.2 million vehicles that entered Australia came to market this way. The second means of vehicle entry to the Australian market is the concessional path. This allows the importation of new and used vehicles that were not made available via the type approval pathway, under highly restricted circumstances. These vehicles comprise less than two per cent of vehicles entering Australia for the first time. This legislation provides for the regulatory oversight of these two pathways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the second concessional pathway, these vehicles that have not been made available to the market must comply with the criteria set out in the Register of Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicles, the SEV register. The draft rules explain the range of vehicles that may be released to market under this scheme, to include mobility and environmental vehicles. This is a positive since it will have the effect of expanding consumer choice and forcing car manufacturers to release a wide range of models to what they consider to be a small and distant market. However, we now have an opportunity to do more when it comes to electric vehicles, an issue I've advocated on since joining the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's uptake of electric vehicles, EVs, has been slow compared to the rest of the developed world. Of the approximately 17 million light passenger vehicles in Australia, only around 7,300 are EVs. In 2017, around 2,300 electric vehicles were sold in Australia, representing just 0.2 per cent of the market. As the Chair of the Select Committee on Electric Vehicles, I've heard a wealth of evidence on why it is in our interests to increase the uptake of EVs here in Australia. They stand to improve our health, our environment, our economy and even our national security. The slow uptake of EVs in Australia can be partly explained by a lack of model availability, higher up-front purchase prices and poor consumer familiarity with new technology. These are all factors that would be assisted through a deeper and more diverse second-hand electric vehicle market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealand provides a useful comparative case study. Our neighbour has around 2,000 more EVs on the road than we do, despite having a population smaller than Sydney. This is largely thanks to policy decisions it has made around the importation of second-hand EVs from larger markets, which have resulted in greater range and affordability. To take a real-world example, there are currently 250 Nissan LEAFs for sale online in New Zealand. It's possible to buy a 2012 model for around $12,185. In Australia, by comparison, a search shows that just 14 Nissan LEAFs are available, with all but two priced over $20,000. The BMW i3 is another example. Twenty-eight are available online in New Zealand, and just five are available here in Australia. A 2015 BMW i3 may be purchased in Australia for $41,000 with 48,800 kilometres on the clock. The same model is available in New Zealand for the lesser amount of $37,000 with just 2,500 kilometres on the clock. These are examples of the significant premium the Australian motoring public pays compared to New Zealand and are a consequence of the supply constraints that limit Australia's market. This is why it is a shame that the government missed this opportunity to increase the liquidity and competitiveness of Australia's second-hand EV market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My proposed amendment rectifies that. It inserts an additional clause that requires the accompanying rules in this legislation to provide for the inclusion onto the SEV register of previously approved electric vehicles—that is, electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids that have entered Australia via the main type approval pathway but have had their type approval expire, which generally happens five years after the approval comes into force. This will allow independent importers to bring in second-hand EVs from comparable markets, increasing the depth of Australia's EV market. For clarity, this reform would mean that, from next year, second-hand EVs built in 2014 and earlier could start being imported into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a modest but highly significant amendment that would benefit Australian consumers and assist us in meeting our Paris agreement commitments. I'm advised that it could initially lead to an additional sale of around 3,000 electric vehicles per annum. These vehicles would be a way for the Australian market to test its appetite for EVs and could lead to stronger sales of new vehicles of this class. It would also encourage car manufacturers to offer more competitive pricing and a wider range of stock for new EVs here in Australia. If car manufacturers choose not to do so, independent importers could fill the market gap quite quickly. This suggestion would result in an increased supply of electric vehicles in Australia at a far more affordable price, without requiring subsidies from the taxpayer. Some may claim that such independent imports will place consumers at risk. While I understand these concerns, I believe they could easily be addressed with the right regulations. For example, importers should be required to meet all Australian consumer obligations around warranties, recalls and insurance, and arrange for the vehicles to be inspected by a registered authority, approved to inspect imported vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I call upon the government and the opposition to accept this modest but significant amendment. It will result in more electric vehicles coming to market, providing more choice and lower prices for Australian consumers and improving our health, environment and national security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This second reading amendment that I will be moving to the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 seeks to highlight the need to relax current restrictions on the importation of second-hand vehicles. Current import restrictions were originally put in place to help protect our domestic vehicle manufacturing industry but, since both the government and the opposition have decided that we don't need one, these restrictions are now redundant. All that these restrictions now serve to do is to push up the cost of private transport to Aussie battlers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the 2014 review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, the Australian government engaged Castalia Strategic Advisors to evaluate the costs and benefits relating to the potential relaxation of the current vehicle import policy settings. The report identifies significant economic opportunities for reducing the current restrictions on the importation of used vehicles. In its conclusion, the Castalia review stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Deregulating the used import trade has the potential to unlock considerable economic net benefits. The economic analysis shows that the benefits outweigh the costs of deregulating the used import trade by … (up to) $1,943 million in NPV terms.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whether the biggest impact is to increase the fleet size, to substitute for new car sales or increase the scrappage rate of old cars, the benefits outweigh the costs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact is that relaxing import restrictions on late model second-hand cars and commercials would increase the supply in Australia, increasing competition amongst sellers and driving down prices. That means that people who struggle to buy and maintain a car today could then afford one. This is a direct and immediate improvement to the living standards of many hundreds of thousands of Australian working families who currently struggle to afford a reliable car. The only opponents of this measure are the new vehicle dealers, who see an increase in their supply of good, reliable second-hand cars as a threat to their own profits. Well, I say that the government isn't here to protect the profits of a minority at the expense of everyone else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Japan, strict emission controls mean that car engines struggle to remain compliant after 30,000 or so kilometres. This means that there are ample late model cars which could be exported to countries such as Australia, facilitated by the fact that the Japanese drive on the same side of the road as us and so no vehicle steering conversions are required. Widespread importation of second-hand cars from the UK is also available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of its inquiry into Australia's late automotive manufacturing industry, the Productivity Commission recommended that the government should relax the restrictions on importation of second-hand passenger and light commercial vehicles. So, if the government refuses to support the amendment I will be moving, it not only will be ignoring the economic benefits identified by its own independent inquiry but also will be rejecting the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. It is also rejecting the best interests of ordinary working families. So I call on the government and the Senate to adopt the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and the Castalia review and make reliable car ownership affordable for Australian working families.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals and Minister for Regional Services, Sport, Local Government and Decentralisation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I'd like to firstly thank all senators for their contribution to this debate on the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and related bills. This legislation delivers on five key principles that improve the regulation of road vehicle standards for the benefit of the Australian community: flexibility and responsiveness, given how fast the motor vehicle is already changing and how fast it's expected to continue to change; clarity, so that we reflect modern legal drafting standards to strengthen the existing regulatory framework, whilst improving transparency and decision-making; a greater choice of road vehicles for Australians; ensuring modern compliance and enforcement powers, improving safety and emission outcomes; and the continued harmonisation of Australian standards with international standards—a longstanding policy of Australian governments to reduce the regulatory impost on Australian industry and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australian manufacturers and importers of full-volume vehicles, these bills mean reduced red tape and streamlined certification processes. I recently met with the Caravan Industry Association of Australia, who are amongst the strongest advocates for this legislation, which will level the playing field for our Australian manufacturers. A strong Australian caravan industry means safer caravans, safer roads, improved consumer confidence and more jobs in manufacturing and tourism, particularly out in the regions, as more and more Australians with their caravans head outside capital cities to experience our fabulous beaches, mountains and country towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australian motoring enthusiasts, these bills mean that an increased range of specialist and enthusiast vehicles will become available and there will be reduced costs of regulatory compliance. This legislation will see, for example, people able to import and supply new and used electric vehicles that manufacturers have, for whatever reason, chosen not to provide to Australian consumers. This results in greater choice for Australian consumers but will not result in parallel imports of electric vehicles, ensuring protections for consumers wishing to use this pathway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Australian community at large, these bills mean a better regulatory system capable of responding to the challenges of the future. They mean improved compliance with safety and environmental standards. Ultimately, these bills mean safer, cleaner and more secure vehicles for Australia. I commend the bills to the Senate.</span>

Does the Prime Minister agree with Minister O'Dwyer when she blames the ideological warriors within the Liberal Party for the government's horror result in the Victorian election? </span>

As I already informed the Senate yesterday, the Prime Minister had a very good meeting with his Victorian colleagues, as you would expect, after the election in Victoria on the weekend, where the team very constructively reviewed the results and, of course, assessed the lessons to be learnt to ensure that moving forward we continue to improve our performance. Of course, I completely reject the assertion that Senator Collins quoted. </span>

A, Liberal senator Jane Hume, who blamed the government's failure to properly fund Australian schools; B, Liberal members for Dunkley and La Trobe, Chris Crewther and Jason Wood, who blamed the government's failure on infrastructure policy; C, Liberal member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson, who blamed the government's failure on energy policy; or, D, all of the above?

When we, the Morrison government, say we back small and family business, we put in place the policies that show exactly that. There is a well-known saying: cashflow is king. Well, cashflow is well and truly king for small and family businesses. In fact, it is crucial to their ongoing prosperity and growth. As I travel around Australia, so many small and family businesses say to me that, when they do not get paid or their payments get delayed, it affects their viability to operate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that small and family businesses are the backbone of our economy. We also believe that they should not have to wait months and months to get paid for work that they have already completed. The millions and millions of small and family businesses around Australia deserve to know that the businesses they engage with are paying them on time so that they can have the cashflow they need to get on with business. Disappointingly, a number of large companies in Australia take advantage of small businesses and subject them to unreasonable and unfair payment times. We say enough is enough. No big business in Australia should be allowed to use small and family businesses as a bank. We as a government have taken some action. We are, of course, leading by example: the government has committed to paying all contracts up to $1 million within 20 days commencing on 1 July 2019. We're also now going to require large businesses with a turnover in excess of $100 million and government agencies—you need to lead by example—to publish payment information on how they engage with small business. Cashflow is king, and small and family businesses deserve to have that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Why? There are in excess of 3.3 million small and family businesses in Australia who employ approximately seven million Australians. They, of course, are the key to Australia's economic success. The success of small businesses is one of the key reasons that, under the Liberal-National government, we have seen almost 1.2 million jobs created since we were elected to office in 2013. As I've said, when small and family businesses prosper and grow, so does the Australian economy. That is why, day after day, you will see policy announcements. Whether it is lowering their tax down to 25 per cent or extending the instant asset write-off, we will always put in place policies that back the small and family businesses of Australia.</span>

Those on the other side don't seem to understand that a business that has to close employs no-one. In fact, as we often say, the closest those on the other side have ever come to a business is to proudly close it down. Well, shame on them, because, when you close down a business, that means Australians lose their jobs. Up until recently, those on the other side actually promised to increase the taxes that small and family businesses pay in Australia. They needed to be dragged kicking and screaming to the right side of the chamber to support our plan, the Morrison government's plan, to lower the taxes that small and medium businesses in Australia pay. Why? We know that the more money that a small family business has, the more it's able to invest in that business, grow that business and employ more Australians.</span>

The now Independent member for Chisholm, Julia Banks, says that those who deposed Mr Turnbull acted 'undeniably for themselves, for their position in the party, their power and their personal ambition, not for the Australian people who we represent, not for what people voted for in the 2016 election, not for stability'. Why did those who made Mr Morrison the Prime Minister put their power and personal ambition before the Australian people they represent?</span>

Every single person on our side of the parliament is motivated by one thing and one thing only, and that is doing the right thing by the Australian people. We are focused on providing good government, having inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position from Labor. Having inherited an absolutely disastrous and deteriorating budget position, we've worked hard over the last five years to ensure that today the economy is stronger, employment growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is well below where it was anticipated it would be and indeed the budget position is stronger and improving to the point where we can now pay to help ensure patients across Australia can access affordable, high-quality medicines.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's something that Labor had stopped being able to afford because the then Treasurer and the then finance minister made such a mess of the budget that, in the 11 weeks from Labor's last budget to the 2013 election, guess what happened to the budget bottom line? There was a $33 billion deterioration in the budget bottom line in 11 weeks—$3 billion a week! Guess what happened in 2017-18? The budget position improved by $19.3 billion compared to budget. On the basis of what? On the basis of stronger economic growth, on the basis of stronger employment growth and on the basis of more Australians paying personal income tax because they got a job. Under our strengthening economy, there were fewer Australians claiming welfare, because they got a job under our economic plan for a stronger economy and more jobs. We'll put our economic and fiscal performance up against yours any day.</span>

The events of the last week of August are well understood. They are a matter of public record. The former Prime Minister lost the confidence of the party room. The party room elected a new leadership team of Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, and we are working very hard as a government—the Morrison Liberal-National government—to deliver for the Australian people. We are getting on with the job of doing the right thing by the Australian people. The Labor Party continues to play politics.</span>

Let me tell you what we are achieving for the Australian people. Under Labor, fewer and fewer people were able to find a job, and more and more people were ending up unemployed. We are actually delivering more jobs and a lower unemployment rate, and guess what: wages growth is actually picking up. Wages growth is picking up. We inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position from the terrible team over there, the economic and fiscal vandals over there, who reduced the opportunity for Australians to get ahead, and guess what: if Bill Shorten ever were selected to Prime Minister, this antibusiness—</span>

Yesterday the Prime Minister used his role of leader of this country to bag out young people, to criticise the thousands of young people who will be going on strike to call for urgent climate action. He said among other things that these issues can be dealt with outside of school. If the Prime Minister really takes climate change seriously, why did he so patronisingly dismiss the very real concerns of those who will live with the effect of climate change the longest?</span>

I think the basic proposition that most reasonable people would agree with—those of us who care about future opportunity for young Australians—is that kids should be at school. I don't think that there is anything out of the ordinary in the proposition that kids should be at school in order to prepare them for a successful life in Australia into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:27</span>):  My question is to Senator Scullion, representing the Minister for Health. This week the ABC and Fairfax started issuing a series of reports called 'The Implant Files' as part of a collective effort by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. It uncovered concerning information about the lax domestic and international regulation of medical devices and the devastating impact of this on Australian patients. We've all learned that the US FDA has allowed 4,600 medical devices to be approved for export only. These are devices that it refuses to approve for use in Americans but that are exported for use in Australia and other countries without having any mandatory postmarket surveillance. Why does the TGA in Australia allow devices that the US FDA has not approved for its domestic use to be imported and implanted in Australian patients?</span>

Patient safety is the Australian government's highest priority. Before any medicines or medical devices can be supplied in Australia, irrespective of whether they've been certified or otherwise in other countries, they have to go through an extensive assessment and meet the highest levels of safety and quality. They're also monitored once they're on the market. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is regarded as one of the most thorough of all agencies around the world and has the highest standards of assessment for both medicines and medical devices. But there is always a level of risk associated with any medical procedure or device. Companies are required by law to report safety issues and adverse events to the TGA. The TGA will monitor ongoing safety and performance of devices that are on the market, and if issues arise the TGA will issue safety alerts, mandate changes to the product or recall the product from the market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the recent media, and I have read much of it. The Minister for Health has tasked the head of the TGA, Professor John Skerritt, to review all of the claims made in the media regarding the regulation of medical devices and to provide advice to government on whether further safety measures are necessary.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />As I indicated earlier in my answer, we have to go through an extensive assessment to ensure we're meeting the highest levels. We don't provide a rubber-stamp approval for any medical device for use in Australia just because it has been approved overseas. Part of your question was: 'It hasn't been approved in the United States, and it's now being used here.' I'll certainly check that, because I don't understand that to be the case. It's a question I asked earlier today. Our regulatory framework— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What I understand to be the case is that there is no device or medicine that is available in Australia that hasn't gone through the TGA approval process. You assert that that's not an approval process that you think is appropriate, so I'll be very sure to ensure that I provide an answer to your question on notice around the alleged paper process rather than an expert process. But I have been informed that there are a number of people, including Australia's Chief Medical Officer, who were involved in ensuring that the colleges of the practitioners are able to ensure that we're moving to mandatory reporting of any adverse effects. So we've talked, I suppose, in your questions and my answers, about approvals from the TGA, but that isn't in regard to a very important process about the actual practitioners responding— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're in favour of all of those energy sources which help us ensure that we can (1) keep the lights on and (2) deliver reliable energy supplies in a way that is affordable—that is competitively priced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, under Labor, the experiment of an excessive Renewable Energy Target has been tried, by the South Australian state Labor government. And guess what? They couldn't keep the lights on. That is one of the reasons why prices across the National Electricity Market have been pushed up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pursuing reforms to energy policy which will help bring down electricity prices and ensure reliable energy supplies into the future, because that is very important. That is very important for families around Australia. It's very important for our competitiveness as an internationally competitive economy. We understand that for Labor all of this is a game. They're not even listening to the answer. We also know that Bill Shorten, if he were elected Prime Minister, would bring back a carbon tax, a carbon tax which would push up the cost of electricity, which would harm the economy, which would put jobs at risk and which would hurt families around Australia wanting to get ahead. </span>

The facts are that coal, by any reasonable projection, is going to continue to be a very important energy source for Australia to keep our economy strong and to ensure that Australians can have affordable access to reliable energy supplies. Guess what else? Coal will also continue to be a very important export earner for Australia. We understand that the Labor Party in Queensland is somewhat schizophrenic when it comes to these matters. They don't quite know. It is another wibble-wobble. We've got the Queensland Labor coal wibble-wobble. Don't come and ask us hypocritical questions, when we know that none other than Dr Brown once was on the record as saying how coal is a really important energy source which should be favoured ahead of hydro.

We support renewables as part of our technology-neutral energy mix. We know that under Bill Shorten there will be a war on aspirational families across Australia with more than $200 billion in higher taxes, which will lead to less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, and on the back of higher unemployment lower wages. Under Bill Shorten's antibusiness, high-taxing, politics-of-envy agenda, Australia will be weaker, and Australians will be poorer. They'll earn less and have to pay more. </span>

It was our government that sealed the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. In doing so we have seen a supercharging of the Australian economic relationship with China. This was on show very clearly in Shanghai at the China International Import Expo last month. Australian businesses were there at that expo in force. Indeed, Australia was in the top three in terms of countries for products exhibited at this major event hosted by China. We stood there alongside Japan and Korea, having the largest single presence at this expo in product presence. Significant businesses have enjoyed great success, such as the Tasmanian business Bellamy's Organic. There was a strong presence across apparel, accessories and consumers goods in some business areas, medical equipment and medical care products, services including education—all different businesses representing the different streams of Australia's rich and deep economic relationship with China. Whilst there I was pleased to witness the signing of almost a dozen MOUs worth around $15 billion in terms of Australia's continued economic relationship with China. Blackmores, ANZ, Tourism Australia in partnership with China Eastern Airlines, Austrade in partnership with Suning—all of them demonstrating that we have even further to go in terms of strengthening and growing the Australia-China relationship. And it is not just the economic ties; the people-to-people ties are being strengthened as a result of this partnership too. In the year to March, 1.4 million Chinese visitors came to Australia and 185,000 Chinese students studied in Australia—great signals for the strength of this relationship into the future.</span>

Industry has opened up trade, seeing some 22 per cent growth in two-way trade last year. Our exports of wine, milk powder and skin-care products more than doubled. Our nickel exports more than quadrupled. Exports of lobster and table grapes grew eightfold. All of this translates into economic opportunities for Australian businesses and employment opportunities that secure the prosperity of Australian families.</span>

The Murray Basin Rail Project to standardise the rail network and connect regional and metropolitan Victoria will create 280 jobs and has already cost taxpayers $440 million. Why has the Maroona-Portland line not been made a priority for a project of this scale? All you need, I am told, is to upgrade the sleepers. That seems like a piece of cake. Do you acknowledge that a failure to build the Maroona-Portland line will mean many Victorian farmers, growers, exporters and producers are locked out of the benefits of this rail project?</span>

I do think the re-election of the Daniel Andrews government was an appalling result for regional Victoria, particularly when you look at the infrastructure spend by that state Labor government in areas across regional Victoria, in our home state. And you know, as I do, that those areas outside of metropolitan Melbourne have been derelict when it comes to the Andrews Labor government's infrastructure spend. That is why the proposition that the state opposition put forward around the fast rail program—around appropriately funding not just fast rail but adequate rail and freight systems out to productive areas of regional Australia—was supported by voters last Saturday. They actually voted for that vision, overwhelmingly, with five out of seven National Party candidates and, indeed, many Liberal regional Victorian candidates, not seeing the swings. Regional Victoria did not rush to the Daniel Andrews agenda in the same way that Melburnians did. In terms of the specifics of the project you mentioned, Senator Hinch, I will take that on notice and get back to you after I've spoken to the Deputy Prime Minister, but I think that when we look at what regional Victorians care about—the promotion of agriculture, the assuredness around investing in regional schools and regional hospitals, nurses, and the like—Daniel Andrews and his appalling government's track record was wholeheartedly rejected by regional Victoria on Saturday. </span>

If you want to drop your completely irresponsible pursuit of an excessive renewable energy target then we're all ears. If you want to work with us in relation to a sensible, appropriately balanced energy policy framework which helps to facilitate investment to increase energy supplies and which helps bring electricity prices down, we are all ears. Bill Shorten was never prepared to do it. Bill Shorten was never prepared to constructively engage with former Prime Minister Turnbull when he did pursue the National Energy Guarantee. The opportunity was there for Mr Shorten, but, of course, Mr Shorten chose to do what he always does: he played politics; he put his perceived political self-interest ahead of the national interest. That's what Mr Shorten did, and he's still playing politics. Our focus is on doing the right thing by Australians, our focus is on doing the right thing by Australian families, and our focus is on bringing electricity prices down and making sure that we continue to keep the lights on and provide reliable energy supplies—and doing so in a way that is environmentally as efficient as possible. </span>

Our government knows that a strong national economy doesn't just happen by accident; it takes discipline, careful planning and a willingness to back small, medium and large businesses to create jobs. And, because we believe in these things, we can take decisions as a government when and where we can and after careful consideration to help stimulate local regional economies. That's why the Liberal-National government has been investing a record $75 billion in infrastructure and delivering essential services, such as telecommunications, health and education to support growth across regional Australia, and that is why we've also developed a strategic and targeted decentralisation agenda.</span>

I find it interesting that the party of Whitlam, the party of the Prime Minister who backed decentralisation in the seventies in a way that the minister responsible in your opposition won't do, seek to actually critique moving jobs into regional communities where it makes sense to do so. Not only will it stimulate local economies but, as the acting CEO of AMSA said: 'I'm an ex-mariner. There aren't many ships and there aren't many boats in Canberra. It makes sense for us as an authority to be located on the ground, serving those communities which we seek to as public servants, and it makes absolutely policy sense.' It was an absolute privilege to announce that last week.</span>

We know it's supported by people living in our congested cities and it's also, importantly, supported by those who live out in regional Australia. It brings new ideas and new faces into our communities and, importantly, brings new wages to stimulate local economies, more kids to our schools and more local volunteers to our CFAs, because we know that the public servants who head to our regional capitals and beyond are welcomed by those communities. But, importantly, part of our decentralisation agenda as a government isn't just about shifting public servant jobs out to the regions; it's about actually ensuring that the private sector avails itself of the advantages of operating out in the regions. It makes policy sense to place those public servants where the impact of their decisions will be most keenly felt. It makes economic sense and policy sense and it's core business for our government.</span>

Unfortunately, it would seem that Gough Whitlam's party, the former party for decentralisation, is absolutely turning its back on advocating for moving public sector jobs out into the regions—even out to Albury-Wodonga. We as a government want the benefit of a strong national economy. It shouldn't be restricted to just those in our major cities; it should be felt right across our nation. Under our government, we've been able to grow that, with over 1,100 jobs delivered into the regions. The announcement last week of the jobs from AMSA out to Coffs Harbour, down to Hobart, up into Darwin and to Geraldton and beyond is just the start. We have a plan to grow our regions. Someone mentioned earlier the APVMA. The APVMA received nearly 300 job applications for up to 50 positions. That is in demand. They are spoilt for choice for scientists who want to shift to Armidale.</span>

So I presume that I can respond in kind. I presume that that is the threshold which Senator Cameron has set. So let's talk about Mr Morrison and the message that Mr Morrison will deliver to the Australian community in the coming weeks and months, working up to the budget that he has announced for April of next year. He will advise the Australian community that Australia's economy is growing at 3.4 per cent, more strongly than at any time since 2012, which was, of course, during the height of the mining boom. He'll advise Australians that the economy is growing at a stronger rate than the world's seven largest advanced economies—the USA, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, UK and Japan—and the OECD average. And, because Mr Morrison is from the fine state of New South Wales, he is always welcome in that fine state. He will talk about the commitment which we have kept in relation to ensuring one million new jobs were delivered by this government after 2013, which was delivered ahead of schedule.</span>

We have a record $75 billion being invested over the next decade in highway upgrades; congestion-busting roads; rail projects, including the Inland Rail; improved local roads and a new airport in Western Sydney, which will be a game changer for the Western Sydney economy and, in fact, for the economy of Australia. The roads investment: Senator Cameron tries to avoid it, but he knows those roads. Northern Road, Bringelly Road, the developments around Elizabeth Drive, the development of the Western Sydney Airport—he knows them all. This government is delivering those, and those opposite are doing nothing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Both he and probably everyone else in this room will acknowledge that supporting all Australians into an opportunity for a job is probably one of the most important things we can do. The Community Development Program is a government remote employment service that works with all jobseekers in remote Australia to provide training, engagement, work experience—the sort of support they need to transition into work. The Community Development Program is working to deliver jobs that remote Australia needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the introduction of the Community Development Program, remote jobseekers have been supported into more than 27,607 jobs. Most importantly, more than 9,300 of those jobs have lasted for six months. Why is that important? The data show that, if you're there for six months, 82 per cent of you will be in a job two years later. It's really important; it's long-term employment. That's the evidence. This is absolutely our priority. If you've got a community where adults are engaged in training, whether it's work experience or increasingly in work, it's a much healthier community, rather than one that's plagued by the misery of passive welfare. That's what I see when I visit remote communities. That's what leaders like Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Noel Pearson, Roy Ah-See, Sammy Bush Banasi and Susan Murphy have called for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I agree, and I've been talking to many of you in this place, that there is much more to do. We need to generate more jobs. I'm very proud of the success of Indigenous businesses in winning contracts under our Indigenous Procurement Policy. We're supporting states and territories not only to introduce their own procurement policies but to make sure there are local Indigenous employment targets as part of that. This is part of our record infrastructure rollout. We have also announced the introduction of 6,000 subsidised job packages in remote Australia. This is going to boost opportunities for every jobseeker. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In the thousand new Indigenous businesses winning over a billion dollars worth of contracts in the IPP, they've got an Indigenous workforce, unsurprisingly, of over 50 per cent. Given that Indigenous Australians are three per cent of the population, you expect the average workforce to be around that. But they are at 50 per cent. That means that the more we back Indigenous small business, the more Indigenous jobseekers we're getting into work who are actually contributing to their own lives and their own economy. As we support all Australian small businesses with a more competitive tax rate so they can keep more of their own money, that applies equally to Indigenous businesses. It gets more small-business activity and even more jobseekers into work. That's what we believe on this side of this chamber—more runs on the board.</span>

I wish to clarify that, while there have been no major incidents off Australia's southern coastline, Australia has had one offshore well blowout, which resulted in the Montara oil spill in the Timor Sea in 2009.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really think Australians deserve better than this government. When the government becomes an absolute national laughing-stock, it's about time that it goes to an election and gives the people of Australia a choice—a choice between the current government and stability under a Labor government that is actually developing the policies that are important to Australians: policies on health, policies on education, policies on housing, policies on homelessness and policies that benefit working people in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a laughing-stock of a government—a government that has gone through a number of so-called economic policies. It started off with an austerity budget that would have meant pensioners in this country would have been $80 a week worse off over a decade. It wanted young people in this country to have access to not one cent of government support for a period of six months. It cut family tax benefit A. It cut family tax benefit B. It just took a wrecking ball to the basis of decency in this country, and after five years it has now been relegated to an absolute laughing-stock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Prime Minister with no agenda on the environment, who backflips on what he says constantly and who the media are now describing as a fake. This is a government in absolute disarray. This is a government that is divided. It's self-obsessed. It's completely out of touch. Its own members concede that the government is falling apart. Now the latest defector from this rabble of a government, the member for Chisholm, Julia Banks, who was subject to bullying and intimidation by her colleagues in the Liberal Party, says that there were Liberals 'trading their vote for a leadership change in exchange for their individual promotion, preselection endorsements or silence'. What has it come to when the government of the country is simply being driven by ideologues on the other side who are only about their own individual promotion or preselection endorsement?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that just does not meet the definition of government, because its members can't govern themselves, and when you can't govern yourself you can't govern the country. When you become a laughing-stock, as this rabble of a government has become, confidence declines. We have had a situation where we have not been in a position to reduce electricity prices in this country, because that would require some certainty in terms of policy from the government. We see this mob going from one policy to another, and it's being driven by the extremists in the coalition. It's being driven by the climate change deniers. It's being driven by the ideologues who only think about themselves and don't think about what's right and proper for this country. They are too busy carving each other up and knifing each other in the back. We learnt our lesson on these issues, and I would have thought any sensible government would have learnt their lesson. For Prime Minister Morrison to compare himself with the newly re-elected Premier in Victoria is just a joke. He is not anywhere near the capacity and the position— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  It's not often that one would agree with Senator Cameron, but, when he described himself and the Labor Party caucus as 'lobotomised zombies', he got it right.

                  </a>  The Labor Party are continuing to interject. They assert that somehow we are the bullies, yet their behaviour clearly displays how they behave—not only in this place but, of course, even more so, behind closed doors.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact is that every party, from time to time, has its difficulties. Today, for us, it was the Liberal member for Chisholm. But a member who rejoices in the surname of Husic might bring the Labor Party back to the ground. We all have these situations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And do you know what? The Australian people aren't actually interested. What they are interested in is: who has created employment and opportunity?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when Senator Cameron talks about the Liberals putting a wrecking ball through decency, is he talking about the 1.1 million Australians who have been taken off the scrap heap of unemployment and placed into the opportunities that are provided by employment? The Labor Party are silent. They cannot believe that, on that which we promised in 2013, which they laughed at, which they scorned, which they ridiculed—that we would create, within the first five years, one million jobs—we came in earlier than the five years with those one million jobs. Why? Because we created the economic certainty—something that the Australian Labor Party could never do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home state, 8.1 per cent was the unemployment rate when Mr Shorten was finally dismissed as the minister for so-called employment and workplace relations, in the then Rudd government, by the people of Australia—8.1 per cent. Today, it is well below six per cent, if I've got it correct, at 5.6 per cent. That is a transformation for thousands of my fellow Tasmanians who today have a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we have fewer people dependent on welfare than we've had for, I think, about 25 years. That is transformational. That is what true decency in a society is all about. It's not all the hyperbole and socialist rhetoric; it is the delivering of jobs—the providing of certainty and capacity to individuals to run their own lives. That is what we concentrate on whilst the Australian Labor Party play their games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What other things have we done? We've not only created these job opportunities; we've also ensured, for example, that, on the migration front, we have rejected the UN compact on migration. Where does Labor stand on that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have rejected paying $400 million to the International Climate Fund. Where does Labor stand on that—more indebtedness to an International Climate Fund? And where would we be borrowing the money from? Undoubtedly, from China. Who wants to reach into this International Climate Fund? China. So we'd borrow money from China to pay into the climate fund, so that they can get it, so we can then repay China, with interest. This is the ALP economic model. And so the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, whilst there may have been some untidiness on the government's side—as there has been on the opposition's side—what I would say to my fellow Australians is: don't judge the Labor Party on their rhetoric; judge them on their record. Judge us on our record, and the 1.1 million jobs speak for themselves.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  I was thinking that the remarks of Kelly O'Dwyer, the Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, may have been a little unfair when she said in the Liberals' crisis meeting last night that the Liberals are now viewed as homophobic, anti women, and climate change deniers, but then Senator Abetz got up and made a contribution, and I realised she had absolutely nailed it, because I think we all know the kinds of people in her own party that she's actually talking about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a day in the Liberal Party and what a day in Canberra. As I was coming down to Canberra on Sunday for this sitting week, I thought to myself, 'Well, I know for sure that the government is going to have some kind of debacle over the course of the next week.' I just wasn't sure what it would be. I didn't have to wait long. I only had to wait a couple of days to see what the debacle of this sitting week would be. Then again, I suppose the week is still early. We might see more. Just in one day, what we've seen from the government is the former foreign minister, Julie Bishop, out in the media saying that the government should agree to a national energy guarantee and should reach an agreement with the Labor Party on energy policy, in exactly the way that we have attempted to reach an agreement with this government for the last two or three years. So Julie Bishop has heard the message out of the Victorian election and knows that people want to see some action on climate change from her government. We also read this morning that, under the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, the government was about to introduce a national integrity commission. Of course, he was then deposed and the idea of an integrity commission was deposed with him. That was all before we got to morning tea, and then we didn't have long to wait before we saw the spectacular resignation of the member for Chisholm, Julia Banks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julia Banks absolutely crucified her party with the things that she had to say about them. She pointed to the fact that they have completely lost touch with what the people of Australia want to see from their government and have become completely obsessed with themselves. She also very much pointed the finger at the 'reactionary and regressive right wing' of her party—those are her words—who talk to themselves rather than listen to the people of Australia. So, whether it be Julie Bishop on the one hand, whether it be nobbling a national integrity commission on the other or whether it be the resignation of the member for Chisholm, Julia Banks, this government is in even more disarray than it was this time yesterday. And that really is saying something. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Haven't coalition senators had a good day responding to all of these incidents? First we saw one of them quoted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> as saying—excuse my language—'the effing place is falling apart'. I think that's a pretty accurate summary of the way this government is operating. Then during question time I noticed on Twitter that one coalition senator texted Alice Workman from BuzzFeed, telling her, 'I hope you're enjoying the dying days of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government.' I don't say this to gloat, because I think all Australians are absolutely dismayed by what they see from their government day in, day out here in Canberra. The truth is that this is a government that has stopped governing. They have stopped listening to what the people of Australia want to see from their government, and all they can do is fight amongst themselves, text journalists, speak to journalists about how embarrassed they are by their own government, all the time ignoring what it is that Australians want to see from them. The losers from this government's disarray are Australians themselves, and, as a senator from Queensland, I'm particularly concerned about what's happening to Queenslanders under this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know for a fact that what Queenslanders want from this government is secure jobs and wages that are increasing. Instead, they get more casualisation, more labour hire and wages that are barely growing—the lowest we've ever seen on record. What Queenslanders want to see from this government is well-funded schools and hospitals. Instead, what they get are more and more cuts to schools and hospitals. Queenslanders want to see more investment in their TAFEs, in their training organisations and in their universities to make sure both young people and older mature-age workers get the skills that they need to be able to compete for the jobs in the future. What do they get from this government? Again, they get cuts to TAFE, cuts to training and cuts to universities. What Queenslanders want to see is a fair taxation system where millionaires and big business do pay their fair share. But what they get from this government is attempts to reduce the tax burden on the top end of town. This government is so divided and so distracted that it has completely lost touch with what Queenslanders and Australians want to see. The sooner we get to an election, the better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  There can be no denying that, when there are state and federal elections, the results of those state and federal elections cause political parties, members of parliament, candidates and party organisations to take a very, very hard look at themselves. There's no doubt that the Victorian state election results for the coalition over the weekend have given us a very fresh opportunity to revisit the way that we are approaching our issues and to revisit the way we're engaging with the Australian community, but that happens to all parties and it happens over time. So my caution to Labor senators on the other side is: don't get too cocky, because you will fall over yourself. There are some important lessons for the Liberal Party in the Victorian state election result, but, in the first instance, I will trust the attitudes and opinions and perceptions of Victorian Liberals before a Western Australian senator like myself will comment on what's happened in Victoria. But it is a unique opportunity for the Liberal Party to take a hard look at itself before we go into the next federal election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, Senator Cormann gave the Labor opposition in the Senate a wonderful opportunity to come back into the Australian Senate today and ask questions about the economic performance of the government. Yesterday, Senator Cormann shared with the Senate what the OECD and the IMF had been saying about the performance of the Australian economy. Why is that important? Because that is the single most important issue that is confronting Australian families. What do their future employment opportunities look like, what do their future growth opportunities look like and how are they going to raise their families and ensure that their children and grandchildren have employment opportunities into the future? But, no, Labor senators today couldn't risk the opportunity to talk politics, play politics and focus on issues that are so far away from the minds of ordinary Australian families and small-business owners; so far away from the minds of Australian families in my home state of Western Australia, in New South Wales and in the Northern Territory. These are the issues that are top of mind to Australian families and small businesses: what does the economic future of our country look like? It is as simple as that. That is not an alternative government on the other side of the Senate chamber. Those people want to play politics—petty-minded politics—when, in fact, when you leave Canberra, the issues that are important to Australian families beyond here are much bigger and more significant than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do they not want to talk about the Australian economy? Why would Labor senators not want to ask Senator Cormann and other economic ministers about the Australian economy? The answer to that is: Paul Keating. What Senator Cormann shared with the Australian Senate yesterday was what Paul Keating had to say about Bill Shorten. Let's be very, very clear about this: if there is a Labor government, it will not look like the Hawke and Keating governments; it will be a dangerous Labor government. I'll come to that in one moment. What did Paul Keating say about Bill Shorten and the Labor Party? He said that Labor has 'lost the ability to speak aspirationally to people and to fashion policies to meet those aspirations'. That's what Keating said. No-one knows the Australian Labor Party better in this country than Paul Keating, and he said that Labor has 'lost the ability to speak aspirationally to people and to fashion policies to meet those aspirations'. Why would Paul Keating say that? Paul Keating says that because he knows that Labor has no plan for growth. You have a plan for taxes—you have a plan for taxes on retirees, you have a plan for taxes on families and you have a plan for taxes on small businesses—but you have no plan for growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australian families and Australian small businesses come out of the summer holidays next year, they're going to be presented with a very stark choice, and on that point alone Senator Cameron was absolutely right. Australians will have a very stark and clear choice—a choice between employment growth and economic growth, delivered by a coalition government led by Scott Morrison, or a plan for taxes and no growth, which will impoverish Australian families and small businesses.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. So said Winston Churchill, and he was paraphrasing a philosopher from the previous century. You might have thought that the Wentworth by-election would have presented an opportunity to learn something from history, because after the Wentworth by-election they all piled on—all of those conservatives, all of those people in the hard right—didn't they? Despite the fact that voters came to the polling booths wanting to talk about climate change, wanting to talk about the cuts to the ABC and the attacks on the ABC, wanting to talk about our international obligations and wanting to talk about a fair and decent Australia, the conservatives in the Liberal Party learnt nothing from that election. They went away and they determined that what they would do is double down. They would continue with the race baiting, the culture wars and the petty internecine feuds within the Liberal Party that are all about dragging that organisation over into a part of Australian politics that barely has a base, so extreme is it. That was their lesson. There was no teachable moment at the Wentworth by-election for this crowd. They just decided to double down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've had another opportunity presented to them in Victoria on the weekend. This same set of nasty, mean-spirited, small-minded attitudes was on display throughout the entirety of the Victorian campaign, and those attitudes were utterly repudiated by Victorians. There is some public reflection going on, and Senator Smith said he'd take the observations that come from his Victorian colleagues. Well, I point him to some of them. No less than our Senate President, Scott Ryan, said, 'Our voters sent us a message, and that is that some of the noise that comes out of this place and some of the noise that comes out of commentators about what it means to be Liberal—Liberal voters want us to focus on their issues.' He went on to say that the party was losing its electoral base, who didn't want conservative views rammed down their throats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Liberal MP, Ms Banks, who's now an Independent member for Chisholm, explained that they'd been led by members of the reactionary right wing and that the coup was aided by many MPs trading their vote for a leadership change in exchange for promotion, preselection or silence. 'Their actions were undeniably for themselves,' she said. She's speaking about a hard core of people who want to use the institutions of the parliament and their party for their own advancement rather than for the interests of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the thing that comes through most strongly in the public discussion by Liberals in Victoria is a focus on climate and energy. This is the signature failure of this government over the last five years. Ms O'Dwyer is reported to have told colleagues that the Liberals are now widely regarded as homophobic, anti-women climate-change deniers. The member for Goldstein, Mr Wilson, was even clearer, saying, 'If anybody thinks there is a great public sentiment out there that people hate renewables and they're hugging coal, I say: get real.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very sad thing for the Liberal Party, if they truly reflected on the history of the last five years, is that they've had plenty of opportunities. As the Labor Party, we wanted to establish a bipartisan energy policy that could deal with climate change. We offered bipartisanship. We offered it in relation to the energy intensity scheme proposed by Mr Frydenberg. We offered it in relation to the clean energy target, which was proposed by Dr Finkel, who spent a great deal of time examining the energy system. We certainly offered it in relation to the NEG, a policy that they put through their party room and then walked away from. And we offer it still, because what business will tell you—business will tell anyone who listens—is that all they need is certainty in relation to energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an investment strike on at the moment. We have ageing energy facilities operating past their use-by date, and they need to be replaced. But no private sector investor wants to act at the moment because this government, over five years, has been incapable of producing any clear energy policy. In that environment, investors have gone on strike. That is what has driven prices up. That is what all of the organisations paid to advise us tell us. And until they take the opportunity to collaborate, they will continue to fail on this front. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What an absolute joke. What a farce. Earlier today, I asked a question of the minister representing the so-called Prime Minister in this place: 'Why did our Prime Minister feel that the House of Representatives was the appropriate place for him to criticise the young people of Australia?' Why did he feel that it was his role to tell thousands of young people, who are concerned about the impact of climate change on their future, that they should simply sit down, shut up and go back to school? And what did we hear from this crumbling, directionless, miserable excuse of a flee-bitten administration? What did we hear? 'Kids should be in school.' That was the only response given. I'll tell you something: the young people of Australia look to the actions of this government in this place and they are revolted. They see behaviour which, if it was used in their classroom, they would be admonished for and expelled for, and yet it is part of the course in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They see a government willing to roll out the red carpet to the coal barons and the gas merchants, who are willing to chop and blast and bench their future, their environment, to make a quick buck. They look to these things and they are revolted. They demand of us that we work for them and that we hold clearly in our mind in every action that we take that our role here is to serve the young people of Australia and create a better future for them. They are connected, they hear what we say in here, they watch us closely. They can see very clearly that when the Prime Minister so patronisingly dismisses the concerns of young people when it comes to climate change, when he drags himself into this building holding a lump of coal like a talisman, he does so at the behest of his donors. He does so because he knows that to do any differently is to be unable to fund his election campaigns and to be unable to plaster the airwaves and the television screens with the cruel, racist, xenophobic nonsense which now comprises an election campaign run by the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The moral compass of this government was sold off long ago to the highest bidders, to the Gina Rineharts and Andrew Forrests, who so covet the wealth of my state and who right now prowl the halls of my state parliament singing the siren song of a fracking industry that will turn the water to poison. The young people of this nation look to this chamber. They plead with us to put them first and to act, for once, in their interests. And once again they have been shown that this administration has no desire to hear them. Shame on the lot of you. When election day comes, when your rendezvous with defeat is upon you, you will know how sorely you have underestimated the young people of this nation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The community of Sunbury in Western Australia regularly experiences petrol prices significantly higher than other towns in the South West region, despite Sunbury being the major regional centre.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a particularly important motion. It's an order for the production of documents. I'm absolutely shocked that Senator O'Sullivan would think it's acceptable to come into this place and yet again deny formality to a motion and disrupt, quite frankly, the orderly business of this chamber. This is a perfectly legitimate approach that Senator Hanson-Young has asked this chamber to consider. If he wants to vote no, he's got an opportunity to vote no. Senator Hanson-Young is seeking an order for the production of documents on a very important issue to do with water, to do with the Murray-Darling Basin, which has been so comprehensively mismanaged in this country. She has a perfect right to ask for these documents under an order for the production of documents, which is what she did.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The management of these lakes, as I understand it and recall from when I had this portfolio over a decade ago, is a very important part of the way that we manage water in the Murray-Darling Basin. I urge this chamber to support the suspension of standing orders so that Senator Hanson-Young can move this motion so as to ensure that the order for the production of documents is dealt with and voted on. Senator O'Sullivan and that side of the chamber can make their opinion well known to this place at that time, but at least allow us to put this motion in order to debate it.</span>

                    </a>  When you are finished I'll continue. So, it was co-sponsored, a reference was put up, and we travelled all over the country to investigate these very issues. Senator Hanson-Young turned up at one committee meeting, disrupted it and made allegations that she couldn't substantiate. Notwithstanding that she's been confronted by both the Australian Labor Party and our side of politics to withdraw the allegations in this place, at the committee meeting and at private meetings of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, she has failed to do that. So her opportunity to be able to get every one of these documents at some prior time through the power of a references committee of this Senate has been and passed. So you can only draw one conclusion: again, there is a pure political motive behind this particular motion here today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That aside, I love the indignation of the Greens. It is very well refined. They've been denying formality on motions in this place regularly. But, of course, when the time comes and formality is denied to their motions—and I heard Senator Anning made a contribution before that they better get used to it, and I would agree with his contribution—all we get is this false indignation from them about interfering in the course of them being able to put a question to the floor of the Senate to be voted on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know how this all started. I put a question to the floor of the Senate to have it voted on, and I had formality denied—and that has been done on a number of occasions, including yesterday. So this will go on and on. It is a denial of free speech—although, in this case, of course, Senator Hanson-Young can't make that case.</span>

She didn't turn up. She didn't front. It was her inquiry, co-sponsored with the Australian Labor Party, and she didn't turn up. There's a bit of Nick Xenophon in her—and I don't mean that to be a double reference. But there's a bit of Xenophon in her—references committees and not attending.</span>

                    </a>  All right, I'm happy to say that they were spoken. Our position on this motion does not reflect at all a view that that was appropriate. I am advised—obviously I've only just come into the chamber—that Senator O'Sullivan was asked to withdraw, and he did. As a party of government, we have always made clear, often in difficult circumstances such as today, that in opposition and in government we support the procedures of the Senate and have always supported rulings of the President of the day. It is clear from the advice that I was provided that Senator Di Natale was given an opportunity to withdraw by the Senate and refused to do so. In those circumstances—and we would apply this across the chamber—the opposition is left with no option but to support the chair in their reasonable exercise of standing orders. I do make clear again that nothing in the opposition's actions today in any way endorses the statement that was made by Senator O'Sullivan in this chamber, which I and the opposition regard as reprehensible.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  by leave—As the person in this chamber whom the reprehensible and disgusting comments were directed to by Senator O'Sullivan, I want to make it very clear that I am thankful to Senator Di Natale for standing up and calling them out. That is what real men do. Real men don't insult and threaten women, they don't slut-shame them and they don't attack them and make them feel bullied in their workplace. I have sat in this chamber for weeks and weeks—months—and heard the disgusting slurs and attacks coming from a particular group in this place, and I for one am sick of it, and I know many of my female colleagues on all sides of politics are sick of it, too. I will name you because you are not fit to be in this chamber, you're not fit to represent your constituents and you're not fit to call yourselves men: Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Anning, Senator Bernardi and Senator Leyonhjelm. You day after day come into this place, hurl insults across this chamber and play the gender card, and, the moment anyone stands up to you, you have the most fragile glass jaws of all. You are cowards. Every time you get called out, you refuse to stand by it.</span>

So I would ask those opposite—I know that this is a difficult debate, but perhaps we can let Senator Hanson-Young finish and, if government senators wish to respond, they can. So could we try and maintain some dignity in a very difficult time.

He was asked to withdraw, and he has refused. I back him in that. However, I do reflect on what Senator Wong has just called for, and that is a little more decorum in this place. But let me say: decorum does not mean sitting by and staying silent while people bully and intimidate. A particular group of men come into this place and hurl insults across the chamber.

I would note that, over the course of this week and recent weeks, that section of the day known as 'housekeeping', where motions are moved—where they're meant to be moved without debate—has, increasingly, become fraught, and has, increasingly, become a part of the sitting day that does not reflect well on this chamber.</span>

But I do think, Mr President, that colleagues should reflect on the conduct we have seen here, over recent days and over the last few weeks, during the part of the day when motions are moved. All of us should seek to be our best selves and to present this chamber in its best light as we all seek to do that which we are elected to do, which is to undertake business on behalf of the people who elected us here. It is appropriate that we do pause and reflect.</span>

Talking about making sexist statements in this chamber or accusing others in this chamber of constantly having a go at Sarah Hanson-Young, the senator, or at the Greens is hypocritical, because, constantly, over the last 2½ years, I have had comments thrown at me, constantly, all the time, on how I am a racist. And other comments have been made towards me. I just see this as crocodile tears, as theatrical and to get sympathy. And using the 'sexist' tag because she's a female doesn't wash, with me or a lot of other people.</span>

The chamber voted correctly to suspend Senator Di Natale. He made comments towards Senator O'Sullivan that were very much uncalled for and shouldn't have been said. So, I'd say to the Greens: it's a two-way street in here. You can't keep dishing it out to everyone else and not expect to get the same back. We all have a place in this parliament. We've all been voted in by the Australian people, and we all should have respect for each other.

Don't start crying wolf when the fact is that sometimes the finger needs to be pointed at the Greens and at their behaviour in this chamber. I don't believe Senator O'Sullivan's comments were sexist. I'm making that statement from a female's point of view, and I was in the chamber and I listened to his comments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I'm going to make an observation before I call another senator. I had hoped I would never use that standing order. I can't remember when it was last used. I think it was when John Howard was Prime Minister. That was actually before my time in parliament—more than 15 years ago. I made a statement when parliament resumed here in August about behaviour in this chamber, about the language, about the example we set and about how this chamber needs to operate. I ask every senator to reflect not just on what they think they're saying but on how it may be received or interpreted by another with a different life experience or perspective than yourself. That applies to a statement that may seem innocuous. It applies to a pejorative label that someone else may take deep offence to. There are very few people in politics who have a halo and who can't reflect on something they might have said that could have been expressed better. But if we cannot debate and act civilly in this chamber—which is the most representative chamber in this country and is the prime legislative chamber of this parliament—then how can we expect people outside the chamber to debate and argue and disagree respectfully?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other people may like to make comments. On this particular event, Senator O'Sullivan, the comment was inappropriate. I asked you to withdraw. I then asked you to unconditionally withdraw, and I believe you did. It is regrettable that I had to ask the Senate to enforce a ruling with respect to the privilege of the chair. I hope I don't have to do that again.</span>

                    </a>  Firstly, I want to correct the record. Senator Hanson-Young was in the chamber when that comment was made. She was not in the chamber when I first moved her motion, but she came directly in as I was on my feet, so she was here when Senator O'Sullivan was making his statements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Senator Di Natale did not make his decision to not withdraw very lightly. No senator in this place, I would think, wants to get suspended. But that is how strongly Senator Di Natale feels about what has been happening in this chamber, about what we have been enduring in this part of the chamber. It is not just the usual banter—and we all engage in that usual banter. It is not the usual banter. As a woman, I can say that I was extremely offended by what I heard Senator O'Sullivan say—which I will never repeat. It was an awful thing for him to say. But the senator gets to withdraw an awful, disgusting statement that we've all heard, and that's it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not good enough, and that's the point that Senator Di Natale was making. To utter those statements—and it's not the first type of awful statement that we have heard at this end of the chamber, which I acknowledge, Mr President, you don't always hear. That's because it's said at this end of the chamber and because of the acoustics. We have endured that. It is not acceptable. But somebody gets to say that and then withdraw it. That is the point that Senator Di Natale is trying to make. That is not acceptable behaviour. We have been enduring it for a long time. I agree with you that things have to change. It needs some leadership for it to change. But I hope never to hear somebody say that type of thing again in this Senate.</span>

Whether it's Senator O'Sullivan or anyone else, it seems inappropriate and not in accordance with the rules. Perhaps he should seek a personal explanation, but that requires leave, and on the basis of what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has just done, that would also be denied. It seems inappropriate in Australia that you can be accused by name and not given the right to defend yourself.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Macdonald, I do not write the standing orders. I enforce them as determined by the Senate. There are other opportunities in the program of the Senate, including the open-ended adjournment on Tuesday, for senators to raise other issues. Leave is not granted; therefore I will return to the debate on the suspension of standing orders, and I call Senator O'Sullivan to continue his contribution.</span>

                    </a>  Just one moment. I did withdraw it. When you read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, you will see that I denied the connotation placed on my words, but I withdrew it to assist the chair. I set the scene in my speech. The speech was about Senator Hanson-Young. I said two things. One is about how she co-sponsored a reference committee and then didn't turn up. That is No. 1. Secondly, how did she deal with that? She comes in today to take up the time of the Senate with a motion in this place to debate it to get a grandstand on broadcasting day. They were the actions of Senator Nick Xenophon. That's exactly champagne. I won't repeat my comments to her. You look at them in the context of what I've just said. I could not have prepared it. My debate was around her behaviour and it reflected on the fact that she reflected the operations, if you like, of Senator Nick Xenophon in more than one way. You can do what you will with it. I don't feel one bit of embarrassment about the reference I made. I did withdraw it to assist the chair. They are the ones who placed the connotation on it. This happens every day with this crowd. They're the ones who put some identification around it. They spoke even before they thought. I ask you to go to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, reflect on my speech, my contribution in the debate, reflect on what I said, put the two together, and you will arrive where I have guided you to. I did not make an imputation on Senator Hanson-Young in the manner that they have described.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The war on drugs is a war on people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The approach to illicit drug use in this country has been an unmitigated disaster, and it is time our political leaders had some courage and recognised that we need to start treating the issue of drug use as a health issue, not as a law-and-order issue. We need to reform our laws and introduce the right regulatory framework to make that vision a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current approach to the prohibition of cannabis causes a great deal more harm than it prevents. Around the world we are seeing governments recognise this and start to change their laws on this issue. Recreational cannabis is now legal in some states in the United States, Canada and some South American countries. Only last week Congressman Joe Kennedy said in an opinion piece that the United States should legalise cannabis on a federal level. He was previously a sceptic, but is now advocating for federal legalisation in the United States because recreational cannabis use should be treated as a health issue, not a criminal one. He recognises, as we implore the Australian Government to do with this bill, that a regulated recreational cannabis market is the best way to achieve this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nearly seven million Australians, well over a third of Australians, have used cannabis at some point in their life. This drug is being used widely, despite the current illegality of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cannabis has potential harms associated with its use—there is no question of this. It's a drug like many other drugs, be they legal or illegal, and therefore has a range of effects on human physiology. We know that the young developing brain should not be exposed to cannabis, in the same way as it shouldn't be exposed to alcohol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While cannabis is not a harmless drug; neither is paracetamol. The more interesting question is how harmful it is relative to other substances. There is no doubt in my mind, and in the view of many health professionals, that cannabis is a much safer drug than alcohol, a drug that is currently legal; indeed, many would say our society is awash with alcohol. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You can't overdose when it comes to cannabis. You can overdose when it comes to other drugs. Indeed, you can become very unwell and die from alcohol toxicity. People who consume vast quantities of alcohol can aspirate it, and aspiration is a common cause of death amongst young people. That simply doesn't happen when it comes to cannabis. We know that alcohol has a whole range of other effects on people's livers; it can be a cause of liver failure and liver cancer. We know that that's simply not the case when it comes to cannabis. Alcohol has a whole range of effects on the gastrointestinal system—things that aren't seen with cannabis consumption. The reality is that if we are applying the standard of cannabis being a harmful drug, then, by that same standard, we should make alcohol illegal. We don't, because we accept that the use of alcohol also comes with a range of benefits to the community. People continue to use it; they do it because they enjoy it, and they'll continue to do it regardless of what policymakers suggest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But, beyond the relative harm of cannabis compared to alcohol, the more important question is: what are the harms happening right now under our current system? We know those harms are significant. We know that many people are exposed to drugs of unknown quality and purity. They are being driven to purchase their drugs through a network of criminal dealers. And what we see is a current system that props up criminality and that redirects resources away from where they're needed, to prosecute these laws which are having no effect deterring people from using the drug. They divert a huge amount of taxpayer money into areas that aren't working, when we could be investing in a whole range of areas that we know do work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let's be very clear about what we need to do when it comes to cannabis. We need to ensure that our laws reduce harm and reflect the fact that cannabis is actually less harmful than some currently available, and legal, drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill that I am introducing today, the Australian Cannabis Agency Bill 2018 creates a regulated legal market for cannabis, with a new federal government agency—the Australian Cannabis Agency—as the sole buyer and wholesaler of recreational cannabis. This will be achieved through the Agency issuing licences for the production of cannabis and the sale of cannabis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any Australian will be eligible to apply for a production licence, and the Agency will grant these licences subject to conditions set by the Agency in conjunction with the board. These conditions will include: that the licence holder cannot distribute recreational cannabis other than by selling it to the Agency; and that the licence holder must permit the Agency to inspect the premises at which cannabis is being produced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, any Australian will be eligible to apply for a distribution licence. These licences will have a number of more specific conditions on them. These conditions will mean that recreational cannabis can: only be sold to people over 18 years of age, and only that which is sold by the Agency. This cannabis will be sold in plain packaging with any warnings determined by the Agency at the time of distribution. People who are licensed to distribute it will be trained in mental health first aid and the responsible distribution of it. Finally, all licences will be granted with the condition that the premises at which cannabis is sold could be, at any time, inspected by the Agency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In effect, this will mean that- rather than being purchased through a criminal dealer, who has no interest in the welfare of the user, cannabis would be regulated in the same way that tobacco is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The training that the bill requires people who sell cannabis to have will help ensure that anybody identified as having a problem with cannabis use is redirected into treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In our plan there would be no advertising or sponsorship for cannabis. We don't want to make the same mistakes that were made in the alcohol industry. We'd be promoting small-scale production and ensuring that people are getting access to a regulated product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agency will be governed by a Board which will have members from every State and Territory Government and experts from the areas of harm reduction, clinical expertise, mental health, user advocates and law enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agency will be required to carry out a program of monitoring and a review of the scheme after the first two years of its establishment. The bill requires that this review is provided to the Minister, and that the Minister must respond in writing within six months of the review. Both the review and the response must be tabled in both houses of Parliament. This public accountability will ensure that there is ongoing public scrutiny of the scheme and how it is operating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will support Australians to grow cannabis at home for personal use. Some states and territories already allow this to happen, but under this bill it will start to be harmonised so that people can grow up to seven plants in their backyard, providing it's for their own personal use. Those people wouldn't be able to sell what they have grown, because we want to ensure we have a regulated market in the same way as we have for other markets, but those people would be free to grow and produce their own product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our plan would impose strict penalties on the sale of unlicenced or black market cannabis. If people are going to access a regulated product of known quality and purity from a known grower, we have to ensure the market has clear regulations associated with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the bill provides exceptions for the production and distribution of medicinal cannabis and applies only to recreational cannabis. The Australian Greens are supportive of medicinal cannabis being regulated in a separate way, and are continuing our efforts to ensure that all Australians have equitable access to cannabis to help their medical conditions. We will continue working to ensure that these pathways are simple and affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is limited by a number of Constitutional requirements, which—when it is passed—we will seek to overcome. The bill applies only in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. However, the scheme could apply nationally if all states were to refer their powers to regulate cannabis under paragraph 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. When this bill passes, we will work with our colleagues in state governments to have them sign up to the scheme. This will ensure that we have a consistent national scheme, which will reduce confusion and ensure that people are not able to access regulated cannabis in one state, but only able to access it via the black market in another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the Constitution provides that a law imposing taxation must not originate in the Senate and section 55 provides that a law imposing taxation must deal only with the imposition of taxation. When this bill passes, we will work with our colleagues in the other place to ensure that over time all elements of the scheme we propose will be legislated and implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After this is passed, we will also work to reduce some of the existing criminal penalties associated with the use of cannabis. However, it is important to have a regulated scheme in place before that happens—to ensure drug dealers don't simply get a free pass with reduced penalties prior to having a well thought through, regulated scheme in place.</span>

The government has invested over $300 million to improve women's safety since 2015, focusing on practical measures that reduce the incidence of violence and supporting victims and their children. The government is developing the fourth action plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. Legislation is currently before the parliament to provide a minimum standard of five days of unpaid domestic violence leave, as recommended by the Fair Work Commission.</span>

                  </a>  There is no doubt that many people, not only women but men as well, are in crisis when it comes to domestic violence. My motion on 19 September called on the federal government to fill the data-sharing gaps as outlined in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report published earlier this year. Right now my home state of Western Australia is unfortunately the domestic violence capital of Australia, and we know that the effect and impact domestic violence has on children is devastating. My motion earlier this year urged the federal government to provide more relief housing and crisis accommodation for all victims of domestic violence. With the festive season just around the corner, when domestic violence tends to spike, it is vital that all levels of government do their bit to provide a safe haven for Australians in need.</span>

The Commonwealth has been working cooperatively with the states and territories to implement a new national consumer protection framework for online wagering following the O'Farrell review into illegal offshore wagering, which this government commissioned. We have already passed one tranche of legislation, and there is more work to do. The Commonwealth will continue working in partnership with the states and territories to ensure a responsible regulatory framework for online wagering.</span>

                  </a>  Labor believes well-regulated gambling has a place in Australian society and acknowledges the need for appropriate harm-minimisation measures to protect children and problem gamblers. That is why Labor supported stronger consumer protection initiatives in response to the O'Farrell review, including amendments to the Interactive Gambling Act and the introduction of a national consumer protection framework. Labor supports the intent of this motion. However, in view of the work currently in train across government, including on a national self-exclusion scheme, Labor is not in a position to support it at this time but urges the government to release the new framework without delay.</span>

                  </a>  Under the Liberals, almost nine in 10 public schools will never get to 100 per cent of the School Resourcing Standard because the Liberals have capped federal funding for public schools at just 20 per cent of the SRS. We won't take lectures from the Greens, who wanted to back the Liberals when they introduced a school funding package which allowed this to occur. When Lee Rhiannon refused to back down, her reward was Senator Faruqi knocking her off in preselection. The Greens know that 100 per cent of funding can only happen if state and territory governments agree, so it is not something that this parliament can commit to.</span>

Labor's goal over time is to get every public school to 100 per cent of its fair funding level. But that requires funding commitments from the states and territories, and we are putting back the funding that the Greens were complicit in getting ripped out of schools.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens are proudly the party of public education. We are unapologetic in our advocacy for a well-resourced, world-class public education system. I'm proud to have announced the Greens plan to ensure that every public school is to be fully funded. We must make sure that every public school receives 100 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard by 2023 and has the capital funds to build the learning and teaching facilities that are needed, and that funding cuts for students with disability are reversed. And we must also reverse the deals with the private schools, struck disgustingly by the Liberals, which Labor doesn't have the guts to cancel. It's simple: with public money, the 2.5 million children in public schools have to come first, and the Greens will always stand by them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion that I've moved today relates to the water impacts of another mega-mine proposed for the Galilee Basin. We've already got the Adani coalmine, ticked off by both sides of politics, which would drink 12½ billion litres from the Suttor River. It would also then suck six gigalitres of groundwater. This newly proposed coalmine, the China Stone mine, which had its EIS ticked off by the Queensland government last Thursday, would double the water take on that delicate region, which is already in drought. We know that 58 per cent of Queensland is already in drought. The last thing we need is for farmers to be asked to tighten their belts while the coalmines get free, unlimited groundwater, as the Queensland Labor government has given them, and a licence to take all of the surface water that they desire from the Suttor River.</span>

Let's actually look at the cumulative impacts of these mines in the Galilee Basin before you approve yet another water-sucking thermal coal mine.' I have another motion that I've submitted for consideration tomorrow, which relates to the climate impacts of this mine, and I'll have another motion, again, which relates to this mine not ever receiving public funding. But today's motion relates to the water impacts of this mine. I would urge both sides of the chamber to think seriously about prioritising the water needs of not just the planet but those other water users in that drought-stricken region when deciding how to vote on this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very disappointed that I've had to suspend standing orders in order to move this motion. We've seen a pattern over the last few days of a number of senators denying leave. The low level of behaviour that this chamber has stooped to in the last few days has already been spoken about very eloquently, and we just saw a most revolting display of sexism from one of the particular senators who is, sadly, a repeat offender in that regard. Now we have leave being denied for us to conduct the business of the Senate. We seek to get through these motions. We have every right to move these motions. We don't want to delay the chamber, but we will not be silenced by randos who want to deny leave for reasons that are known only to themselves, with no good reason and certainly without the support of the chamber. Be it upon yourselves. We will continue to move substantive motions that we support and that are based in fact and based in science. If you continue to act like naughty preschoolers in denying leave for us to conduct the business of this parliament then we will sadly continue to use standing orders to bring reasonable issues to the attention of this chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks and urge once again that we consider the water impacts of mega-coalmines as well as the climate impacts, the social impacts and all the other impacts of the destructive potential for a second huge thermal coal mega-mine in the Galilee Basin. I urge that we consider these matters and that we be able to vote on this motion.</span>

The proposed coalmine has been subject to a detailed environmental impact assessment and considered in accordance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development has also provided advice on the proposal. The Commonwealth will make a decision on whether to approve the China Stone coalmine proposal once the Queensland government's evaluation report is carefully reviewed.

In doing so, we note that the assessment undertaken by the independent expert scientific committee for this proposal was based on early information and their advice, therefore, necessarily identifies further information and data that is needed to address the questions raised.

This updated assessment must consider any impacts on the Great Artesian Basin and other groundwater systems; groundwater-fed springs, systems and ecosystems; groundwater bores; river, streams and creeks; and availability of water for agriculture users and the environment. In accordance with the standard practice of the independent expert scientific committee, the analysis should consider the cumulative water-related impact of the proposal in the context of past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions. Labor expects the results and modelling must be made publicly available immediately after the final document is received by the minister.</span>

                  </a>  It is not free. Adani have paid in the vicinity of $19 million to the Queensland state government for the use of this water. It is coming out of the river, but the river has to be over a certain level and floodwaters to actually use it. The Adani mining company have actually been to all the farmers around there and have assured them that they will have water security and that the mine will not take water from the farmers. They are quite agreeable with that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are hearing here is scaremongering—again—by the Greens, who want to shut down industry, manufacturing, the farming sector and native vegetation. They want to shut down everything in this country. They want to take this country back to absolutely nothing. In Queensland, where we make about $55 billion from our resources in the state, they want to shut down a mine that is very instrumental and important in bringing money into the economy and, indirectly, about 10,000 jobs. Directly, the mine itself will employ 1,462 people. But the Greens aren't interested in that. They have their jobs in this place and they are not worried about other Queenslanders being able to pay their bills or put a roof over their head.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They continue to raise these issues, and they use mining as if it is going to destroy the Great Barrier Reef. That is another furphy—when it is about 350 miles from the Great Barrier Reef. When mining has been going on for over 100 years and has not destroyed the Barrier Reef, how is this Adani mine all of a sudden going to shut down the Great Barrier Reef? This is just not true. They are scaremongering. That is what this is all about. I have had extensive talks with Adani mining, and I have asked them direct questions. If I thought that this was in any way going to have an impact on the land, on water resources, on the farming sector or on the Great Barrier Reef, I would be the first one standing up and fighting against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have really done some homework on this and I really know what is going to happen. This is not about votes. This is not about shutting our country down, but that is exactly what it is doing. The Greens talk about wanting to put in windfarms, and they want to shut down the mining. Australia has coking coal. A lot of the mining in Queensland is coking coal. The Adani mine is thermo. That goes to energy. Every windmill that is built takes 220 tonnes of coal to build. Why we have coking coal, and why China and others countries want our coking coal, is to use it to make steel. That's why they want it. The best steel in the world comes from our coking coal. If you want to build more windmills around the country and around the world then you need our coal to build them. It is the coking coal that gives us the best steel. If you want to cut out mining in this country, consider where you are going to get your windmills from. It takes 220 tonnes of coal to make a windmill in this country. Stop spreading the lies. I say to you—through you, Mr President—stop spreading your lies and fearmongering and stop trying to say that the whole world is coming to an end. It's not coming to an end. It will come to an end if the Greens ever get control of this parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Before I go on in this debate, the clock can be paused. This particular section of the Senate's business is cascading—in behaviour and time. If there are motions moved to suspend standing orders to deal with the motion in a formal sense, I will apply the limits of the standing orders incredibly strictly: the terms of the debate will be about the suspension of standing orders and not about the substantive motion that the senator is seeking to have debated. I remind all senators that there is normally some tolerance for that. I will not let this session of the Senate's business, which is cascading, become a forum for de facto debate via suspension of standing orders. Any senator who wants to move or speak to a motion: limit what you are saying to the suspension of standing orders and do not seek to debate the substantive motion. </span>

I will apply it more strictly than it has been applied in the Senate, out of respect for the other 70 senators who don't get to speak in these debates because of the forum in which this is adopted other than by leave.

                  </a>  We should be suspending standing orders, because Senator Waters deserved to move this motion. It doesn't deserve to have leave denied. This is one of the most important issues of our lifetime. If you want to talk about water, what about that body of water off the coastline called the ocean? We have had two back-to-back bleaching events. Our best climate science models predicted it wasn't possible to have back-to-back coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef before 2050, yet, in 2016 and 2017, we had the fourth bleaching event in 10 years, with back-to-back bleaching. It's official: half the reef is dead. Half the Great Barrier Reef is dead. And guess what? Sadly, we are on track for a third bleaching—a third bleaching in four years. That will spell the end of the Great Barrier Reef. If it is anything like the bleaching events that we saw in 2016, that reef will not recover—not in our lifetime. Think about that. This is critical. This motion deserves to be moved. Any senator who doesn't believe that this is one of the most important issues facing not just this chamber and this country but humanity needs to get their head checked. They need a reality check. I have gone up there and stuck my head under the water, and I suggest that every senator does the same thing. The Senate Environment and Communications Committee went up there. We went out to the Great Barrier Reef. We heard from the exporters. We know that there are 60,000 jobs at stake if that barrier reef continues to die on our watch. The only thing we can do is take every possible means to cut emissions, both here in this country and overseas. That means no more coalmines and no more coal exports. That's what this motion is about. This is not just about the damage that this mine is going to do to the watertable in a drought impacted Queensland, in a country totally in drought, in a country with catastrophic bushfires, once again breaking temperature records.</span>

In my state of Tasmania we have lost our giant kelp forests—an ecosystem 10,000 years old that stretched from north-east Tasmania right to the bottom of south-west Tasmania, and it is gone, through climate change, the impacts of invasive species, warming waters, ocean acidification and extreme storms. That ecosystem was the home to all our commercial fisheries. That is just the beginning of what's going on off the coast of my state because of climate change. This is an issue that affects every single one of us. It couldn't be more serious. And to have it denied formality by the Senate—we need to be having a debate, we need to be suspending standing orders, we need to see this motion moved.</span>

We need no new coalmines. We need to take a very strong stand on this.</span>

Senator Steele-John, I counselled senators before that this is not a debate on the motion that you are seeking to have the Senate deal with. This is a motion on why the Senate should deal with it and why standing orders should be suspended. You have been speaking for 44 seconds, and I have heard references to the substantive issue. I am not going to see the Senate's time in this section of debate become longer and longer. It is not reasonable for the great majority of senators. This is a debate on the suspension of standing orders, and I call you to that specific motion, not the motion you seek to have the Senate address.</span>

                  </a>  Standing orders, Mr President, must be suspended so that the Senate is able to give the young people of Australia the answer which they demand to hear. The young people of this nation deserve to know whether their Senate is with them, and no amount of ignorance, no amount of intransigence from certain elements within the government should prevent this chamber from giving them that answer. I urge the chamber to support the suspension of standing orders to enable us to give them the answer which they so rightly deserve to have.</span>

                  </a>  It's terrific that young people want to get active on the issues that matter to them. Young people want to see the government take serious action on climate change. We share their strong feelings. We don't want to see students missing out on schoolwork. There are plenty of opportunities for young people to campaign for climate action outside of school time, including on school holidays and weekends, and we would be the first to support them. The Labor Party is the only party of government committed to action on climate change, with a commitment to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and an energy policy that delivers certainty for industry, lowers power prices and ensures more reliability.</span>

                  </a>  The case of the isolated people of the North Sentinel Island has highlighted a fact that many in this place are reluctant to admit: immigration can have a devastating effect on a people's culture and way of life. You would be hard pressed to find a single expert who would argue against protecting the Sentinelese people's culture and way of life through limiting migration to their island. I, for one, will not be condemning the Sentinelese as racist for keeping their borders closed. Nor will I condemn them for their lack of diversity. All peoples should have a right to decide their own fate, and I'm disappointed that the Senate refused to join me in acknowledging this.</span>

                  </a>  So, here we go again. As a male, I find it offensive—abhorrent, even—to sit in this chamber and have to listen to Senator Anning's disgusting diatribes. It's hard to imagine how deleterious it must be for female senators. It was awful to sit with my female staff at the last sitting—going through the reds, as we say—and to read Senator Anning's claims about abortion being, in his words as then circulated, 'state sanctioned murder and Queensland's new child-killing laws'. He's since cleaned up the wording in his new motion. But I just want to register my disgust that a male senator would deliberately use language that is hurtful to all Australian women who've had to make painful decisions about terminating a pregnancy.</span>

                  </a>  There are people, like Senator Anning and Senator O'Sullivan, who are so concerned with policing what women can do with their bodies that they're happy to trot out the old lie about late-term abortions. It is clear that if these senators actually cared about children they'd spend their time in the Senate talking about the plight of children locked up in offshore detention, who are self-harming as a result of the conditions they're being kept in by this government. They'd be calling for a rise in the minimum wage and more support for families who are struggling to make ends meet, because right now there are 739,000 Australian children living in poverty. These are the children those senators should be worried about. They would also be calling for this government to finally take action against the very real national security crisis of violence against women. The most dangerous place for a woman—and her children—to be is in her own home because she is most likely to be killed or injured by someone she knows, yet all we hear is how women need to be further controlled when it comes to their bodies.</span>

And they are under threat wherever you go. But, before I get into some of that, I'd like to discuss a matter that has been raised in the Senate which relates to freedom of speech and this cult of victimhood. Earlier—and I was absent from the chamber—Senator Hanson-Young decided that, as a woman, people like me, and she named me amongst others, have been slut-shaming her. I reject that in its entirety. I've never cast any aspersions on Senator Hanson-Young, aside from her behaviour in this chamber.</span>

Gender should be blind in this chamber, yet Senator Hanson-Young wants to make it a perpetual grievance—that somehow she's being maligned. She refuses to accept the fact that she yells the most vitriolic and vile abuse at others. I remember the homophobic slurs she would level at previous members of this place who she thought were same-sex attracted and hadn't admitted it. I remember the aberrations and admonishments because people like me didn't want to see asylum seekers drowning at sea. I've seen the cavalier manner in which she uses the truth sparingly in pursuit of her ideological aims. And now she stands up here, because her own leader got tossed out of this place for being unparliamentary—a matter which has been far too long coming because the Greens think the probity, the normality and the requirements of this place do not apply to them. They are sanctimonious and pious and, some would say—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have the freedom of religion. That doesn't mean that all religious beliefs are equal. People are free to believe what they want to believe, as long as they comply with Australian law. And you should be free to be critical of it. But of course you're not, because some environments make that unpalatable. A Christian in this society is suddenly an aberration and someone who can be disregarded. Yet a Muslim is someone whose wise words are sage and are coming down from whatever God they believe in, and they are to be pursued and should be listened to and respected. Aboriginal spirituality can be respected as well. It doesn't mean you can be blind or uncritical. People are free to believe what they like—what they want to believe—and we should be defending that right at every single turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, we should be defending the other unalienable rights that we have, like the freedom of personhood. It was not that long ago, if you remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, that some people in this country weren't regarded as people. Aboriginal people weren't regarded as people not that long ago—back when Sir Robert Menzies was talking about the forgotten people. And we have to defend the rights of all Australians equally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time we make legislation in this place, we talk about human rights, and it goes through the human rights committee, and there is a report on the human rights attached to it. Well, human rights are continually evolving and changing. They are handed down from on high, from the font of all wisdom—the United Nations! And the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> should pick up the sarcasm in that, because you get these groups of people who will register these new rights, and of course they compete with existing or traditional rights, the unalienable rights that I think are so important to preserve. So, if we want to adopt these things that infringe upon others, let the case be made for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us legislate for unalienable rights in this place, and then every piece of legislation, as it comes through this sausage factory, should have to undergo a scrutiny to examine what freedoms are being taken away from ordinary Australians, whether it be their right to privacy, or their freedom to conduct private affairs as they see fit, free of government interference, or freedom of speech, or the ability to pursue the ideas and thoughts that they think want to drive it. But we should not be silencing these things through victimhood, through shaming, however you want to call it—through this perpetual indulgence of identity politics. It is counterproductive, and it is doing us harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are many on that side as well who believe in freedoms, and there are many in the Liberal Party who do, and there are others elsewhere who do. But the greatest threat to our freedoms is what we do here, and, when you get people who stand up and complain about an interjection, that is a denying of formality. It happened yesterday—denying of formality—and one of the Labor senators stood up and said, 'As a woman, that's a sexist thing.' Well, how is it sexist that formality is denied, just because someone happens to be female? We're told, on the one hand, that gender doesn't matter, and then gender is used all the time as a means of cowing others into silence and trying to stifle the freedoms that we're meant to have in this chamber. Freedom of speech and parliamentary privilege, which we should be respecting, are even being silenced through this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to make a determination about what sort of society we want. People will look at me and say,' Yes, he's an archconservative'—I've had all that levelled at me—but, if being a conservative means I want the maximum amount of freedom for all individuals in this country to choose the life that they want within the constraints of a civil society, I will make no apologies for that because I do believe that civil society is absolutely important, and yet we are slowly breaking that down, too. There are elements within this chamber and within the other place, and in politics around the country—extraneous groups—that are lobbying to diminish some of the institutions that protect us and give us this maximum freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to see how things have diminished in the public eye—much of it of their own making, might I add, in their failure to deal with some issues—look at the religious institutions, who make no apologies for that. Then look at the other great institution, the institution of parliament, and things have been diminished again and again and again, so much so—I said this to a friend of mine the other night—that we don't have the leadership that can take a country forward. We don't see it on that side of the chamber or on this side of the chamber. We don't see it; we just see politics being played out every single time for short-term opportunism, and the end result is that we've undermined one of the most important institutions that we have in this place. If we continue to do this, we will erode further the freedoms that Australians have long cherished and really won't notice until they've gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen freedom of speech eroded in Australia. We know that there's a subjective clause. If you've got a hurt feeling, you can go to a tribunal and make the case that your feelings have been hurt and the tribunal will investigate it. They will make your life a misery if they want to, and it will cost you a load of money outside of the judicial system for a very long period of time. So, wouldn't it be better for us as legislators to say, 'These are the rights that all Australians have by virtue of their citizenship of this country,' and every single time we want to take away a bit of those rights, every time we want them to be addressed through a channel other than through the common law, if I can put it like that, we have to make the case? If someone wants to take you to a tribunal because of their subjective hurt feelings test, let the first rule be: 'Hang on, what are the unalienable rights of Australians?' Do you know what: one of them is to annoy the heck out of other people! We're all going to do that. If any of you are in a relationship or in a family or in a community group where people don't upset each other along the way, you're subject to groupthink—I can tell you that. Even in my own party, we manage to upset ourselves occasionally, and there's only one of me at the moment! It's a principle of the matter: if we're going to go down this path, we have to be prepared to defend freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to have this debate today. I want others to stand with it and rationalise why we can't have freedom and why we can't trust people to have the cut and thrust of positive and negative argument, to debate things and to get things resolved. And, if we want to remove a right for people in this place, then we need to justify why.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  In my life prior to coming to the parliament, I operated a consultancy whose affairs were all across the world. In fact, I departed from this country on over 350 occasions to multiple international destinations. Most trips were to three, four or five countries. So I've spent an extraordinary amount of time offshore. I think my late wife calculated that I often spent up to four months a year offshore between 15 and 20 of these trips. They were right throughout Asia and to some exotic places that, I must admit, I have no ambition to return to. I went to the Middle East, Europe, North America and Canada. You can, if you like, think that perhaps I'm a bit parochial about Australia, but one thing I do know is that, particularly around the rights, the freedoms and the democratic environment that we have in this nation, I couldn't find anywhere in the world to compare to it—I simply couldn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't find anywhere in the world to compare to the culture of our nation, our ability to get on with each other. We are a nation that I think is a very fair-minded nation. I think we're a very generous nation in so many ways. I don't talk about the fact that we are a new nation, because we are one of the oldest nations on earth. But I think the balance that has come—including the contribution made to our culture in this nation by the original Australians, their nation, as they've allowed us to share it with them—is such that we have got the balance right between rights and freedoms. It doesn't matter where you go in the world; I'll point out for you where I think there are serious imbalances around the rights and the freedoms of citizens. Obviously, the challenge is that, when you give a right or you take a right away, it affects your freedom. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm 61 years of age, and over the last five or six years we've seen a massive acceleration of progressive ideas in this country. There are many reasons for it, and I don't intend to particularise all of them; there is social media and the use of the internet. We've seen complete libertarianism in its purest form: everybody should be able to do anything, whenever they like, without having regard to the fact that they live in a broader community where some of the views might not be shared. That in itself is a challenge for our nation as we continue to develop our culture. But a much bigger challenge are the advocates of some of these extremely left-wing progressive ideas, and I name, in this chamber, the Greens. It is the manner in which they and their followers are executing these minority ideals that they say they represent. They talk about being bullied. I'll tell you what: you need to move down to this end of the chamber if you don't feel bullied. You need to move down this end of the chamber and listen to the Greens in unison as they attack the contributions of many on the crossbench and many of us who stand up on centre-Right and generally more conservative issues. If you want to talk about the loss of freedoms that they talk about today—inhibiting free speech—you need to go back to what started this range war in this chamber. That was me moving a motion—a sensible, balanced motion representing the views of so many in my home state of Queensland, a more conservative state perhaps than anywhere in the country—and being denied formality. That was the first shot, and it's deteriorated from there at a pace that we haven't seen in this place, at least not in the five years that I've been here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you open your mouth—I happen to be a Roman Catholic and a proud Roman Catholic. I was educated in the Roman Catholic way, through the catechism, and it remains with me and has done for my entire life. For me to have one of these offensive individuals in the Greens call out, 'You keep your rosaries off my ovaries,' think about how offensive that statement is. That is an attack, firstly, on my Christianity, on my Roman Catholic religious status, and it's an attack on my right—and I get the old, 'You're an old, fat white man; you can't talk on this.' Well, I'm not talking about women's rights; I'm talking about the rights of an infant who is in some instances only minutes or hours off being born, being given life. That's who my voice is for. I said it here very early in my Senate career: I am here to give a voice to those who don't have a strong voice for themselves. You can find my motions offensive, you can find my contributions as I debate your motions to be offensive, but you cannot deny me the right to express myself. As to the methodology and the bullying that comes out against those of us who want to take a steadier hand as we make changes in the culture of this nature, we are entitled to express ourselves, and we do it in a very measured way, a sensible way and a way reflective of our constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know the episode last week, when I said, 'I'll declare myself to be a woman and then you won't be able to attack me anymore.' I promise you that I found every freak in the Southern Hemisphere, who wrote the vilest of remarks that you could ever imagine—starting, of course, with one of my colleagues from the Greens, who called me about six or seven names that ended in 'ism'. I must admit I didn't recognise three or four of them. I probably need to do some research and might have to fess up to one or two. The fact of the matter is that I exercised my right of free speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the right in this chamber—in this 'cathedral of democracy', as some references are made—and, in fact, the responsibility to put issues forward, debate them sensibly and then tie ourselves to the result. That's why this attack on freedom of speech occurs. That's why there is this bullying of us. They don't want the world to see how they might vote on something that they find offensive—the fact that we might want to preserve the life of unborn children. They don't want to be called to account. They don't want to see which side of the chamber they end up on. That's how this all started. That's how the first shot was fired here—and the deterioration hasn't ended yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't speak for anybody else, but you will not silence me; you will not mute me. I will take all of my rights to speak, to present ideas to this place and to put motions to this floor, and I'll do what it takes to try to bring you to put your feet on the sticky paper about whether you are yea or nay in relation to issues that are significantly important to so many people in this nation and most certainly to the constituency that I represent in my home state of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bullying, the intimidation, the calling of names and the interjections that come from some in this chamber won't work. They haven't worked. They didn't work today, they won't work tomorrow, and they won't work next week. I've made a contribution to where we are. I said to my colleagues the other morning, 'We're down in the mudflats now; we're just all tadpoles at the moment.' I've contributed to that and I haven't finished with it yet. I will bring it to its knees until it fails to function in the form that it has been functioning.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate today on this matter of public importance put forward by Senator Bernardi: 'The increasing attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms.' I have to ask: what does that even mean? It means different things to different people. It perhaps depends which freedom you're talking about and which side of the debate you're on. I for one would see the attacks on workers—their right to strike and their right to negotiate—as very much an agenda coming from this government, where it has attacked traditional freedoms. The way workers captured by the ABCC historically have been targeted is very much an attack on traditional freedoms. I would hope that Senator Bernardi is in fact talking about the great steps forward in social justice in this country, but, sadly, I disagree with how Senator Bernardi characterises those steps forward as an attack on traditional freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely we've improved on traditional freedoms in Australia. We have improved and we want to keep doing so. What could be a more traditional institution than marriage, and it's the fact that the LGBTI community embraced it as a traditional institution that has seen 5,000 same-sex marriages take place this year in Australia. Tomorrow, it will be one year since the marriage equality bill passed through this chamber. Five thousand people now have their relationships recognised in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of their families, and they did so for very traditional reasons: the idea and the desire to celebrate their love and commitment as a couple in front of their friends and family and to have that recognised by the laws of this nation—a freedom that was previously denied to gay and lesbian Australians but was accessible to heterosexual peers. I see these as improved freedoms, and, indeed, traditional ones. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What could be more important, in terms of freedom, than enabling children in our schools to go to school safely and to be protected from discrimination? I was listening to Megan Mitchell in the discussions last week that we had on the discrimination in schools referral that I chaired. She spoke to me about one of the exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act, not about LGBTI students, but, in fact, on young pregnant women and the high levels of marginalisation and discrimination that they experience in our community. I find it so, so, so terribly ironic that those who champion an anti-choice agenda on women's reproductive rights—and I do not begrudge them those opinions; they're entitled to those opinions—then stand up for the right of a school to exclude a young woman from an education just because she happens to be pregnant. It is absolutely galling. Young women might get pregnant while at school; it does happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are young LGBTI people, young people who do not fit in a gender box, and it might well be because they have intersex sex characteristics that mean they don't want to be easily attributed to a gender, although I do note that most people who have intersex sex characteristics have a very strong gender identification. But sometimes the issue is that it's not the one that you would have state governments tick a box on at birth. I find it absolutely extraordinary that people in this place would see the fact that state governments don't necessarily see this as the most significant thing in the world—that every child should have every bit of information ticked to say which gender box they belong in. Surely parents and teachers—you meet a child; you know whether it's male or female. What is this hysteria about? Are you the gender police? Is that the traditional freedom of having the state running around inspecting the genitals of children so that you know which gender box they fit in? It's a pretty extraordinary thing, frankly, to ask the state to do on behalf of a society. If the church wants to do that, go ahead and do it—if your religious faith wants to do that. But, really, senators, what is the place of the state in upholding these freedoms? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to LGBTI discrimination against students, the government have promised to resolve this issue by the end of the year, but, as each day goes by, the government are still sitting on their hands. You've refused to proceed with a simple removal of the relevant exemption that would protect young women like the ones I spoke about and who have been advocated for by the Children's Commissioner, Megan Mitchell. It's extraordinary that in the week before the Wentworth by-election the Prime Minister promised to remove exemptions that relate to LGBTI students, but, sadly, as yet we have failed to achieve that goal. I would really like to see this parliament act on that before the end of this year. We know there has been cross-party support on this issue, and there's no reason it should not be progressed and actioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked about these issues when I tabled the committee report on legislative exemptions. We saw the evidence from the committee and LGBTI organisations, and from faith based institutions, strongly indicating that religious schools do not use these exemptions and do not want them. In fact, we had very detailed discussions. Well, what is it that enables you to uphold a school's ethos? Do you go away relying on exemptions in an antidiscrimination act? No: you have a strong and lively culture within your school and religious community that promotes certain values. It's not written down in exclusive clauses in the Sex Discrimination Act that exclude people as some kind of exception. That is a ridiculous way of upholding religious freedom in this nation. What I find so strange is that when we talk about religious freedom there is no right in this nation to have your own faith or other political belief protected as an individual freedom. I've heard many of those from the other side talk about this. Rather than the belief that you hold, or not being discriminated against for holding that belief, there are some in these debates who are intent on trying to express their religious freedom by upholding a right to discriminate against others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'm sorry to say, that is not, in my view, how freedom in our nation should work. By that very statement, when you discriminate against others and harm them in some way, you are impinging on their freedom. I wouldn't want to see any teacher discriminated against in our schools for holding a particular religious belief, any more than I would want that to happen to them for having a particular sexuality or gender. I note, for example, that if you are a religious school then you might want to uphold a religious belief in your teachers, but it shouldn't be that hard to explain, within the strong school ethos that many schools have—and they don't go out of their way to rely on exceptions in the Sex Discrimination Act to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does Senator Bernardi mean when he says 'the increasing attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms'? Our duty in this place is indeed to strengthen freedoms in Australia when they are for all. It is a quality of access to various freedoms, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, sexuality, union affiliation, political belief or any other attribute. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  This is a debate about traditional freedoms. As my record shows, the Liberal Democrats always defend the full range of freedoms in the Western liberal democratic tradition. Other parties might defend freedoms selectively, but they shirk from the task of defending freedoms that unpopular groups rely on. Other parties say that they defend freedom of religion, as we do. But only the Liberal Democrats believe that a school should be free to refuse enrolment to gay children or to expel them. Why would a parent want their gay child enrolled in a school that thinks their child is an abomination? Expulsion from such an abhorrent school would be a blessing and shouldn't be banned. Freedom of association is a fundamental freedom, but only the Liberal Democrats have supported the rights of motorcyclists to join motorcycle clubs, rejecting the lie of guilt by association. A right to a fair trial is fundamental, too—but only the Liberal Democrats support the rights of accused perpetrators of child abuse or domestic violence to a fair trial. Two bills that undermine justice for these people are due to sail through the Senate this week—opposed, presumably, only by me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being innocent until proven guilty is also under attack. I have not heard anyone, other than the Liberal Democrats, consistently rail against regular reversals of the onus of proof and the application of strict and absolute liability. Property rights are fundamental, but only the Liberal Democrats fight against unexplained wealth laws that seize the wealth of people who have not been convicted of a crime. Traditional freedoms have been routinely attacked under the guise of national security. Freedom of movement of those who are not facing any charge is constrained through control orders and, more concerningly, through preventive detention. And our privacy is undermined by government surveillance of our communications as if we are all just criminals in waiting. When I defend our traditional freedoms against attacks under the guise of national security, I cut a very lonely figure because parties that pretend to stand for freedom are missing in action. We also see retrospective laws in tax and migration that pull the rug out from under people. Some parties might defend migrants, and some might defend taxpayers, but only the Liberal Democrats defend both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I turn to freedom of speech. Other parties selectively defend freedom of speech but only the Liberal Democrats are consistent and comprehensive, with four weighty bills before this parliament to light the way towards free speech. Free speech is fundamental to our democratic society and a key part of what makes life enjoyable. Importantly, it doesn't mean you are under any obligation to politely listen to what others have to say. 'Traditional freedoms' means all the freedoms I have raised today; it's not just a particular freedom that my political base or any other base might like this week. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to truly stand for freedom in this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Bernardi, congratulations on initiating this debate on freedoms generally and on what you say are increasing attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms. I've had the good fortune in my life, as a member of this parliament, to visit many places in the world. I attend, as a regular member, the Inter-Parliamentary Union that meets around the world somewhere every six months. I always come home absolutely amazed that, in Australia, we have a confected outrage of abuse of the human rights of Australians and abuse of our freedoms and a confected victimisation that a few people in this country continue to support. I think about other countries I've been to, and I'm so grateful that I am an Australian living in a country which is as free as any civilised nation can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The old freedoms—freedom from want, freedom of religion, freedom of association and freedom of speech—are things we cherish in Australia. Sometimes we mess up on them—and I'll mention a few of those—but, by and large, we are a country that should cherish and celebrate the freedoms we have as a nation. At the Inter-Parliamentary Union, there are some countries—who claim to be parliaments—who will not allow this international gathering of parliamentarians to even discuss some issues, let alone pass any resolutions on them. There are some fellow parliamentarians who attend this who I know execute people who have committed crimes which, if committed in Australia, perhaps wouldn't even draw a mandatory jail sentence. One of the reasons I like going to the Inter-Parliamentary Union is that I look around and say, 'How lucky am I to be an Australian and living in this country of absolute freedom.' There are some abuses on the way, but they don't overcome the reputation that Australia has, rightly, as a country that cherishes, values and promotes the freedoms we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on a perhaps more negative note, I was very disappointed today that Senator O'Sullivan was pilloried by other senators in this chamber, accused of doing a number of things, and sought leave to defend himself, but the leave, which is required in this chamber, was denied by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate. That is un-Australian, and it is an abuse of freedom, because in Australia, as in all democratic and free countries, the basic tenet is that when you are accused you have the right to a defence, you have the right to explain your action, and you have the right to show that you are not guilty as charged. But that was denied this day in this parliament, in a parliament that is supposed to be protecting our freedom to speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of our universities—I say with some regret: the university that I always support, James Cook University, and other universities in this country—have denied various people access to their campuses for meetings because they disagreed with what that person might be going to say. I too would perhaps have disagreed with what that person was going to say, but, as the old adage goes, I disagree entirely with what that person says and stands for, but I defend to death the right of that person to express their views. So I'm disappointed that the universities, which are supposed to be the bastions of freedom around the country, are only selective in the freedoms they allow with speakers on topics which those in charge of the universities don't believe are appropriate for discussing on their campuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted, having just returned from being an observer on behalf of Australia at the Fiji elections, to see how freedom in that British colony is continuing to operate. They have had some rocky patches along the way in the last couple of decades, but their election system, which is the basis of all freedoms in a democratic country, was, in my view, absolutely brilliant—without peer, I might also say—and executed excruciatingly honestly and fairly. Considering the freedom of elections and the freedom of democracy in Fiji and the way it was organised, I lamented that unfortunately in Australia these days we don't have quite the same precision in the conduct of our elections. For example, in the electorate of Herbert, which was won by the Labor Party by 37 votes, there were 200 cases of double voting, which could have changed the government of Australia. That could never happen in Fiji because in Fiji, once you've voted, you put your finger in an inkwell of indelible ink, and for the next month everybody knows you have voted. If you turn up at a polling booth to vote again, as often happens in Australia, I'm aware, you won't be allowed in. So there is a lot we could learn from the Fijians about how to conduct an election that does in fact guarantee our freedoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst talking about freedom, can I just give a shout-out to those who protect the freedoms we so enjoy in Australia. Our police forces are sometimes under criticism and pressure for not following the rules, but they fight against people who never follow the rules, and they do a wonderful job. I have the greatest admiration for the police forces, our law enforcement agencies around the country and our intelligence services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to do a shout-out for our Defence Force. I come from a garrison city, the city of Townsville, which is the home of Australia's largest Army base, a significant Air Force base and some naval elements as well. Our troops, our soldiers, our service men and women, are the ones who ultimately defend the freedoms we accept as the norm in our country. Very often they are recognised, but too often they are not. They do a wonderful job in protecting Australia, and that means protecting what Australia is all about—protecting the freedoms that we enjoy. A strong Defence Force that is motivated to defend the country, the culture and the freedoms that Australians have and expect to continue to have is just a wonderful exercise. They do a wonderful job, and, as often as I can, I will offer praise, congratulations and thanks to the serving members of our Army, Navy and Air Force who protect Australia in so many ways and do it so professionally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bernardi, in sponsoring this matter of public importance, has concerns about increasing attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms. He mentioned those in his speech, and my colleague Senator O'Sullivan also explicitly raised a number of these issues where there are attacks from within, almost—from people with political ideologies—on the freedoms that we've always enjoyed in this country. In that regard, I support the approach of Senator Bernardi and Senator O'Sullivan in lamenting those attacks by some within Australia—as I say, usually of a political bent—on some of the freedoms which we class as traditional, relevant, important and part of Australia. Mr Acting Deputy President, we are in the lucky country because of the freedoms we enjoy. Long may that continue.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator JACINTA COLLINS:</span>
                  </a>  I too would like to thank Senator Bernardi for proposing this matter to be discussed today. Following Senator Macdonald, as I am, can I reflect on a couple of elements of his contributions as well. We are indeed in the lucky country, so I thank him for adding that element of perspective to this discussion about reports of increasing attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms. I think we should take pause as to the sensationalising of these matters in the way in which some people have done. I am not at all suggesting that Senator Macdonald is one of those. I think his points about us being in the lucky country are very important for us all to reflect upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Macdonald also raised the matter that occurred here earlier today. As a sidenote more than anything else, to ensure that this is on the record, I should highlight—as indeed did Senator Macdonald, if I recall correctly—that Senator O'Sullivan had the opportunity to seek leave to make a personal explanation. He didn't do so, but he did then cover the matters concerned during the suspension debate. So it's not that Senator O'Sullivan did not have an opportunity to defend his circumstances, but I think we would all do well to reflect on how formal business in the Senate is currently being conducted and, indeed, how it is considered by those outside of the parliament observing our behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, I would like to concentrate my remarks now on the issue of religious freedom, which is one of those things that I think many would regard as traditional freedoms. In Australia, of course, we've had a fairly unique heritage in how we reflect religious freedom, which in recent times has been highlighted as inadequate if you look at international standards and conventions on how we should protect religious liberty. With that background, it's useful to note some of the reporting today that a clear majority of Australians, both Liberal and Labor voters, back new laws to prevent individual schools and companies from being discriminated against because of their religious beliefs and practices. The front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today reports a Newspoll that shows 59 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of new laws to protect people with religious beliefs, compared with 26 per cent of those who oppose them. Even Greens voters overwhelmingly support strengthening protections, with 63 per cent saying they favoured change, compared with 50 per cent of One Nation voters—supporters, I should say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this Newspoll tell us in the context of this debate? It shows that the support among all key political parties is running in favour of legislating stronger protections for religious freedoms. While respecting and supporting the importance of people's religious beliefs, Australians do not support discrimination. We are, as Senator Macdonald said, the lucky country. We have this ethos of a fair go. That is why this parliament supports the recommendations of the Senate inquiry into discrimination-free schools and associated matters, in its report tabled yesterday, to remove the exemption in section 38(3) of the Sex Discrimination Act, which currently allows faith based schools to discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Although this has not been used for this purpose by faith based schools, times have changed, and it's appropriate and right that the laws are updated to reflect those changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why some religious organisations are concerned at changes which still occur without the broader issues relating to religious liberty being addressed. One of the reasons for that, I suppose, is that this government kicked down the road the issue of religious freedom when the parliament dealt with same-sex marriage. Senators will recall that former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, when confronted with difficult issues over how that legislation should deal with religious freedom, kicked those issues down the road with the Ruddock review. Those senators, particularly in the coalition, who might have been inclined to act at the time on those matters essentially removed their support, and there was going to be no change. Of course, we're still waiting for the Ruddock review report quite some time later. Now we have other issues because of a leaked report of the Ruddock review's recommendations, without the considerations or the discussion that might have led to those recommendations. So we have a second issue that Australians are being asked to address in relation to discrimination issues in schools but still no Ruddock report to help guide us in how we should adequately cover religious freedom in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I think most faith based schools say they think the historical exemptions are not really the way to proceed in dealing with these issues, they are obviously reluctant to have the exemptions removed, and quite fairly so. The Ruddock review has not been disclosed—the government hasn't dealt with those issues—and these schools are being asked to operate without the exemptions and without other arrangements to address that void. This is why I say these Newspoll figures that I highlighted are particularly interesting. The Australian public at large is saying: 'Fix it. Act on it. Do it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the particular problem that the current government faces just now. The stagnation at a federal level with respect to dealing with policy across a broad range of areas is creating a lot of harm. It's creating harm and uncertainty in our schools at the moment. This is why Labor calls on the government to release the Ruddock report and to respond to the public call for change and reform here. The type of posturing that's occurred from some in the coalition on these issues, I regret to say, was once again reflected in the dissenting report, which was tabled yesterday. The dissenting report, at point 3 on page 57 says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This committee has not been established to undertake an examination of the substantial issues raised by this question in good faith.  It has been hurried in a way that exposes its true purpose:  to provide a platform for some Labor and Greens Senators to project their pre-determined views onto a larger stage, for their own political advantage. Those involved should be condemned for doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat in the Senate in that last sitting week and watched government senators join the Greens and limit the time frame of this inquiry. I questioned them in the chamber at the time: 'Why are you doing this?' I got no satisfactory answer there, and now I think it deserves to be exposed that those very same senators are saying in their report that this inquiry was rushed. It was rushed because they voted for it to be rushed, and to suggest that this is on Labor's head is simply outrageous. This is once again posturing by some members of the coalition, thinking that they can delude members of the community on something the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> tells us, 'They know what they want, and it's time we got our act together to do it.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's platform has, for many, many years, indicated that we should act to reinforce religious freedom in Australia. That is Labor's platform position, and that is the position that is represented in the majority report of the committee, which was tabled yesterday. Recommendation 5 says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that consideration be given to inserting in law a positive affirmation and protection of religious freedom in Australia that is appropriately balanced with other rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about time we did it. Release the Ruddock Report and stop stalling.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the increasing attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms. I know a lot of people in this place like to deny it, but there are an ever-increasing number of attacks on Australia's traditional freedoms. Whether that is our freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to have a laugh, the right to celebrate the holidays you want to celebrate, equal rights for parents, the right to a fair go—and I could go on—these traditional freedoms are under attack. Many Australians feel like they are experiencing a cultural invasion as our schools, universities, government departments, political parties, media and even major corporations are overrun by a rabid new left-wing ideology often referred to as cultural Marxism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have many Australians tell me they no longer recognise the towns where they grew up. They feel like they are losing their country and their way of life. They are worried they won't be able to give their children or their grandchildren the same standard of living they had. Australians are worried about this and they are right to be worried. If we keep going down this path, we will no longer be able to call Australia the Lucky Country or the land of the fair go. That's why One Nation has been such a strong supporter of the traditional Western values that made Australia the greatest country on earth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day One Nation's leader in New South Wales, Mark Latham, announced a policy designed to protect Australia's traditional freedoms and address the very issue we are debating here today. Let me read you some extracts from the New South Wales One Nation policy for uniting Australians as one nation. There is a section on defending individual freedom that says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We hear a lot about 'minorities' in politics, but the smallest minority in any society is the individual. One Nation is committed to defending the rights of the individual. We believe in judging people by their personal character and work ethic, by their contribution to Australia and Australian values. We believe in talking honestly about these issues, free from the suffocating PC-censorship of the identity-Left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One Nation strongly opposes the Left's attack on personal freedom, its attempt to control society by controlling our language, feelings and behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy also talks about stopping segregation and discrimination, arguing that we are losing one of the best things about our country: the sense of fairness and the great Australian tradition of rewarding those who work hard and seek self-improvement. The Left used to argue that racism and other forms of discrimination were plain wrong. Now they practise them against straight white males. They have created new forms of discrimination, supposedly to overcome old forms of discrimination—a self-defeating strategy. This has inevitably produced bitterness, division and unfairness in our society. It is also entrenching the evil of segregation, separating Australians from each other on the basis of race, gender, sexuality and religion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is even a section on reforming human rights law, a subject I know One Nation's New South Wales leader, Mark Latham, is very passionate about. It reads in part as follows: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reforming human rights law … requires a fundamental rethink of human rights law at State and Federal level. New policies are needed to bring Australians together and restore fairness to our public and civic life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The job of government is to adhere to the constitution, rule of law and the economic stability of the country. It is not their job to tell people how to run their businesses or their lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  There is nothing more vital to a liberal democracy such as ours than protecting the freedoms on which it was built. Freedom of speech, one's ability to speak freely and frankly without constraint, is central to all other freedoms. Freedom of speech is likened to other fundamental freedoms such as freedom of religion, thought and conscience. It is a fundamental tenet providing for open and honest political discourse—discourse about things like radical Islam, black African gangs, opportunistic economic migrants and the Aboriginal industry. These are some of the issues under the egregious 18C where mums, dads, university students and news presenters have been hauled before the courts as a result of offence taken from something that someone has said. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was taught that offence is taken, not given. A lot has changed from when I was young, and not for the better. Without open discussion, free from fear of retribution, as a society we will never address these issues. We will never close the gap. We will never stop the ever spiralling crime sprees by disaffected African youth and we will never stop the rising threat of radical Islamic extremists. In the eternal words of George Orwell, if liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. However, every day we see instances of the Left and radical Greens shutting down debate and stifling political discourse. People in this chamber continually deny me and other conservatives the right to debate issues that we are passionate about. This is a sad indictment of our democracy. If we cannot have freedom of discourse to discuss important issues in this place, then where on earth can we? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Like elsewhere in the world, Australia has experienced rapid growth in commercial and recreational Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) use in recent years. The potential of RPAS to change the way in which Australians approach everyday tasks is significant, as they can reduce the cost and risk associated with hazardous, difficult or time-consuming work. There has already been a significant uptake in industries such as the media, emergency services, agriculture, mining and scientific research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the importance of regulating the RPAS industry to ensure the safety of the public, RPAS pilots and other airspace users. However, this regulatory approach must be proportionate to risk and encourage growth in the sector now and into the future. If regulated appropriately, the emerging RPAS sector will contribute significant productivity and efficiency gains to the Australian economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">At this stage, the Government does not consider that the current international research supports the need for an immediate redraft of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations Part 101 relating to RPAS below 2kg. The introduction of CASA's legislative instrument (<span style="font-style:italic;">Direction</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">operation of certain unmanned aircraft) </span>in October 2017 has already provided stronger, clearer and tightened safety rules for recreational RPAS users. The new rules include a requirement that operators must not fly their RPAS over or near areas affecting public safety or where emergency operations are underway, and not within 5.5 kilometres of a controlled aerodrome.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">All RPAS users, unless approved otherwise, must adhere to the prescribed standard operating conditions, including not flying above 400 feet, not flying within 30 metres of people and operating within line of sight to the RPAS.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Airservices is in discussions with several providers who have RPAS detection solutions. These products may provide real-time statistical activity information in and around airports, supplementing Airservices current reporting capabilities. Airservices intends to conduct a trial with a provider during the 2018-19 financial year, with an aim to gather data and develop knowledge on how this technology might be integrated and to better understand the current limitations of the technology.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">BITRE will now undertake a similar arrangement to compile statistics for RPAS, noting however that a complete list of all RPAS owners or operators would need to exist in order to identify participants in any future survey.

Under this regime, enforcement bodies would be delegated powers to provide on-the-spot fines and report infringements of the regulations directly to CASA.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  This is a continuation of my speech in the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2016. When I was speaking previously on this legislation, I made it clear that we do not support this legislation because it would basically create a separate family violence framework for people seeking asylum in this country and for migrants to this country. I referenced the Australian Law Reform Commission's 2011 report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Family violence and Commonwealth laws</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—Im</span><span style="font-style:italic;">proving legal framework</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s,</span> and noted that that report considered issues around regulating sponsorship and that the department of immigration submitted to that inquiry that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such measures could lead to claims that the Australian Government is arbitrarily interfering with families, in breach of its international obligations. It could also lead to claims that the Australian government is interfering with relationships between Australian and their overseas partners in a way it would not interfere in a relationship between two Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Law Reform Commission concluded that, rather than instituting a separate criterion for sponsorship, the safety of victims of family violence can be promoted through targeted education and information dissemination. The Australian Law Reform Commission also concluded that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… because of concerns about Australia's international obligations, as well as procedural fairness and privacy, sponsorship requirements should not be altered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to point out that partner visas form part of Australia's family migration stream, which allows noncitizens to enter and remain in Australia on the basis of their spouse or de facto relationship—and that is both opposite and same-sex—with an Australian citizen or permanent resident. It's also worth noting that submitters to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill noted that the bill has the potential to interfere with Australia's human rights obligations in regard to the right to family—specifically, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the Australian National University's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, which stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge that the provisions are intended to prevent people from entering into relationships where there is a risk of family violence. However, we submit that such decisions ought to be made by the individuals themselves, rather than by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council submitted to that inquiry that the proposed amendments had the potential to discriminate against families on the basis of national or social origin or other status where one partner is a noncitizen. Their submission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no equivalent law that requires partners who are either citizens or permanent residents to have their partner's criminal and personal history assessed before they are granted the right to live together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, when the Department of Immigration and Border Protection previously addressed this matter, they concluded that measures such as those contained in this bill could lead to claims that the Australian government is arbitrarily interfering with families in breach of its international obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be very clear that the Australian Greens are very supportive of legislative measures that address family violence, and we're also very supportive of significant extra funding going into addressing family violence in this country. We make the point that the shockingly high number of women who are killed—murdered—in this country by a violent male partner or ex-partner ought to be raising this issue prominently in the minds of every senator, and it ought to lead to far more significant investment by government into services that support people who are suffering from family violence. So we very much agree that family violence is a critical issue in this country, and we urge the government to do more than it already has to provide support for people who are suffering from family violence. However, we share the concerns of organisations like the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance and the Law Council of Australia, who all raised valid concerns about privacy and procedural fairness. They also noted the risk of punishing victims of family violence by jeopardising their chances of accessing a visa and highlighting the lack of evidence of any support being available for those people who did come forward as family violence survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, Senators, the Australian Greens believe that everyone should be treated equally in this country, whether your ancestors have been here for tens of thousands of years or for a couple of hundred years, or whether you arrived yesterday as a person who is seeking asylum in Australia or as a migrant to our country. We all ought to be treated equally under the law, and we, in the Greens, as senators would know, are big strong supporters of the rule of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the provisions in this bill, although they are intended to prevent people from entering into a relationship where there is a risk of family violence, we firmly believe that these decisions should be made by the people themselves, not by the government. Yes, the government has a role in the provision of information, and yes, the government has a role in the provision of education and other supports. But, fundamentally, decisions about who to enter into a relationship with should be left to the people who are considering entering into a relationship together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also provides the framework for the temporary sponsored parent visa program that the government announced in the budget. The new visa category will allow Australians to sponsor their parents to stay in Australia for up to five years at a time at a cost of $10,000. This new category is in addition to the existing parent visa categories. What we have here is yet another visa category for people who are wealthy enough to afford it. This is one of the big problems with the way this government runs the visa system in this country and the legislation that frames up the visa regime in this country: there are certain visas that are only accessible if you have enough cash to pay for them. That includes special investor visas but it also includes this new visa category.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family reunion for people who've migrated to this country is critical for the maintenance of family ties and family connections. It's worth the Senate knowing that it can cost over $100,000 to bring two parents to Australia under the contributory visa program. If you don't have the $100,000, there is the option of a non-contributory visa. But the Department of Immigration and Border Protection website currently advises:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">If you are a new applicant for a Parent (non-contributory) visa, your application will be queued and you can expect to wait approximately 30 years after your queue date until visa decision.</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />Let's be very clear about what is going on here: if you're wealthy and you want to bring your parents to Australia, you can go to the top of the queue; if you're poor and you want to bring your parents to Australia, you have to wait for up to 30 years to reunite your family, 30 years to be able to see your parents again. I've got news for some senators. There are many, many people who want to be reunited with their parents and bring their parents to Australia to reside who haven't got 30 years because their parents will be dead in 30 years. But if you've got the cash you can go to the top of the line. Again, there is one rule for the well-off but another rule entirely for the not-so-well-off. The waiting list for the non-contributory parent visa is so long that people often die while waiting for their visas and without having had the opportunity to spend significant time with their children and grandchildren. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgraceful situation in this country that we allow this to happen. The Australian Greens are determined to play a role in enforcing our country to do better and in making sure that people who want to can reunite with their parents—migrants to this country who want their parents to come here so that they can be with their grandchildren and so that their kids, who are often of working age, can support them through the later years of their life. We want to see that made more easy for more people. We don't want to see 30-year waiting periods where, in some cases, parents die before their visa applications are even considered by the department. That is unfair and an absolute travesty. The Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia believes that high entry charges for migrants who want to live in Australia are inequitable and fundamentally overlook the importance of Australian society. The Australian Greens agree. The ability to bring your parents to Australia to live should not be limited to only those who have the financial means to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth noting that, for people who came to Australia as refugees, it is even more difficult to sponsor family members, particularly if you are a refugee who arrived by boat. Of course, that is the combined policy-cruelty lock step that is engaged in by the LNP and the ALP in this place. Together they believe that if you arrive in Australia by boat and seek asylum then you ought to be exiled to places like Manus Island and Nauru. There are people on both Manus Island and Nauru who are about to clock up six years—six years in limbo, six years of lost life, six years of danger, six years of inadequate medical support, six years of indefinite offshore detention designed deliberately to destroy people's hope—and we are seeing the inevitable price being paid by innocent people on Manus Island and Nauru, including children: the inevitable mental illness, the inevitable trauma and torment that innocent people are suffering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current approach by government unfairly disadvantages refugees in reuniting with their families. It's worth pointing out that reunited families offer stable support networks for refugees and humanitarian entrants, and we should be doing more as a parliament to make sure that people, including refugees, can be reunited with their parents. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a comment by Dr Anna Boucher from the University of Sydney, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the proposed five-year visa is described as temporary, it is also renewable, so parents could end up living out the rest of their lives in Australia on a series of temporary visas. They would be, for all intents and purposes, permanent residents, without any of the rights of permanent status, remaining outside the welfare safety net and wholly reliant on family for care and assistance. They would be living in a democracy but denied political representation and the right to vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the record the submission by FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia, to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection regarding the temporary visa for parents:</span>

We have to do more to reunite families of people who have been exiled to either Manus Island or Nauru and have lingered there for nearly six years now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  At the outset, I indicate that Centre Alliance supports the main objective of this bill, the Migration Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2016, to combat violence and abuse in the sponsored family visa program. We have waited a very, very, very long time to debate this important piece of legislation. It's been well over two years since this bill was introduced, and this is the second incarnation after the first version lapsed with the previous parliament. Its delay shows that this government does not rate family violence high enough on its agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses an oversight in the current law where there is very little, if any, focus on the character of a sponsor or the responsibilities that are attached to sponsorship. The sponsorship assessment and visa application are currently lumped together, which this bill seeks to separate. This bill will ensure character checks of the sponsor are conducted before the visa application can be made and that the findings are shared with the person they are sponsoring, so, importantly, they are aware of what they're getting into. At the moment sponsors are required to agree to undertakings of financial support and accommodation for up to two years. But those undertakings, unbelievably, are not enforceable and there are also no penalties whatsoever for noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with this approach from a family violence perspective is self-evident. There is no question that newly arrived migrants are among the most vulnerable people in our community. They are heavily reliant on their sponsor, are less likely to have an established support network of family and friends and are less likely to know where or even how to seek assistance if things go wrong in their private life. In many instances, their grasp of the English language may also be quite limited, which further compounds their isolation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a particular powerlessness that comes with being a victim of domestic abuse in a new country. Can you imagine wanting help but not knowing what services exist or who to turn to? Imagine having dependants—the decision to seek help might become even more difficult. How can you be confident that authorities will respond to your situation in the way you need and won't take your children away from you? Even if you're brave enough to reach out, you have a very real worry that, if you leave your abusive sponsor, you risk being sent back to your home country. This bill, covered with regulations introduced last year, seeks to circumvent this situation by requiring approval of sponsors. There are requirements for police checks; providing newly arrived family members with information about essential services and emergency contacts; statutory obligations on sponsors; and penalties for failing to provide agreed support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that there have been questions about whether this bill strikes the right balance. The brief Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, held more than two years ago, unearthed some important considerations. It's fair to say that the handful of stakeholders that provided evidence during the very much short-lived inquiry either opposed the bill or supported the government's policy objectives but expressed concerns about how those objectives were being addressed in this bill. The main area of concern that they centred on were visa processing delays; the separation of family units; issues of privacy; concern about procedural fairness and the government interfering with these families in ways it wouldn't domestically; and the perception that visa applicants are being punished for the conduct of their sponsors. There is also the possibility that a spousal refusal alone will not necessarily result in the end of an abusive relationship but rather an application for a different type of visa. While my colleagues and I are concerned about the issues that have been raised by stakeholders, it is our position that these need to be weighed against the policy intent of the bill and the effectiveness of the measures being proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of safeguards, it's important to bear in mind that the minister will have the discretion to refuse sponsorship applications in limited circumstances only. Those circumstances will include cases where the sponsor has convictions for sexual abuse or violence against children. This type of offending is especially heinous, and visa applicants ought to be entitled to know if their sponsors have offended. We note that, even where the sponsor has a criminal conviction, a decision by the minister to refuse or approve sponsorship would take into account a range of factors. These include the length of the relationship with the visa applicant, the type of offending by the prospective sponsor, how recently the offending occurred, the relevance of the offending to the family relationship and any mitigating circumstances. Applicants would also be entitled to natural justice and have access to a merits review of any refusal by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to bear in mind that the bill does not seek to remove the family violence exception from the current act. The bill takes those existing protections one step further and provides additional preventative measures. According to the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection, in 2016-17, 540 partner visa applicants sought to remain in Australia under family violence provisions. My office knows of one such case involving a woman who moved to a remote country town in South Australia with her partner, who she met online. From the moment she arrived in Australia, her partner sought to exercise power and control over her, and the woman became completely isolated. The marriage was extremely short lived and ended when the injuries that this woman sustained at her husband's hands resulted in her being airlifted out of town for emergency medical treatment. She was forced to live in a refuge and struggled to come to terms with the fact that she'd left behind a happy life in her home country, surrounded by loved ones including her only son and grandchild, only to fall victim to family violence in a foreign land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in the majority of cases women are the victims of family violence. We also know that in Australia at least one woman is killed every week as a result of such violence. According to KPMG, who undertook a study for the Department of Social Services, the cost to the Australian economy of violence against women and their children is estimated to be well in excess of $22 billion a year—a staggering number, particularly when you consider that family violence is severely underreported by victims. And that's just violence against women. Men are also victims. One in three people who experience violence from a current partner are male, and males are two to three times more likely to never tell anybody about the violence. Males are also excluded from government antiviolence programs despite making up a significant proportion of victims of family and sexual violence. As we know, children are also victims. But, even when they are not themselves assaulted or abused, they suffer severe trauma just from witnessing domestic violence—seeing a beloved parent be abused and feeling powerless to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The long-term impact on the victims of family violence, whether they are women, men or children, is extremely profound. If this bill results in one less case, it is very much worth supporting. Indeed, it is incumbent upon us to do more to protect vulnerable individuals. Whether or not this bill strikes the right balance between protecting vulnerable people, on the one hand, and overcoming the concerns that have been raised by stakeholders, on the other, remains to be seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very real possibility that the bill will only capture the tip of the iceberg in terms of family violence because the bill only addresses those sponsors who have convictions for the offences outlined earlier. It does not address those individuals who have a history of violence with multiple partners but don't have any convictions. We know that this area of law is very problematic, especially for women, who are often pressured into not pursuing charges against their intimate partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that I propose to move an amendment to review the operation of the bill 18 months after its introduction. Specifically, the review will consider the extent to which the new provisions strengthen the integrity of the family visa program and improve the management of family violence in the delivery of the family visa program. If the concerns that have been raised by stakeholders do eventuate, that at least will provide an opportunity to consider further changes to the family visa program where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, there is some suggestion that the family violence exception is difficult to establish. When this bill was first introduced, my office raised the issue with the minister's policy advisers, who indicated that four out of five family violence claims are accepted by the department. Based on the advice provided, it would appear that, in practice, family violence applicants are given the benefit of any doubt. Only a very small proportion of the claims made are rejected, and this is done on the advice of an independent expert. This is an issue that I will continue to keep an eye on and raise as part of the review into this bill in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also briefly note that the government has used this bill as an opportunity to make a completely unrelated amendment to introduce a new class of temporary parent visa. This visa will allow parents to stay in Australia for five years at a time, to be renewed only once, as long as they hold private health insurance while here and their sponsor agrees to pay all health and aged-care costs. We are prepared to support this amendment on the grounds that members of the community who have faced long delays in sponsoring parents are interested in having more options for parent visas. However, I should caution that in supporting this amendment we do not want to see the provisions that make this visa possible, such as the extension of the debt recovery function to family sponsors, exploited for other visa classes such as partner visas and child visas. We would also expect that the government will maintain annual places in the existing parent visa classes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I thank my fellow senators for contributing to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to strengthen provisions to prevent family violence within visa programs. It builds on the work the government has already undertaken to provide information in the form of a predeparture pack to support visa applicants coming to Australia that clearly states that family violence is unacceptable in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key element of this bill will be to put in place a framework that will require a sponsor of a family stream visa to be assessed and to be approved before a visa application can be made. In addition, it will require sponsors to agree to the results of their character checks being shared with the persons they are sponsoring so that they can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with their application or not, especially in circumstances in which children are involved in the application. These amendments are an important part of the government's initiative to ensure that women and their families are safe from violence. The amendments support and deliver on important elements of the Second Action Plan in the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. In summary, I believe that the bill deserves the support of all senators, and I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the following observations. On 21 June 2016, the government made a commitment to introduce a new sponsored temporary visa for parents of Australian children. This new visa arrangement will allow parents to visit their Australian children without imposing an additional burden on Australia's healthcare system. In order to implement this new sponsored visa, there needs to be an assessable sponsorship framework for family sponsored visas. The Migration Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2016 will amend the Migration Act 1958 to introduce this framework. When the bill was first introduced, the framework was intended to apply to the partner program first and the rest of the family program later. The sponsorship arrangements for the new parent visa will now be introduced first. To ensure that the sponsorship framework covers the requirements for the new parent visa, as well as all family sponsored visas, the bill requires government amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the new parent visa does not place any additional burden on Australia's healthcare system, the Australian child will be a financial guarantor for their parents' health costs. This amendment will allow a legal bond arrangement for approved family sponsors so that the obligation of liability for outstanding public health costs can be enforceable by a relevant health service provider. These providers will typically be state or territory government organisations but may also include aged-care facilities. The sponsored parent will be required to cover all of their own health debts incurred whilst onshore. They will also be required to hold adequate health insurance from an Australian health provider. If the sponsored parent does not cover their own health costs while they are in Australia, the sponsoring Australian child will be liable for the outstanding debt. Importantly, these debt recovery functions are currently only intended to apply to sponsors of parent visa holders and are unlikely to be extended to sponsors of partner or child visa holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new sponsorship framework is designed to separate the sponsorship application from the visa application. This means that the sponsor will need to be approved as a family sponsor prior to lodgement of a family visa application. If there is information known that would indicate a possibility that a sponsored person will be subject to family violence, the sponsorship application can be refused.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I indicate that the Labor Party will oppose the government's amendments. It appears that the amendments to assign financial responsibility for health costs go far beyond the government's stated objective in applying to temporary sponsored parent visas. If we just look at the explanatory memorandum itself, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the hour, I won't go into the full detail of our objections, but the fact remains that while this was an election commitment—or the government claims it was an election commitment—it is two years since that election and, when you look at the detail of what the government is proposing, it is not consistent logically or practically in terms of how these measures will actually work. For those reasons, these measures would be unfair and unreasonable to migrant communities. Given the lack of consultation with migrant communities about these matters, the Labor Party won't be able to support them.</span>

But that is clearly not the important issue tonight. What I am concerned about is that the residents of Bunbury have long been concerned about significant discrepancies in petrol pricing. They are paying more to fill up in Bunbury than residents in other major centres of the south-west of the state. They pay more in Bunbury than in smaller regional towns—regional towns, frankly, right across the country. Not unreasonably, Bunbury residents have an expectation that they should not have to pay more than people who live in communities of comparable size and circumstance. We have the residents of Bunbury just wanting a fair go on what is a very significant cost impost. We</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">ve all seen petrol prices grow around the nation in recent times, but for the Bunbury residents it has been even more so.</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Bunbury is 150 kilometres from Australia's only oil refinery. How is it that there is such a discrepancy in the costs? Transport is not the issue; it is the market and price gouging in this local community that are at play here. We know that high transport costs act as a barrier to employment opportunities and economic productivity. The statistics from the ABS in 2016 show that a greater percentage of those employed in Bunbury were reliant on their car to get to and from work than in any other electorate in Western Australia; 71½ per cent travelled by car to work, and a further seven per cent travelled as a passenger in a private vehicle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a region that has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state of WA, and we should be doing all we can to minimise barriers to employment. People in Bunbury understand why regional people pay more for petrol than those in the metro area do, and they do not have an expectation of price parity. However, it is absolutely unfair that they are paying more than other regional towns, often much further from the refinery and with lower population, and with much less local competition. Over previous years, various inquiries have compared petrol prices in regional centres with those in the cities and have only rarely compared prices between regional centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the greater Bunbury community, who rallied together to back this petition. This petition, while assisted by Don Punch, has been a real community effort, and I commend the petition to the Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  As I rise to give my adjournment speech in the Senate tonight, hundreds—possibly thousands—of Tasmanians will be gathering on the lawn of Tasmania's parliament to celebrate the Tarkine in the north-west of Tasmania, one of the world's last wild, fully accessible wilderness areas. The rally will be celebrating a petition—the biggest petition on environmental matters in this country's history, with 252,000 signatures from around Australia and indeed internationally. This petition has been pushed by both the Bob Brown Foundation and international clothing company Patagonia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many reasons that we want the Tarkine protected under World Heritage protection. One of those reasons came to parliament today in the form of a tourism forum that visited Parliament House and walked the corridors of power to talk to decision-makers about the need for $20 million in federal funding for a trans-Tarkine track. This was a group of 15 small businesses—15 passionate tourism operators. I certainly enjoyed spending my time today with Greg Irons, the owner of Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, one of the key attractions in the south of our state. Greg is also one of the operators of Tarkine Trails, an ongoing business, and has been walking the Tarkine for over a decade. And Greg and his wife and his team do wildlife rescue. He was telling me today that they have saved nearly 8,000 animals this year. A record number of injured animals have been brought to the wildlife sanctuary. Greg's up here today working with 15 tourism operators to get the ear of federal politicians for $20 million of federal funding for what will be one of the world's great walking experiences—a 10-day track that will cover the Tarkine. It is a large area, and the track can be broken up into two separate walks of five days each, with camps set up for walkers. We believe that it will rival the Overland Track, which is one of the world's great walks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, although the Tarkine is absolutely one of the most precious jewels in Tasmania's crown, it is unprotected. Only a very small area was protected by the Labor government in 2012, and nearly 550,000 hectares that have been valued under National Heritage listing for both their ecological and their cultural values remain open for mining and logging. We believe that the area has huge potential to generate employment and income for Tasmania and for Tasmanians if it is protected, if it is given the certainty for the investment that's needed to provide a world-class tourism experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the Tarkine area, in the north-west, which spans all the way down from Wynyard to virtually above the west coast in Queenstown, a massive area, gets one of the state's lowest visitations. Whereas Cradle Mountain, nearby, gets one of the highest visitations, this area receives between five and seven per cent of the state's tourism visitors, who tend to go to other locations. It is absolutely one of the most stunning, rare, wild places that's accessible to Tasmanians and to visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Tasmania is already rated both in Australia and internationally as one of the world's most iconic walking destinations, but this provides a viable alternative. This has already been scoped with a $100,000 feasibility study, which was raised through crowdfunding. We've had a demand study done. This project is a goer. All it needs is federal assistance, and then we have the potential to develop a significant economic asset for north-west Tasmania, an asset that will bring people through, not just to do the walk and experience our wilderness—and, of course, those people will all go away converted to wanting to save World Heritage—but also to spend their money in the region. They'll go to local restaurants, wineries and hotels. They'll buy other produce. They'll tell their friends, and they'll all come to Tasmania. This is a win-win. It just needs some leadership. And it was great to see, in Canberra today, a delegation of small businesses so passionate about promoting Tasmania and what it has to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge senators who haven't been down to the Tarkine to go down there this Christmas, go for a walk, and see for themselves what I'm talking about. Visit the rainforest. It is an absolutely stunning mixed species rainforest. It's on the world's last wild river areas. It is amazing cultural and ecological heritage and, of course, has some of the world's best surf beaches. So it's got everything on offer. All it needs is a ticket down to Tassie. Don't go to MONA straightaway and don't necessarily go to Cradle Mountain or Freycinet straightaway—much as they're fantastic. Go visit the Tarkine and see for yourself. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I'll begin tonight by noting for the record, following Senator Pratt's contribution, that fuel in Puma petrol stations in Perth on FuelWatch this evening is 139.7, and Puma fuel in Bunbury tonight is 140.7. I don't think that is a dramatic difference. I know that the local federal member for Forrest, Nola Marino, always does a great job of looking out for her electorate with regard to cost-of-living pressures, which this government is doing so much to try and address and which those opposite wish to exacerbate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I rise tonight to speak about the Liberal Party candidate for Fremantle, Nicole Robins. Nicole is a remarkable individual, 28 years of age, a high school maths teacher and a science graduate from Murdoch University. At such a young age she has 10 years of experience in local government, and I think that is a remarkable achievement. She's been resident in Fremantle for most of her life and is a great champion of that electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She began her journey into politics in the City of Melville Youth Advisory Council in her teenage years. This inspired her to run for council—I believe at the age of 19—and she has succeeded since then in being elected as a councillor, including to the position of deputy mayor. She sits on the Governance Committee of her local government and on the Financial Management, Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee. As I said, she served as acting mayor for a period. This is fabulous experience and is what makes Nicole such a wonderful candidate for the Liberal Party in the seat of Fremantle. She's involved in youth work in the electorate in the City of Melville and volunteers for a youth program. She's also been appointed to the Kardinya Primary School board. Nicole is a great advocate of diversity. She is a great representative for her electorate and would do an absolutely wonderful job if elected to the seat of Fremantle at the next federal election, whenever that may be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, in the brief time I have remaining, I also want to note Australia's involvement in the Mars landing earlier today. There was only one Australian involved in this project—a scientist currently working at Curtin University in Western Australia, Dr Katarina Miljkovic. This is quite a remarkable achievement. She worked on the InSight lander which touched down on Mars today. This research obviously expands our outer horizons as a people, and it gives us the chance to understand a completely different world in a way we haven't been able to do before. I congratulate her efforts in working on such a groundbreaking project and wish the Mars lander all success into the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  As someone who grew up in country coastal New South Wales, I understand the importance of being connected to other communities. Today, this means making sure that regional Australians have good access to high-quality mobile coverage. If you aren't connected, it's harder to get a job; it's harder to stay in touch with family and friends; it's harder to keep your small business afloat; and it's harder to contact emergency services in times of trouble. It is deeply concerning that, in 2018, many regional locations have little to no access to adequate mobile coverage. Inadequate mobile coverage creates social isolation. It limits the economic benefits of tourism and can put people's lives at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's response to addressing mobile connectivity issues in regional Australia has been completely inadequate. It is not just Labor saying this. The ANAO report into round 1 of the government's program said the program was not meeting community priorities. In the electorates of Page and Gilmore, in New South Wales, locals are calling for a better deal when it comes to mobile coverage. Across the Page electorate, there are over 90 identified mobile blackspots. That means there are towns, suburbs and businesses with limited or no mobile coverage. Yes, this is concerning. The Summerland Way links Casino and Grafton. There is little or no mobile coverage along much of this critical transport corridor. It creates a dangerous hazard for motorists, tourists and emergency services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's mobile blackspots plan has been plagued by delays, with the Productivity Commission stating that there is 'a risk that the Australian government funding is directed at expanding mobile coverage in locations for political reasons rather than to locations where overall community wellbeing might be better served'. Labor's candidate for Page, Patrick Deegan, has been calling on the government to fix the blackspots, with hundreds of locals signing a petition to put an end to bad coverage in their community. Fixing mobile blackspots across the Summerland Way should be a priority. We have to fix these to improve connectivity, motorist safety and emergency response times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Gilmore, on the New South Wales south coast, is a tourist hotspot, and that places seasonal demands on the Princes Highway. Mobile blackspots on this critical transport corridor create a dangerous hazard for motorists, tourists and emergency services. We know that, in emergency situations, almost 70 per cent of calls are made from mobile phones. The government's inaction on addressing this issue leaves the community frustrated and, frankly, isolated. Labor's candidate for Page, Fiona Phillips, has been listening to the people of Gilmore, and they are raising concerns about the lack of coverage on the Princes Highway. Hundreds of people have signed her petition calling on the government to fix the highway blackspots. Fixing the blackspots along the Princes Highway should be a priority to improve community connectivity, motorist safety and emergency response times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands the importance of ensuring that all communities have access to quality mobile coverage. We are committed to investing in regional communications by completing and improving a first-rate NBN. We've also committed to strengthening regional communications by improving mobile connectivity. Labor supports a public program for co-investment by government to address mobile blackspots. We've committed to work with state governments, local councils, businesses and emergency services on regional connectivity plans to deliver better outcomes. We'll implement strategies to make use of existing infrastructure, such as light poles and fibre optic networks, and to encourage the sharing of infrastructure. Ten years ago only 10 per cent of Australians had no home line. Now there are approximately 6.7 million mobile services in use and around 31 per cent of Australians have no fixed landline at home. We need to do better. We need to ensure that mobile blackspots are addressed to meet community needs and to prioritise emergency service needs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  What do you think of when you think of Australia? The vast stretches of our outback, our magnificent beaches, our incredible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their culture? Beautiful Sydney Harbour with its iconic Opera House and bridge? Cosmopolitan Melbourne with its trams and laneways? Uluru, the Great Barrier Reef, the Twelve Apostles, the rainforests of the Tarkine and Daintree? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia conjures up many iconic images and ideas, but one I haven't yet mentioned is our wildlife. We have unique wildlife. Kangaroos—iconic; emus—iconic; platypus, wedge-tailed eagles, rainbow lorikeets, galahs, magpies, blue-tongue lizards, frillneck lizards, dingos, echidnas, wombats, Tasmanian devils—all iconic. Koalas—absolutely iconic. So it's startling to know that the iconic koalas, along with 447 other Australian animals, are threatened with extinction. This is not only sad; it's also preventable. You may ask why we are leading the world in species extinction. The answer is clear. It's the actions of this government and state governments around the country, on top of the actions of past governments, that have got us to this crisis point. Our governments are standing by and allowing native forests to be logged, overwhelmingly for wood chips, letting land be cleared for agriculture, property development and highway upgrades, allowing the clearing of forests for coal seam gas development and doing nothing about climate change except changing leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Koalas are unable to survive as their homes are lost. Once their homes are lost, koalas suffer stress, disease, dog attacks and vehicle strikes. Koalas are being wiped out during the breeding season. They are found in supermarkets, on railway lines and up electricity poles looking for homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent study of US tourism found that the two things that tourists to our great country wanted were to visit the Great Barrier Reef and to see koalas in the wild. But in the near future the only place they'll see koalas is going to be in zoos. Our koalas are hurtling towards extinction. They are in major decline across almost all of New South Wales, and no population estimates have been undertaken since 2006. Not surprisingly, this means we've got big inconsistencies between population counts. The New South Wales state government count says we have 36,000 individuals, while the federal government's estimate for New South Wales is 21,000. Both are woefully and worryingly low, given historic populations, but they are almost certainly both underestimates, given the stresses that koalas have been under since 2006. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South-East Queensland, the heartland of koalas in the state, there's an almost 80 per cent loss of habitat for development. The government refuses to even monitor koala numbers. The major parties, regardless of who's in government, have refused to legislate for habitat protection. They have presided over a system where compliance with our environment laws is inadequate, where our environment department has had its funding and staff slashed, where the differences in populations of koalas across regions and states are ignored, masking the need for urgent action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's climate change. The head-in-the-sand approach of the current government hangs koalas out to dry. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists koalas as one of the ten species most vulnerable to climate change. Almost all of New South Wales and Queensland is suffering severe drought. Drought doesn't just affect our farmers and regional communities; it also affects our wildlife. Drought means that the eucalypts that koalas rely on can't provide them with the water and nutrients they need to survive. Female koalas can't cope with pregnancy or nourishing their joeys. Add these factors to habitat destruction and you can understand why populations are in serious decline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our koalas must be protected from land clearing and deforestation, logging and climate change, so we need environment laws and an environment department that actually work. It's astounding that a country as wealthy as ours is robbing future generations of their chance to know and love our precious wildlife, like the iconic koala. When will the Labor, Liberal and National parties sit up and take notice? We need action now—not in five years; not in 10 years. We need action that has to start now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Next month, it will be two years since the shortwave service was removed for people in northern Australia. For the people of the Northern Territory, it has been deeply felt in terms of the absolute silence of communication, for our cattle stations, our ranger groups, our fishermen and fisherwomen working on the seas in the north, and also the Aboriginal communities across the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shortwave service is an enormously vital service. We do not have the access to telecommunications, to mobile coverage, that the rest of the country has the luxury of receiving so quickly and so adequately. So, for two years, the people of the Northern Territory, of far northern Queensland, of far northern Western Australia, and even further afield, on our seas, in the Pacific, have heard silence or static where once they would have received the news and the weather—critical information in times of flooding, in the wet season, with cyclones coming thick and fast in northern Australia. That's the critical need. It's not a luxury; it's a service essential for survival. We need to have the shortwave service flicked back on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been no improvement to communication since the ABC was forced to cut shortwave. We've had a Senate inquiry. We've had appeals and petitions from across the country urging the federal government to maintain funding for the ABC so that critical services like shortwave would not be cut to those Australians who desperately need to have that information. The VAST service is not adequate for people on cattle stations who go mustering; they can't take that kind of equipment on the backs of their horses. People can't take it on the backs of their boats as they're fishing, in terms of their own produce. We've had the Northern Territory Seafood Council, the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory and the ranger groups pleading continuously for nearly two years to have shortwave switched back on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm enormously proud of the work of my colleagues here—in particular, our shadow cabinet and Stephen Jones, the shadow minister for regional communications. He came up to Alice Springs last week to work with Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari, and Luke Gosling, the member for Solomon, and me, to announce that Labor will want to see shortwave flicked back on, and that, if we are elected, $2 million will be allocated to shortwave. I'm enormously proud of that. And I certainly hope that that is something we can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I call on the government and on those senators who know the importance of this, on Senator McKenzie and Senator Scullion, who know the passionate need for this service: you can do this now—you can flick that service back on. It is vital to our remote and rural regions of Australia. Come on. You can do it now. Give the people of the north the Christmas present that I know they would greatly appreciate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Violence against women is at epidemic levels in our country. Every year we count the numbers and every year they're distressingly high. Last year 53 women were killed, mostly by men known to them. So far this year, 63 women have been brutally murdered, almost six women every single month. Where is the outrage, where is the urgency and where is the change? November 25 marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and it's also the start of 16 days of activism against gender based violence, a time to come together and take serious action to end violence against women and girls around the world. The 63 women we have lost this year—I wish we didn't know their names; I wish their faces had never been plastered over the news. It is because their lives were brutally cut short and because of their tragic ends that we know who they are. That should never have been the case. According to Destroy the Joint's incredibly important and no doubt extremely difficult work, Counting Dead Women Australia, these women ranged in ages from 15 to 92, and they came from all corners of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fatima Batool was killed by her husband in Hampton Park, Victoria on 7 July, with her young daughter in the house at the time of her murder. That same day, just a few kilometres away, Amanda Harris's body was found stabbed and burnt in a house set alight. Thirty-six year old Amanda was a mother of three. 16-year-old Larissa Beilby left her home in Sandgate, Brisbane, on 15 June. Police found her body wrapped in a tarpaulin in the boot of a vehicle on the afternoon of June 27. A 34-year-old man has been charged with her murder and multiple other offences, including torture. For all the statistics that we do have, we know that the true extent of violence against women remains hidden. A domestic violence incident is reported to police on average every two minutes in Australia, and for every woman who comes forward to make a report, there are dozens in the shadows who aren't able to come forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that we all share a commitment to ending violence against women in this place, yet each year we count the numbers. Enough is enough. It's painfully obvious that we need to do much more, that this government needs to do much more. Victims and survivors who do reach out rely on a system that is desperately underfunded and overstretched. In the federal government's housing and homelessness funds, not a single cent has been set aside to fund women's refuges. And, as it does so often, the federal government has thrown up its hands and decided that this, again, is a state and territory matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a dangerous shortage of services for survivors of domestic violence all over the country. The work of the feminist movement that built women's refuges is being eroded at an alarming pace. Governments are refusing to build new women-only refuges and adequately fund specialist services. When I talk to frontline workers, they tell me of a desperate shortage of space in refuges. Too often, they have to turn women away, or ask them to leave the refuge before they are ready to leave, because they just don't have enough beds. At a time when women, some with their children in tow, have taken the brave step to walk away from violence—at not just a vulnerable but a dangerous time in their lives—the very least governments can do is to provide a safe place and much-needed support at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This may be a hard truth for some to confront, but Australia has a shockingly horrendous record on domestic violence. The fundamental reason for violence against women is the vast inequality between genders, misogyny and the oppressive patriarchal system that we live under. There's no hiding the fact that, unfortunately, we have senators in this very chamber who want to roll back the gains that women have made over many decades, senators who would rather talk about 'men's rights' than discuss the violence women face in our country. There's no more pretending that domestic violence doesn't exist. For far too long, impunity, silence and stigma have allowed violence against women to escalate. Let's not stay silent anymore.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I rise to speak of the experience of people who have been required to use jobactive services whilst looking for work. Since September there's been a Senate inquiry into the appropriateness and effectiveness of the jobactive program, and that has heard from a lot of witnesses. But tonight I'm not going to speak about the evidence we heard there. The Senate committee will report on that hearing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I want to talk about the experiences that I have heard about from people who have contacted me directly, have made contact through Facebook or have come into my office, and these are constituents from Western Australia and from around Australia. Many of these people speak about their 'demoralising' or 'horrendous' experiences—and I'm quoting what they've said to me using those two words—in a system they feel is 'broken'. This is a program that is affecting the mental health of participants by causing unnecessary distress, anxiety around meeting unrealistic expectations, humiliation and depression. One participant noted: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The whole situation made my mental illness worse than it has ever been before, and pretty much killed my chance of ever really working from how much it has heavily worsened agoraphobia with panic disorder. The system is corrupt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In their <span style="font-style:italic;">Voices of unemployment</span> report, ACOSS surveyed 311 jobactive participants regarding their experience in the program. Of these participants, 65 per cent felt their jobactive consultants were not equipped with the training or skills required to offer any valuable assistance and were lacking in empathy or lived experience of living in poverty as an unemployed person. People have consistently told me of the frustration they feel working with their providers, the conflicting advice they often receive and the lack of support offered. One person commented on my Facebook page:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The system is completely broken and nobody has a clue what they're doing: This morning I was sent a message that I was suspended as I did not hand in my job search paperwork … I have not dealt with anyone on a one-to-one basis and have just been dealing with the receptionists manning the front desk … bad luck if I needed to speak with somebody privately. They've offered no funds for training and done absolutely nothing … The whole system is a complete joke. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACOSS report found that 73 per cent of the survey respondents were dissatisfied with their jobactive provider. Many noted the lack of assistance being provided and, where training opportunities or workshops were offered, they were inappropriate and inadequate. An overwhelming 79 per cent of respondents claimed that they would prefer to tackle the job market alone than continue working with their provider. Another commented on my page:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I was with Max [Employment] in my late 40s they tried to tell me how to do a resume. Hello! I've been updating it for the last 30 plus years. They also sent me on a week-long course to help me work out the right kind of work for me which lo' and behold was exactly the kind of work I have over 3 decades of experience in. They then tried to force me to go to a job interview which was a work from home call center type role and when I said I couldn't do those hours as after school care closes at 6 they told me to lie and tell them that I was available and to just not answer any calls while I made the mad dash to pick up my son.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In their report ACOSS noted that 59 per cent of caregivers felt that their providers did not adequately take into account their family duties and regularly scheduled appointments at inappropriate times and often found jobs too far from home or involving night shifts. This inflexibility and insensitivity towards participants in caring roles has caused considerable distress to many. I have also heard how single mothers, in particular, are having to juggle parental responsibilities with their children with the demands of their providers. Participants also tell me of the increased levels of stress and anxiety they face manoeuvring through the system, which is confusing and overly complicated. If they have one slip-up, they face having their payments suspended. If they decline a job offer that is not suitable for their skill level or physical capacity, they risk being suspended for four weeks. Many do not understand, or have the resources to assist them through, the bureaucracy of the system and the appeals process. Many people, in fact, do not even know about the appeals process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that the rate of Newstart has not been increased in 25 years. Many of these people are living in poverty. They are living from payment to payment, quite literally. When their payment gets cut off, that's a meal they can no longer afford or a rent payment they can't meet. What we are hearing is that jobactive providers are suspending payments within hours or, I've heard, in less than an hour. The process now means that they have to report within a very short space of time after somebody has 'missed an appointment'. I've heard many reasons why people have missed an appointment and not been able to contact the provider, and their payments have been suspended. While the jobactive provider has very little discretion, in fact I've been told that they're not even using the discretion that they may have when they're considering reasonable excuses. People are just being suspended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are even hearing evidence from people that their payments are suspended when the provider has missed their appointment:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I had a phone appointment … on Friday at 11.15 am. I asked her previously if I was to call her or if she would call me. She claimed I would call her, which I did at exactly 11.15. She wasn't available and I left a message. I now find that my payment has been suspended for not attending the appointment! … I am 57 years old. I am trying to get on my feet by working for myself and using my skills as a potter to get off centrelink payments … I do everything that is required of me and I do not deserve to be treated like this. No one does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a program that is supposed to be helping people. It's supposed to be supporting jobseekers into meaningful employment. This is a program that is supposed to alleviate the stresses of unemployment by making clearer the path into work. There's an Employment Fund supposedly to help people with training and other things that are needed to try and overcome the barriers to work. Yet time and time again I hear from people that providers don't want to spend the money. I hear from people that it's too complex to get access to those funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What people are telling me personally is that this program is failing. It is not supporting them into meaningful work. They are going out and finding their own jobs. This program is not supporting people. It is not helping people to find work. It is leading to people having extreme anxiety and stress about the process. It is adversely affecting many people's mental health and making them feel helpless and hopeless. That's how people articulate to me how they feel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve a strong social safety net that looks after all of us when we are out of work, when we are on hard luck and when we are vulnerable. The Australian Greens will continue to fight for changes to this broken system to ensure that all Australians have access to the support they need when they need it and have proper support and training to help them find work in the circumstances that they are facing, with services that are particularly focused on their needs. So we should have services that are tailored for young people, services for people that are genuinely job ready and services that support older Australians to find work. That's the sort of individualised approach that we need and that unemployed Australians, and vulnerable Australians who are facing barriers, deserve. This system does not work. It's a top-down, very punitive, compliance-driven approach which the evidence clearly shows is not working for those people that truly need these services. It needs to be fixed properly, not with bandaid approaches.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  I rise to speak on an important issue of national significance, Australia's engagement with India. In April last year, the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced with great enthusiasm that the former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and former High Commissioner to India, now University of Queensland chancellor, Peter Varghese AO, would be commissioned to study and prepare an India economic strategy. The opposition welcomed the idea and its chosen author. Indeed, Mr Varghese is highly respected among many in the Indian economic and trade communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Varghese report was released publicly in July this year. At 514 pages in length, the report charts a pragmatic, ambitious and confident course for Australia's future engagement with India. It represents a truly exceptional body of research. The Turnbull government subsequently welcomed the report, and Labor announced our support for its key recommendations. But then the government buried it. Indeed, in my questioning in Senate estimates, the government admitted that it had been sitting on the report since April this year. On Friday last week—some seven months later—only after continuous pressure from Labor, and with the recent visit from India's President, His Excellency Ram Nath Kovind, did the Morrison government endorse the report and provide in-principle support. But we still have no substance from the government, and those opposite still have no coherent India strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of my colleagues and stakeholders are aware, as a person of Indian origin and as an Australian senator, I am a long-time supporter of the Australia-India relationship. In 2015 I was honoured to receive the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, the overseas-Indians award for building friendlier relations between our two nations. It was conferred by the then President of India, His Excellency Shri Pranab Mukherjee, and it was indeed an honour. But this importance of Australia's engagement with India cannot be overstated. If we do not move quickly, Australia is at risk of losing out to other countries that have already recognised the myriad opportunities that India will bring in the coming years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern Australia and India share a common heritage and—as His Excellency President Kovind said during his visit to Australia last week—a special bond. But, as Australia has shed its colonial links, developed its own culture and economy and may soon, I hope, become a republic, India similarly bears no resemblance to what it was under the British Raj. It is an economic superpower in the making and, indeed, a republic. As Mr Varghese observed, India is changing, driven by the politics of aspiration. His Excellency President Kovind fittingly declared last week, 'We are running and soon we will be galloping.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard, the numbers speak for themselves. India is now the world's fastest-growing large economy. It is the third-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity and it is the largest democracy in the world. By 2025, one-fifth of the world's working-age population will be Indian. In the next 10 years, India's five largest cities will have economies comparable to that of middle-income countries today. Within the business sector, sales and earnings growth among Indian companies are noticeably higher than their Australian counterparts. Over the past five years, India's stock market has seen greater performance than the ASX. Inbound foreign direct investment has increased by 19 per cent each year over the past 20 years, and India's trade has increased from 13 per cent to 40 per cent of GDP. And there is considerable room for India to maintain that rapid economic ascent. Its mean age is only 27, and 90 per cent of its workers are still engaged in the informal economy. Against that backdrop, the government of India is seeking to upskill some 400 million of its citizens, moving them from the informal economy and expanding the country's secondary and tertiary industries prowess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Mr Varghese observes in his report, there is no market over the next 20 years which offers more growth opportunities for Australian business than India. As Australia's engagement in India has considerable room to grow, our shadow minister for trade, Jason Clare, observed last Thursday, when speaking at the AFR India Business Summit, that, to date, Australia hasn't been hungry enough. He also rightly observed that Varghese's report is potentially as important as the one Ross Garnaut produced for Bob Hawke's government almost 30 years ago on North-East Asia. The reality is that our trade with India is comparable to our trade with New Zealand, a country not even 100th of India's size and with a quarter of the population of Delhi. While 19,000 Australian companies export to New Zealand, only 2,000 export to India. Over the past decade, Australia's exports to China have quadrupled, but our exports to India have remained stagnant—indeed, dropping by a quarter between 2010 and 2016. Varghese's report makes the pragmatic estimate that the opportunity exists to expand our export market from $14.9 billion to as much as $45 billion over the coming decades and for our investment in India to rise tenfold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report emphasises that our economies are complementary. As India continues to advance to become the world's most populous nation and the third-largest economy, it will need more of what Australia can develop and has developed to provide a competitive advantage. In this respect, the report identifies 10 core sectors—in particular, education, agribusiness, resources, tourism, energy, health, financial services, infrastructure, sport and science and innovation—where Australia is well positioned to succeed. Beyond complementarity, the potential that India presents to improve our economy's security cannot be overstated. At a time of increasing uncertainty in the international trading system, we need to take steps to add balance and reduce our international trade risk, but developing a deep, sustainable economic relationship capable of producing increasing and long-term benefits for both countries will not happen if left to market forces alone. Government support is required, and the current government is nowhere to be seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, Labor has committed to supporting the report's 10 key recommendations and more, including holding annual Australia Week in India trade missions, following Mr Varghese's India Economic Strategy, working with the Indian government to establish a reciprocal internship program to allow recent Australian graduates to help build the Asia business capability of young Australian professionals, and implementing a future Asia strategy to immerse ourselves further into the Indo-Pacific region and make Australia and the region more secure. Labor's commitments will address not just the report's economic strategy but also the geopolitical congruence and people-to-people ties, which the report stresses must also be improved to achieve success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Indian diaspora now numbers near 700,000, tripling over the past decade. One in 50 Australians was born in India—more than any other OECD country per capita. In my time as a senator of Indian origin, I have engaged actively with the diaspora at key Indian festivals, attending Diwali events in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and my home state—all over the country—and seeing the growth and the opportunity to spread multiculturalism through those festivals. I think that we need to create a more meaningful relationship that can improve social utility and mobility, create jobs and foster opportunities for people in both countries, and indeed the region, to live fulfilling lives. This report needs to be commended.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:14</span>):  Most parties sound unhinged when they list their achievements. There is generally no consistency, and when you look at what they brag about you see a mass of contradictions. One day they support liberty; the next day they oppose it. One day they support balancing the budget; the next day they want to spend a heap of money with no consideration of how to fund it. Trying to make sense of their claimed achievements is an exercise in confusion, and that's if the achievements actually exist and are not just statements of intentions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Democrats don't have that problem. Our achievements are all consistent with our small-government principles. In two previous speeches I have described some of our achievements. I will now describe some more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government was rushing to introduce a tax on backpackers, which is now robbing our agriculture sector of casual labour, I negotiated to introduce a bill to prevent the publication of the names and addresses of employers who hire those on working holiday visas. I also negotiated crossbench support to ensure the bill passed. Because of me, unions cannot simply look up the personal details of farmers planning to hire backpackers, so farmers are not exposed to union harassment. Also, as part of the backpacker tax negotiations, I stopped the ATO passing the private financial information of employers to the Fair Work Ombudsman to enforce minimum wage, penalty rate and award wage compliance. Private tax information should never be used for industrial relations purposes. These two commitments are reflected in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, which is now law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to representations from taxpayers who stood to lose a lot of money, I convinced the government to delay the retrospective clawback of a small business capital gains tax concession, giving people time to adjust their affairs. I always oppose tax increases, but I also oppose legislation that imposes retrospective obligations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I gained the communication minister's commitment to allow online poker services to operate within Australia. Online poker is a very popular and also a very low risk form of gambling and should never have been included in the ban on online gambling. The government has not yet followed through on this, and I am continuing to apply pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I helped expand the circumstances in which you can withdraw your own superannuation under the government's First Home Super Saver Scheme. If you lose your home because of a divorce settlement, for example, you can still be eligible under the scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of my support for a ban on corrupting benefits to union officials, I successfully moved an amendment to remove a reverse-onus-of-proof aspect and to prevent the government being able to widen the ban by decree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, there was a bill that required foreign owners to report their ownership of water rights so that a register of such foreign ownership of water rights could be published. I amended the bill to require the Productivity Commission to hold an inquiry within three years into the costs and benefits of the register and the associated imposition on foreign investors. The amendment also requires the Productivity Commission to make recommendations on the issue. That's now visible in section 34A of the Register of Foreign Ownership of Water or Agricultural Land Act 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, I established the Senate Select Committee on Red Tape to inquire into the effect of restrictions and prohibitions on business—in other words, red tape on the economy and community. The committee has examined some of the most egregious examples of red tape sector by sector. It has considered and reported on the sale, supply and taxation of alcohol; tobacco retailing; environmental assessment and approvals; pharmacy rules; health services; child care; occupational licensing; private education; and policy and processes to limit and reduce red tape. I'm very proud of the committee's work and firmly believe its analysis and recommendations will form the basis for future policy development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to mention something that's perhaps my most enduring achievement, something that's close to my heart and perhaps something that I might benefit from personally in future years. I refer to saving Anzac Rifle Range for sporting shooters. Soon after I was sworn into the Senate, I began to investigate the situation regarding the New South Wales Rifle Association and its tenure on Anzac Rifle Range. I had long known that the range was owned by the Commonwealth and that previous governments had attempted to kick the shooters off. I knew the Commonwealth had lost two court battles but had, nonetheless, evicted all the shooting groups apart from the Rifle Association itself. What I didn't know was that the government was continuing to harass the Rifle Association in an attempt to force them off by attrition. I realised not only that I should something about it but also that, despite vague words of support from some coalition members, nobody else was genuinely interested. Labor was hostile to the range, and the state Shooters and Fishers Party had decided years ago that it was a lost cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the Rifle Association to get up to speed, and I found out which government department was responsible. It was Finance. I established that the Rifle Association was willing to move to another location but, after fighting the government in court, was in no position to pay for a new range. And nor should they have to, because they'd done nothing wrong. So I went to the finance minister and told him I thought the government behaviour was unconscionable. I pointed out that the shooters would leave voluntarily if they had somewhere to go and that the government could sell the land for hundreds of millions of dollars. At my request, the finance minister visited the range, bringing the secretary of the finance department with him. There were discussions about alternative locations, and it was agreed the situation needed to be fixed. Then the Prime Minister of the time, Tony Abbott, gave a commitment that the land would not be sold. That settled it. A secure lease was drafted with a clause which ensured the shooters could be required to leave only if the government provided an equivalent facility somewhere else. A term of 25 years, plus 25 years option, was approved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Anzac range has been used since the 1850s. There are 60,000 or more recreational shooters in Sydney, and the range is central to the future of the shooting sports in New South Wales. I am very pleased to have played a significant part in securing its future. There are many other achievements I could mention, but I would need another one or two speeches to cover them, and, of course, more needs to be done. Taxes and government spending remain too high. Red tape and nanny state regulations continue to put a straitjacket on Australians going about their business. But some progress has been made and, with more Liberal Democrats elected to the Senate, we can achieve much more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, Forrest Primary School, with the dedication and commitment of three of their class teachers, Carolyn Davis, Dan Heap and Sarah Bauer-McPhee, worked with the grade 6 graduating class of Forrest to look at the issues around the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This was an opportunity for the young people to bring in their knowledge, passion and suggestions for action for their students, staff and families about what the SDGs meant to them, to their community and to their world. I was lucky enough to visit the school a few months ago in the middle of their research program, and I was absolutely astounded by their energy, their commitment, their research skills and the efforts they made to learn more about the SDGs and also the way that they really got the message. They understood that the SDG agenda was definitely about their world and about ensuring that no-one was left behind. They also saw that, while there were 17 goals—and each one in that class could tell me each of the 17 goals—they had to work together. So last Monday Forrest Primary School came to their Parliament House to give evidence to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee inquiry into the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The whole of the main committee room was full of over 60 students from the school. They came to talk with their parliament about what they had been doing and to put into action the messages that they wanted to give, not just to their families and friends that were able to visit their presentation, but to all of us, to show that the parliament had a role to actually commit, as they have done, to the SDG agenda. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some of the contributions that we received as a committee. Senator McGrath is over there. He was able to listen to the school with Senator Gallacher and myself. The conversation started with Miles, who started his contribution by asking us how we would feel if we had to drink water that wasn't clean. His group had looked at the importance of water in our lives. They learnt about the impact of the fact that across the world more than 2,000 children die every day from unclean water and diseases associated with inadequate water supply. They talked about the 2.3 billion people who don't have sanitation such as toilets. They looked at goal 6, which looked at clean water and sanitation. They researched the process, and they took action. Remember, the idea of the baccalaureate program is to take action. Miles and his team decided that the Molonglo River, which runs through Canberra, was not as clean as it should be. So they went out together and did a clean-up in their river and took rubbish out of the water that is running through the city of Canberra. They understood there had to be an understanding of what clean water is all about and the importance of it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then other students from the school came forward. The presentation from Honey was looking at the issues around the goal 11, building sustainable cities and communities. She talked about how important all the goals were in this place. She also challenged all of us. It's important for young people to have the knowledge and power to change the world so that they can lead by example and inspire. They know that through their exhibition the school community can do more. Ava talked about her team and SDG3, which is about health. She talked about the importance of immunisation across the world. Their focus group looked at the problem of good health and wellbeing. Without that there would not be a future for anyone in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eloise talked about goal 15, which is life on the land. She encouraged her schoolmates and family to think about the issues of poaching in Africa and people who were poaching rhinos, elephants and tigers. She was telling people what that would mean for the future of wildlife and how we could protect animals. Senator Rice was talking about that earlier in Australia. They made that link. Phoebe's group looked at SDG1, poverty, focusing on poverty and homelessness. She was working with her team to look at having a donation box on the day of their exhibition to raise money for the homeless in Canberra and linking that into homelessness for young people in South Africa. Caterina and Ruby talked about SDG12, responsible consumption and production. They talked about the impact of plastics in the community and urged other students to try and limit the way they use plastic. Ruby talked about the action they took to make canvas bags, decorating those with messages, which then could be sold, reinforcing the need for looking at alternative ways to consume but also raising money for the project, which was looking at poverty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Claudette's team took on a biggie. That was one we talked to Senator McGrath about: SDG16, peace, justice and strong institutions. Claudette was looking at the issues around corruption in government. They thought that there was not a lot they could personally do at the moment about this issue, but they could raise awareness and raise knowledge about the importance of having integrity in government. Edgar was all across the issues of SDG7, affordable and clean energy, looking at how people can save energy and how we can use appliances better and look at natural light and upgrading appliances. Ava Rose was looking at life below waters in SDG14—again, that overwhelming issue of plastics. She set up a store with her mates at Coles in Manuka, talking with communities about what this meant. She was saying that people wanted to talk to them about what they were doing. Dylan also looked at life below water and how beautiful the ocean can be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Max looked at decent work and economic growth. He raised awareness for younger people with a game he invented so that it was unbalanced: if you had money and wealth, you always got ahead. If you were disadvantaged and poor, you kept losing the game, using a dice, and you just could not break that nexus of privilege. Eliott was talking about reduced inequalities. They had a stand at the exhibition which showed that, if you were rich and privileged, you were able to be listened to with respect, you had comfortable chairs and your opinions were valued. If you were not rich—if you were one of the disadvantaged, if you were poor, if you had been left behind—your opinions weren't taken into account and you weren't looked after. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They ended their exhibition day with a dance. All the students got involved and they had a dance which represented the issues they'd been discussing. They also suggested maybe we could use a dance program here in parliament when we are looking at important issues. That might actually lift the level of debate that we sometimes have in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adelaide is going to come back and talk to us later. She is going to put her own submission in about the issues around gender inequality, talking about how, often across our world, women are treated differently to men, and making sure that those inequalities are identified and that real action is taken. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These young people get the message of the SDGs. When 2030 Agenda ends, they will be 24 and they'll be making decisions about the future of our planet. We heard today about the activism of students. I think Forrest Primary School has put this activism into place. The inspiration that they provide and the challenge they provide to us make it clear that they expect their government to be deeply involved in these processes. They have told us that the SDGs are important, they're real and they can provide a plan for us into the future. I hope people get the chance to read their evidence in full in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of our inquiry. It's people like the young students at Forrest Primary School that can lead us into a better future where no-one is left behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:32</span>):  National security, the protection of our people, our sovereignty, and our democratic system of government, must always be a top priority for government and for the parliament. Unfortunately, however, political figures are often tempted to twist national security for political advantage. Ambitious bureaucrats can also exploit security to build empires, with little concern for the dangers an excessive concentration of state power may pose to democratic institutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, cynically sought to exploit a tragic knife attack by an alleged extremist and the arrest of three other terrorist suspects to try to bully this parliament into passing his controversial encryption bill before Christmas without full scrutiny and debate. The minister is absent from the parliament this week owing to an injury, but that hasn't stopped him from renewing his demands that parliament pass this legislation in this sitting fortnight, even though the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, is yet to complete scrutiny of the bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Encryption is undoubtedly a significant and growing problem for our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. However, very serious concerns have also been raised by IT companies, and security and privacy experts, that Mr Dutton's bill will effectively open back doors that may systematically compromise internet security, including the services used by Australians every day. These concerns cannot be swept under the carpet. And I acknowledge that the security agencies may differ on that perspective. Moreover, if the encryption legislation really is an urgent priority for the home affairs minister, as he claims, he would have introduced this bill into the parliament months earlier. This isn't the first time that the minister has used exaggerated rhetoric and dire warnings to push a political position. Not so long ago, he claimed that Melburnians were too scared to go out to restaurants at night because of African youths street gangs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National security issues require careful and mature consideration and a measure of circumspection, not politically driven appeals to prejudice and division and fear. There can be no short-circuiting of the parliament's duty to carefully and methodically scrutinise the executive government, especially the powers and the work of our security and intelligence agencies. I was pleased to hear the Labor opposition signal last week that it didn't want scrutiny of the encryption bill rushed. Yesterday the PJCIS reaffirmed its inquiry schedule, with further hearings today and on Friday. However, Labor hasn't always been robust in resisting coalition demands that controversial national security legislation be pushed through without proper debate. In June, Labor joined with the government to ram new espionage and foreign interference laws through the Senate in a single day. There are now some signs that Labor might agree to rush an amended encryption bill through the Senate, with powers to compel IT companies to break encryption initially limited to national security agencies. However, such a proposal would not address the serious systematic issues involved. As Labor senator Jenny McAllister noted yesterday, cutting short the PJCIS inquiry would risk unforeseen consequences without proper scrutiny. This must not happen with the encryption legislation next week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In due course the Australian people, and particularly the electors of the division of Dickson, will have their say on Mr Dutton's future as a minister and as an MP. There will also be an opportunity for a new government to look again at the organisation of our security intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The creation of a Home Affairs portfolio is very much Mr Dutton's signature achievement. He also owes much to his energetic, empire-building departmental secretary Michael Pezzullo. Having security, law enforcement and border protection agencies in a single portfolio had been long debated but lacked strong support from policing and security experts both within and outside government. A homeland security department was seen as unnecessary given the excellent coordination and communication between our intelligence and police agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than a few observers looked askance at the proposed concentration of the investigative and coercive powers within a single portfolio ultimately responsible to one minister. Professor John Blaxland, of the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, a former Defence intelligence officer and official historian of ASIO, argued that a new super ministry was, at best, inadequately justified and, in many ways, seriously flawed. Blaxland described the creation of the home affairs department and the transfer of ASIO and the AFP away from the Attorney-General's portfolio as 'a fraught move that would demolish well-tested arrangements for a high degree of healthy contestability concerning intelligence judgements and operational options'. Blaxland warned that the new arrangements were more about politics than substantive fact based organisational reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Dutton's portfolio is now all encompassing, including, as it does, the new department, ASIO, the AFP, the Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. The department itself, effectively a ministry of state security, has grown like topsy and taken on many new responsibilities, often without scrutiny or debate. For example, although the investigation of foreign political interference is a matter for ASIO and the AFP, and the Attorney-General's Department has responsibility for establishing the new foreign influence transparency regime, Home Affairs has appointed a new Counter Foreign Interference Coordinator, heading two new branches to counter alleged interference in Australian politics by foreign powers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One might reasonably question the wisdom of Home Affairs reporting directly to Minister Dutton to delve into political affairs without statutory safeguards that ensure the apolitical and highly professional work that we normally see from ASIO and the AFP. More broadly, there are serious concerns about the paramilitary culture that Mr Pezzullo has instilled in the Australian Border Force and across Home Affairs. The nation-building role of the old department of immigration has also been lost amidst a fanatical political focus on external and internal threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All governments are entitled to their administrative arrangements, and the parliament has properly facilitated those decisions in relation to Home Affairs through legislative actions. Prime Minister Morrison is unlikely to make any major changes to the Home Affairs portfolio before the election. However, whoever does win the election should take the opportunity to reconsider the arguments around the creation of Home Affairs, and, I suggest, move to dismantle the portfolio in favour of a more balanced approach to national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year on from the creation of the new portfolio, I think it is now increasingly clear that the co-location of ASIO, the AFP and the Criminal Intelligence Commission with other elements of Home Affairs constitutes an excessive concentration of power. Notwithstanding the safeguards that apply to individual agencies, too much power has been placed in the hands of a single minister. This would be the case even with a minister other than the current incumbent. ASIO, the AFP, the Criminal Intelligence Commission and AUSTRAC should be transferred back to the Auditor-General's portfolio, together with responsibility for all aspects of telecommunications interception and access. That would leave Home Affairs as a border protection and immigration agency—a shift that would best be reflected with an appropriate name change. It would also be appropriate for the Home Affairs secretary to be moved somewhere else where his energy, if not his empire-building zeal, might be usefully employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a crossbench senator, I make these observations, aware that it will be a matter for whoever forms the next government to make their administrative arrangements. However, I would urge both government and opposition—perhaps especially the opposition—to rein in the Home Affairs juggernaut. It would be most unfortunate if this conglomeration of power were to become a permanent fixture in the Australian body politic, ready to be picked up and exploited in the future by some ambitious and unscrupulous political figure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of the next election, it will not be too late or too difficult to make the changes needed to restore a sound balance in the handling of national security matters—a balance that would be more in keeping with the traditions of our liberal democracy and bear much less resemblance to the structure of a police state—and I would urge the next government to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:42</span>):  Tonight I want to speak about Lake Malbena, in the Walls of Jerusalem National Park, in my home state of Tasmania. It is a most spectacular part of Tasmania and, therefore, one of the most spectacular parts of this world. I have been to the Walls of Jerusalem National Park many times, and I have loved the times I have spent there. They've nurtured my spirit. The Walls of Jerusalem National Park lies at the very heart of the beautiful heart-shaped green island at the bottom of this country—Tasmania. The Walls of Jerusalem National Park is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. That means that it has been protected for a range of natural and cultural heritage values. It means that it is being looked after on behalf of all of humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also means that it is the Australian government's duty to hold this place in trust so that its precious values, natural values and cultural heritage values, can be preserved not just for people who are alive today but also for future generations. But the Liberal Party in Canberra and the Liberal Party in Hobart have comprehensively failed to do this. They are selling out Lake Malbena, inside the Walls of Jerusalem National Park, inside the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, in a secret deal with one of their private sector mates. That private sector mate of the Liberal Party has put forward a proposal for luxury accommodation at Lake Malbena and for numerous helicopter flights ferrying wealthy tourists into and out of the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposal is nothing less than a privatisation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. It is a triumph of greed over respect. Development within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area has been subject to two clandestine state assessments. The proposal was given the green light under the Tasmanian government's dodgy, secretive, expressions-of-interest process in 2016. The state government also re-zoned Lake Malbena as a self-reliant recreation zone in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Management Plan, which has far fewer protections than a wilderness zone. This re-zoning was done specifically to accommodate the development application, and it was done after public consultation on the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Management Plan had concluded. Just to step that out for senators: a draft management plan was put out that actually had Lake Malbena and Halls Island inside the wilderness zone of the World Heritage Area, which means that no commercial development is allowed at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what went out to the public. The public got a chance to comment. Many, many thousands of submissions were made in regard to other terrible aspects of that management plan. Those submissions came in, the government considered them, and then they put out the final plan. When we had a look at the final plan, to our horror they'd moved the boundary of the wilderness zone so that Lake Malbena—which had previously been in the wilderness zone, and therefore commercial development was prohibited—was suddenly outside the wilderness zone, which means that commercial development is not prohibited. To call this dodgy is an understatement. It was completely and utterly dodgy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service then undertook a reserve activity assessment of the proposal and issued a draft final determination to approve the project, subject to conditions, on 14 March this year, pending the outcome of a referral for assessment under federal law. The proposal was then referred to the then federal environment and energy minister for a decision as to whether it required his approval under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999—the EPBC Act. On 31 August this year the federal government announced its decision that the Lake Malbena project was not a controlled action and therefore did not require a detailed assessment or approval under the EPBC Act. This was a decision that started on Mr Frydenberg's watch and ended on the watch of Ms Price. The federal environment department's Assessments and Governance deputy secretary, who signed off on the proposal on behalf of Ms Price, advised that potential noise impacts from the helicopter flights in and out had been successfully 'avoided or mitigated'. Yet later he admitted that he was unsure how many flights there would be into the development in total, and he was not sure of the servicing and maintenance requirements.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision brief itself referred only to a maximum of 30 trips per year, but, hidden deep in the 100-plus pages of attachments to that brief, that was expanded on:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… the heli-use required to facilitate up to 30 guiding packages per year is in the vicinity of 60-120 return heli-trips.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision was made despite submissions from three government-appointed expert panels recommending against this development approval. This included the government's own expert panel on the management of the World Heritage Area and the National Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council, which advised:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The proponent does not address the fundamental concern that the proposal is for a development with several buildings, not a 'standing camp' …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll end that quote there to point out that the proponent is claiming that this is for a standing camp. That is a lie. It is for permanent structures. It's very important that people understand this. I'll go back to the NPWAC advice. The second thing that they advised was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… without adequate consideration, precedents will be set that will degrade the World Heritage Values of the TWWHA.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing that NPWAC said was:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">NPWAC does not support this project progressing at this time and reiterates that contentious projects such as this should not be considered until there is an agreed framework to guide assessment.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That framework was asked for by the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations years ago and has still not been delivered—this is a tourism master plan—by state or Commonwealth governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that NPWAC advice condemning the application, 129 detailed public submissions were made to the federal government, the vast majority of which stridently opposed this terrible intrusion into Tasmania's wilderness. These submissions opposing the Lake Malbena development came from environment groups, bushwalking groups, Aboriginal groups, fishers groups, anglers groups and the general public. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is on the nose in Tasmania. It has been facilitated by a corrupt, secretive process that the Tasmanian people have been locked out of deliberately by the state Liberals with the complicity of the Liberals here in Canberra. We are governed by people who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing, and they are selling off Tasmania's precious wilderness piece by piece. Wilderness is such a precious thing in today's world, and it deserves to exist for its own sake, not as a foundation for greedy, rent-seeking profiteers. The Tasmanian government is not just selling off our wilderness; they are allowing the development of massive fish farms in publicly-owned waterways right around the Tasmanian coastline. They want to put a cable car up the summit of beautiful kunanyi/Mount Wellington, which will be a scar on that iconic landmark that is so precious to so many people in Hobart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a message for the major parties who support all of these things: these places, our coastlines, our wilderness, our forests and our mountains, are not yours to sell. And I've got a message for those who profit from these places at the expense of the values they were protected for: these are not your places to despoil. Tasmanians will fight back against this, and the Greens will be with them all the way.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="217241" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:52</span>):  I rise this evening to speak about the legacy of a remarkable woman, Lady Phyllis Cilento. Lady Cilento belonged to one of Australia's most prominent families. She had a long history of public service. She was a household name in Brisbane—indeed, across Queensland—for almost half a century, where she worked as an obstetrician, a paediatrician, an author, a journalist, a columnist, an ABC broadcaster and a women's activist. She travelled widely throughout her life in her youth, heading to Britain and Europe in 1919 shortly after the end of the First World War and the Armistice. While in Europe, she travelled through France, Belgium, Holland and Italy. In France, Lady Cilento trekked through the still untouched battlefields of the Great War, an experience that must have been incredibly, profoundly sobering and heart-wrenchingly sombre for her, but one that must have played an indelible role in shaping Lady Cilento's future endeavours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout her life, Lady Cilento saved the lives of countless women and children in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia. She pioneered work in public health, nutrition, family planning and child care. She was named the first Queenslander of the Year; was given a lifetime membership of the Australian Medical Association; founded the Mothercraft Association of Queensland and the Queensland branch of the Business and Professional Women's Club; and was President of the Queensland Medical Women's Society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lady Phyllis Cilento was an absolutely remarkable woman, and she did all of this—she achieved as much as she did—while also raising six children. I, and many Queenslanders, thought it was pretty fitting when, in 2013, the Queensland state government, the then Liberal-National government, chose to recognise Lady Phyllis Cilento's remarkable legacy of pioneering children's health care by naming Brisbane's new children's hospital after her—an enduring honour to remember the life and works of a pioneer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was with great surprise to Queenslanders and, in particular, Lady Cilento's family when they heard that the Queensland Labor government was in the process of taking the extraordinary step of removing Lady Cilento's name from the hospital. Why? The Labor health minister claimed this was because Queenslanders didn't know it was a public hospital and that research grants were hindered because of this, and yet a noble laureate was recently reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> saying that the 'Lady Cilento' name would not stop grants at a national or international level; it would, rather, encourage them. Apparently, a petition was circulated amongst the staff at the hospital which was said to have gathered over a thousand signatures, yet many doctors and nurses at the hospital claim never to have seen the petition and the petition has never been shown to the public. It's a bit of a farce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. In August this year, the health minister, Steven Miles, launched an online poll—or, as he called it, public consultation—about changing the name. When it closed, the poll had 38,681 votes. Now, 23,982 of those votes had voted yes to changing the hospital's name. You'd think that was pretty conclusive and perhaps Queenslanders did want to see the hospital name changed, yet this was another Labor stitch-up. The public consultation was a farce. It was a gerrymander from the beginning. Almost 18,000 of those yes votes came from the same 74 IP addresses. Some of those IP addresses voted yes more than 100 times each. Four IP addresses voted yes more than 1,000 times each. And, for those who are beginning to sense a bit of a trend here from Queensland Labor, many of those IP addresses are starkly familiar, even the same as the IP addresses used by Queensland Labor ministerial offices. So the Queensland Labor government's public consultation into renaming the hospital was rigged from the start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a separate poll conducted by the Nurses' Professional Association of Queensland, 85 per cent of their members wanted Lady Cilento's name kept by the hospital. In another poll, by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier-Mail</span>, 84 per cent of Queenslanders voted against changing the name, and a further Galaxy poll commissioned by Channel 9 only this week revealed that 65 per cent of Queenslanders wanted to keep Lady Cilento's name. This is a world apart from the rigged Queensland Labor poll, which said that, allegedly, 67 per cent of Queenslanders wanted to get rid of the Lady Cilento name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why were Labor doing this? Consider this: the Queensland Labor government first floated the idea of changing the name of the hospital in July this year, yet, upon searching the Australian Securities and Investments Commission database, it turns out that the Lady Cilento name was deregistered by the Queensland Labor government in—wait for it—January this year. So Queensland Labor thought they were being devious. They thought they could be sneaky and deregister the name at the start of the year without anyone noticing and then they realised they needed to justify it, so Queensland held a rigged online poll. They fabricated, they gerrymandered, they lied and they stitched up anything to get the result they wanted. It's typical Labor: vote early, vote often. It's another Queensland Labor dodgy deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that Labor, being caught out, might not go ahead with this, but they're still going to push ahead. They've been caught out lying and they're going to spend half a million dollars—on their estimates—on changing the name. That's another farce. Anyone with a pencil, a piece of paper and a bit of an idea of how to do things in the business world would know it's going to cost a lot more than that. The cost involved with erecting the hospital's name included $200,000 per day to rent a crane for three days, plus the cost of the road closure and police supervision. This means that, to remove the old sign and replace it with the new one, it would cost $600,000 for the crane hire alone. That does not take into account the cost of producing the main sign and all the associated signs around the building: the traffic signs; the linen, uniform and stationary; the computer systems, the helipad. Even the board room table will need to be rebranded. Estimates from marketing and branding experts put the actual cost of the entire name-change exercise at between $15 million and $20 million. Words fail me. What a complete waste of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider this: Labor wasted this money on changing a name when 32 per cent of emergency department patients aren't seen on time. Twelve per cent of ambulance patients are ramped for 30 minutes. This means ambulances and paramedics cannot be on the road actually doing their jobs. Seventeen per cent of elective surgeries aren't done on time. The median wait time for elective surgery is 68 days. That's almost double the statewide average. They've spent $15 million on changing the signage rather than fixing up the hospital waiting times. This is a typical example of Labor's warped priorities. The Lady Cilento Children's Hospital is one of only three per cent of buildings named after women in Australia. Lady Cilento was an outstanding role model in an era when there were very few high-profession women. It's symbolic of this arrogant Queensland Labor government that an Australian professional woman's name is torn down from a public building just to serve their twisted political agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funnily enough, if you take the fraudulent votes—the people who voted more than once; those double voters, those Labor voters—out of Minister Miles's own poll, even their own poll shows that 67 per cent were in favour of keeping the name. Minister Miles has been referred to the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission, as he should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think a lot of people will be appalled by the actions of this Labor government—appalled at the renaming of a hospital which was named after an incredible woman whose legacy deserves to be honoured. I'm appalled, and we should all be appalled, that, instead of spending money to make the hospital run more efficiently, they want to throw money into changing the name—money that could be spent looking after our children, money that should be spent looking after our children. We should condemn Queensland Labor. We should condemn the arrogant decision to rig, to gerrymander, to lie, to stitch up and to defraud the public voting on this. We should call upon Queensland Labor and call upon the state government to keep that name, the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, there to honour someone who did so much for public health in Queensland.</span>
