I'll allow it on this occasion, but I'm making the warning more generally. If it goes for more than a page and it takes a minute and a half for you to read and you get almost halfway through the alphabet, it's a sure sign it's too long, but I'll let him proceed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WILKIE:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Speaker. There is an urgent need to suspend standing orders to deal with this motion because the misconduct at Crown has reached such staggering proportions that it can be no longer ignored by this place. We now have such a long list of allegationsâit probably does go through the alphabet, Speakerâserious allegations of organised crime; illegal offshore activities, in particular in China, resulting in the arrest of numerous Crown employees; insider trading, with the revelations that the company has given James Packer access to privileged information which he's not entitled to; money laundering; illegal modification of gambling devices; domestic violence; and drug dealing and trafficking. There is an urgent need to suspend standing orders and to deal with this because we cannot rely on the existing inquiries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currentlyâin fact, just todayâthe New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority is continuing with its inquiry into whether Crown is fit and proper to hold the licence for Barangaroo. What remarkable work that inquiry is doing and what remarkable revelations have emerged, including, as recently as this morning, the chairwoman's admitting that money laundering is going on at Crown casino and being unable to explain the evidence presented by me last year of young people walking into gambling rooms at Crown casino with Aldi bags containing millions of dollars in cash which was being swapped for chips and then almost straightaway being cashed in so the money was effectively washedâmoney laundered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the New South Wales inquiry is its terms of reference are simply too narrow to go to all of the matters we need to consider, including the conduct of governments and politicians and political parties. The Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, the VCGLR, is currently doing an inquiry, but that agency has shown itself to be worse than useless in recent years. In fact, its so-called inquiry at the moment is simple a show-cause asking Crown if it has been up to no good and accepting that Crown said, 'There's nothing to see here.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday it was revealed that the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, is finally on the job and is investigating allegations of money laundering at Crown, but, again, the remit of that organisation is just too narrow. It will only be looking at the money-laundering allegations. I regret to say that, as pleased as I am that AUSTRAC is now on the job, I don't have huge confidence in that organisation. Remember that the first allegations of money laundering were made over three years ago, but it was only yesterday that we learnt that AUSTRAC is actually conducting an investigation into Crown. I would add, when talking about AUSTRAC, let's not forget that last year I provided hard evidence in this place that between 90 and 95 per cent of club poker machine venues in New South Wales are not compliant with money-laundering and terrorism-financing allegations. When I reported that to AUSTRAC last year my concerns were batted away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General said last year, when I called for a royal commission into the casino industry, that all was well and that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity was on the beat and would look into it. Of course, ACLEI didn't find anything, and it didn't result in any action taken against Crown casino, despite all of the evidence then and all of the evidence since. So I regret to say that the ACLEI inquiry launched by the Attorney-General last year and which was supposed to hose down this whole issue with Crown was at best incompetent and at worst a whitewash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed is a royal commission, so there's an urgent need to suspend standing orders for everyone in this place to debate the merits or otherwise of having a royal commission to look specifically at Crown casino. There are no existing inquiries that will do the job, and neither can we have faith in the existing regulatory framework to clean up Crown or the casino industry more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, one of the problems here and one of the challenges I have in convincing honourable members to support my motion is that the political class have been running a protection racket for Crown Resorts for years. How else to explain the fact that, about one year ago, when I called for a royal commission into the casino industry, with all of the evidence that was available at that time, neither the government nor the opposition supported that motion? But I suppose that's understandable when you consider the money that sloshes around in this matter. In fact, when I pull up the financials for financial year 2018-19, which, of course, is the 11Â½ months leading up to the 2019 federal election, I see that Crown Resorts donated $179,642 across 20 donations, all focused on the three states where it has casino licences. What a fabulous investment that was for Jamie Packer and his mates at Crown! For less than $200,000, they paid another one of their insurance policy instalments to ensure that the political class would continue to protect them. If my honourable colleagues in this place want to refute that allegation, if my honourable colleagues in this place want to showâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I say to the member for Clark I'm picking him out not on an aspect he's necessarily suspecting. He needs to be demonstrating why standing orders should be suspended, so he needs to relate his material to that. If they happen to be suspended, he's obviously free to have the debate, but the debate is about whether standing orders should be suspended or not.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Speaker. Yes, standing orders must be suspended and we must deal with this motion immediately because so much evidence, including as recently as this morning in the New South Wales inquiry into Crown, has now accumulated that it is clear that Crown Resorts is a festering sore that needs to be dealt with in this place at a political level. We cannot anymore rely on other inquiries or other agencies. Not only do we have to deal with it politically in this place; we need to do it urgently. We can't let this rot go on any longer. Every day we allow Crown Resorts to keep trading the way it's been trading for umpteen years is another day that it is breaking the law. It's another day that directors are not doing their duty. It's another day the community is not being protected from that lawbreaking. So it is patently clear, I suggest, that we need to suspend standing orders to deal with this.</span>

Unless honourable members back this motion, they will show again that they are part of the problem and not prepared to be part of the solution.</span>

There is an inquiry going on at the moment with respect to Crown in New South Wales, and that is why there is such urgency today. Time is of the essence. The terms of that inquiry are too narrow and nobody is being held to account. What we need is a royal commission. That is why it is so urgent that we suspend standing orders today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to believe that it was a year ago that I stood in this place and supported the member for Clark in his initial call for a royal commission. That was following video footage of alleged money laundering, with a bag of money, thousands of dollars in an Aldi shopping bag, going over the counter at Crown and then being returned as gambling chips and then going back as gambling chips with the money washed. We heard shocking allegations of junket operations and concerns around border security, prostitution and further money laundering. Those allegations have been made on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day that we don't act is a day where further harm can be caused. That is unacceptable and that is why there is this urgency today. We have done very, very little in this place to address the harm caused by gambling, the harm caused by Crown casino. That is why I supported the member for Clark's motion last time, that is why I support his motion this time and that is why I support that the standing orders be suspended so that we can deal with this motionâbecause it is so incredibly urgent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time there was a motion around Crown casino, both the major parties voted together. Why did they do that? It's hard to know because it isn't that often that everybody joins together in this placeâthe major parties, anyway. But then, today, I had a look again. I refreshed my mind as to the Australian Electoral Commission's list of donationsâ$1.47 million in the last 10 years has been gifted by the very generous Crown Resorts Ltd to the major parties. More than $1.8 million is on the record with the AEC.</span>

Time is of the absolute essence. Looking at the obscene amount of donations, I am surprised we don't have a 'parliamentary friends of Crown Resorts' group in this place. The gambling industry is our NRA. We must address this as a matter of urgency.</span>

The government will not be supporting the suspension of standing orders and the government doesn't support this motion. The suspension of standing orders is calling for a motion to be moved which self-evidently calls to refer a matter to a royal commission, so to create a royal commission. The government believes this is a completely inappropriate course of action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues are not new to this chamber. Members would recall that in July 2019, when these serious allegations were first raised, the government referred them to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commission Act 2006. I can also advise the House that on 30 July 2020 ACLEI concluded its investigation, and its investigation report is publicly available on its website. The investigation considered three allegations: whether there was corruption by Home Affairs staff in relation to the provision of Australian visas for Crown VIPs; whether there was corruption by Australian Border Force staff in relation to the clearing of those VIPs at the Australian border; and whether an ABF staff member engaged in corrupt conduct while employed by a VIP junket operator. A significant investigation was undertaken by ACLEI in relation to each of these three corruption allegations. This investigation was looking for any evidence that staff members from Home Affairs or Australian Border Force engaged in corrupt conduct in the provision of visas for Crown VIPs or the clearing of those VIPs at the Australian border. The investigation also looked for evidence of corruption in relation to a particular ABS staff member who was also employed by a VIP junket operator. In investigating whether there was corruption by Home Affairs staff in relation to the provision of Australian visas for Crown VIPs, ACLEI's investigation included reviewing the arrangements Home Affairs had with Crown to support applicants for visas and for reviewing visa applications processed under that arrangement. The investigation did not find evidence of corrupt conduct by Home Affairs or ABF staff in relation to any of the three allegations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was stated in the House the last time the member for Clark sought to establish a joint parliamentary committee inquiry into allegations surrounding Crown casino, ACLEI was the most appropriate body to consider these allegations. It is worth reminding the member and the House that ACLEI is the specialist agency responsible for the investigation of corruption issues in Australian government law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Home Affairs. ACLEI is highly experienced in these types of investigations. In fact, it is better resourced to quickly and effectively commence an investigation into allegations of corruption than any other single body or envisaged body in the Commonwealth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might note for the member for Clark's benefit that ACLEI's investigative powers are essentially the same as a royal commission's, including the power to compel evidence. I might also note that it has covert powers, such as controlled operations powers, as well as the power of arrest. So, if ACLEI obtains admissible evidence of any criminal offence in the course of its investigation into this matter, it must, by compulsion, give the evidence to the relevant police or prosecutorial authority, including state or territory authorities. As noted, the ACLEI investigation has been completed, with the conclusion that there was no corrupt conduct. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth noting that the New South Wales state government has launched its own investigation, chaired by the Hon. Patricia Bergin. The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority established an inquiry under section 143 of the Casino Control Act 1992 in New South Wales on 14 August 2019 regarding Crown Resorts' Barangaroo casino licence. Under its terms of reference, the inquiry has focused on the events in late May 2019 surrounding Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Ltd's share sale agreement with CPH Crown Holdings Pty Ltd to buy shares in Crown. Media reporting raising various allegations into the conduct of Crown Resorts, including money laundering and junket operators and whether it should continue to hold a restricted gaming licence, and ILGA's regulatory capability and domestic and international best practice on gaming operations and regulation. Hearings commenced on 24 February 2020 and will continue in the lead-up to the commissioner's report to the ILGA on 1 February 2021. I would also add that the Australian government's financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, has confirmed that it has commenced an enforcement investigation into Crown Melbourne and the enforcement investigation is as a result of an AUSTRAC compliance assessment that commenced in September 2019. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing orders should not be suspended to allow the member for Clark to move this motion. The government doesn't support the creation of a royal commission to conduct a simultaneous investigation into Crown casino when many of these issues have been addressed by ACLEI's investigation, while others are still subject to the ongoing New South Wales and AUSTRAC investigations.</span>

The member for Clark hasn't given the opposition any advanced warning or consulted us on this motion. If he's serious about it, I'd encourage him to discuss it with us, particularly the shadow Attorney-General. Crown casino is the subject of a number of investigations at the moment, including in New South Wales. We look forward to the conclusion of those inquiries. If there is a need for further inquiries, the opposition has an open mind on this matter. The point needs to be very clearly made: anybody who thinks that corruption doesn't exist isn't looking. You can see evidence of that in New South Wales at ICAC now. Anyone who thinks that corruption doesn't exist at a federal level is just naive. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister at the table just mentioned ACLEI, a very good organisation, an organisation that I had the privilege to oversee as the Minister for Home Affairs in the previous Labor government. It was in working with that organisation that I saw corruption close up. I saw corruption at Sydney airport, with customs officials trying to bring drugs into the country. It was the work of that organisation that the minister just mentioned that helped to expose that and catch those individuals and prosecute them. Over that period of time, we expanded the remit of ACLEI. But it is fair to say that that, in itself, is not enough. We need an organisation that covers every department, every agency and all the politicians here in this building if we're going to make sure that, where corruption raises its head, it's caught and it's stamped out. The fact that we're debating here again a call for another ad hoc royal commission into allegations which, amongst other thingsâ</span>

                  </a>  The opposition will always support motions that facilitate debate. This government all too often seeks to gag debate in this place. It doesn't like to hear alternative voices. It doesn't like to allow anybody from this side of the chamber to have their voice heard. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition stands at this dispatch box to suspend standing orders, he's almost automatically shut down. That is not good for public debate in this country. They don't let the parliament sit. It sat all too little this year. They don't like debate. Whenever the opposition leader, or any other member of the opposition, seeks to suspend standing orders, they get shut down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't like scrutiny. What did the government do in response to the organisation that identified the sports rorts scandal and that identified a block of land bought in Western Sydney that was valued at $3 million but was purchased for $30 million? They cut the budget of the Australian National Audit Office. That's what happened two weeks ago. It was a $14 million cut to that organisation. The minister asked me to argue why the suspension of standing orders should occur. I'll tell you why. It's because we need a bit of scrutiny in this place. There's an organisation which, because of the budget cut two weeks ago, instead of doing 48 investigations into the way in which the government spends public money, will only be able to do about 38 next year. It doesn't like scrutiny.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This place is where scrutiny should occur, so that's why we support the suspension of standing orders and that's why we support the establishment of a National Integrity Commission. It's essential, and I thought both sides of the House agreed. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that the government supported it. The current Prime Minister said that they support it. Now we're hearing that people on the back bench don't support it. If you're serious about weeding out corruption and if you're serious about good governance, then you allow debate, you encourage scrutiny, you fund organisations like the National Audit Office, you expand the remit of organisations like ACLEI and you set up a National Integrity Commission. Otherwise all you're going to get is more of what we've seen in New South Wales at ICAC last week, infesting federal politicsânobody wants that.</span>

This is something that needs scrutiny at the highest level. That's why it's so important that this parliament addresses this issue right now. Not only is the reputation of so many people in Melbourne at stake right now but also the reputation of the nation, as a fair and just nation, is at stake. It's why this parliament must get engaged in this debate and why this parliament must support the suspension of standing orders to debate a royal commission.</span>

It's why I'm introducing, on Monday, two bills to address this glaring gap in our parliamentâthat is, for a federal integrity commission that is robust, has teeth and can get to the bottom of allegations, such as what have been put to Crown casino.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to direct my remarks today to a group of Australians that our opponents used to talk about almost incessantly. Robert Menzies called them 'the forgotten people'. It was his phrase for Australia's middle class, the people who work hard to raise a family, put a roof over their heads and help build their communities. If the government's budget tells us anything, it's that today, in 2020, the Liberals have forgotten about 'the forgotten people'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the political amnesia was in effect well before the worst bushfires in recorded history, and an unexpected crisis brought about by a once-in-a-century pandemic. In the Liberals' seven years in power, the Australian economy never achieved trend growth. Wages stagnated across the board, from bakers to bank tellers, yet the cost of everything that's important to small business and hardworking Australian families went up. Power prices soared. The cost of child care soared, especially for the parents who wanted to go back to work full time. Apprenticeships and traineeships dried upâditto full-time work, as casualisation climbed and climbed again. Getting a university degree increasingly left young professionals saddled with spiralling debts. Business investment and new business registrations were both at historic lows. Even the Reserve Bank was pleading with the government to do more to kickstart the economyâbut all for nought. On top of all of this, this government has managed to devastate the relationship with our most important trading partner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are none so blind as those who refuse to see, and so it is with our coalition opponents. Blinded by their obsessive self-image, they somehow saw themselves as the champions of aspiration, despite the data and the chorus of calls to change course. That economic neglect and political narcissism was always going to be exposed in a moment of crisis, and, unfortunately for millions of Australians, that is precisely what has come to pass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As families and business owners battled during unprecedented bushfires to save the homes and livelihoods they'd worked so hard to build, the Prime Minister was on a beach in Hawaii. And while volunteers rallied with hoses and fire trucks to fight the flames, coalition MPs took pot shots at climate science and spread ridiculous conspiracy theories about arsonists. As it turned out, this was a desperately needed reality check. It shattered the Prime Minister's false vanity, and just as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When coronavirus hit, he was ill-equipped and needed Labor to show him the way forward. Labor saw wage subsidies as the seawall that Australians needed to protect them against the oncoming economic tsunami. We proposed it. He rejected it. And then he capitulated. But, as usual, when he did, the important details eluded him. After presiding over the greatest expansion of casualisation in the workforce this country has ever seen, the Prime Minister left casuals behind in his JobKeeper plan, and, after decades of Labor arguing that trickle-down economics was a hoax, it took a pandemic for the Prime Minister to realise the truths in our arguments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing unemployment benefits via the JobSeeker payment was a breakthrough moment for Australia. It was the moment they accepted the fact that not only is it morally the right thing to do but also it is economically responsible to build economic demand. For a precious moment, even the Treasurer argued that low-income people spent every dollar they got while high-income earners tended to save it. But, as with so much, their heart was simply not in it. So, even now, as unemployment is going up, support for the unemployed is going down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that wasn't the only home truth the pandemic taught this government. Let's talk about child care. At the height of the pandemic, the coalition government got a rare insight into the critical role that child care plays in the Australian economy. As social restrictions were imposed, it became obvious that so many of our essential service workers could not do their jobs if they didn't have access to child care. We also got an insight into the precarious financial state of many of our childcare providers. Short-term support was provided, but, in an act of complete disdain for the workers, they cut the childcare workers off JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This experience should've shown the Morrison government once and for all that child care is a key plank in a modern economy where both parents have to work. The so-called party of aspiration has really only ever believed in the aspirations of half the population. We all remember Tony Abbott saying: 'Women should do all the ironing.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem at the core of the coalition's approach to child care is that they see it as welfare. How else could they construct a budget that champions a $27 billion tax break for investment in businesses and see that as an economic measure, but see a $6 billion initiative to expand the availability of child care as welfare? Both measures are essential to moving the economy along, to growing aspiration and to growing participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government were scrambling for ways to help small and medium businesses to face the onslaught, again they looked back to Labor policies. Remember this: it was the former Treasurer Wayne Swan who introduced the instant asset write-off. They opposed it. They voted against it. And they dismantled it. It's our policy and we're proud of itâbecause we are a party of small business. Tradies, cafe owners, hairdressers and myriad other business owners know they can rely on policies to get the details of these issues rightâand so can all of those frontline workers against this invisible enemy. Labor immediately saw that nurses, aged-care workers and allied health staff were in great danger as COVID-19 spread. We saw the agonising choice that they faced, especially the army of casual workers in the healthcare sector, between quarantining at home without an income and going to work and risking infection. Pandemic leave could and should have been one of the first things the government did to protect not only healthcare workers but also the vulnerable clients they serve. To this government's eternal shame, it took months before it was rolled out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For us, there was something about the way the government handled this crisis that never completely rang true. We talk a lot about vision in this place, so much so that sometimes people forget what it really means. The government has never really had a vision to support what it did with the pandemic. The grim economic realities of this pandemic open their eyes ever so briefly, but all too soon they looked away again. An unfortunate reality is laid bare in this Treasurer's budget. I opened my remarks by reflecting on the statement of Robert Menzies and his 'forgotten Australians'. Let me now say that Australia's aspirational classes have never been forgotten by Labor. Those who strive to get their own home, get their kids into a career, build a business and get involved with their local community aren't some political theory or label. They are our neighbours, our classmates, our parents. But there is a forgotten class in Australia, there is a forgotten group of Australians: those in insecure work; those who sleep rough on our streets at night; those who don't have a home or a permanent residence; those who live lives of quiet desperation in social housing or in underfunded nursing homes; middle-aged workers who find themselves on the scrapheap, with a desire and ability to give more but without the opportunity. Why is it that the Liberals don't afford these people the gift of aspiration? Why is it that they are the new forgotten generation? Why are they never counted by those opposite as a source of this country's economic recovery rather than the brake that they so patently believe to be the case? When I talk about their lack of vision, that's the blind spot that this budget reveals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I return again to child care. Marginal tax rates can be as high as 70c and 90c in the dollar for working families where mum wants to work five days a week, or dad. Yet there is nothing in this budget to address that. When the economic lightning hit the proverbial dunny in March, the government saw how vital a role child care plays in sustaining the economy. But now it's only Labor's vision that sees aspiration by parents to work full time to get ahead even as they raise a family. It's only Labor that sees that tax cuts that get swallowed up by childcare fees are going to help nobody. It's only Labor that sees how middle-aged workers are some of our nation's most productive and valuable contributors and deserve a leg up as much as anybody else. It's only Labor that sees lowering power prices by rewiring the nation as the best way to get government back on its feet. These things should be no-brainers for a government of true vision. With these omissions, this government condemns the Liberals for leaving behind the very people they claim to represent. But, worse than that, it also leaves behind those that the Liberals have never really cared about, those that they dismiss as leaners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite haven't learnt the lesson of how important a properly functioning aged-care sector is, even with the recent evidence staring them in the face. They've forgotten the dignity written on the faces of rough sleepers after just a few nights in proper accommodation and how that experience uplifted us all, and they're simply blind to the dreams of those who live in social housing and want hope for themselves and their family. Those opposite will never understand why a single mother on disability support, living in a housing commission flat, has every right to expect that her son might go to university and enter a profession, start a business and create jobs or lead a political party with a real vision for the future. They will never understand that the price of these inadequacies is measured not just in the missed opportunities but in cold, hard cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look on in amazement that a government could rack up a debt which is galloping towards $1.7 trillion but leave nothing behind as a legacy for future generations, who are going to be paying off that debt. Where is the big vision? Where is the big infrastructure project? Where is the structural or the social reform? It's simply not there. It's the biggest budget deficit since World War II, in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP, with government debt galloping towards $1.7 trillion. Australians deserve better than this. They deserve much, much more, and they'll get it at the next election.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  It certainly felt like an historic moment, watching the Treasurer hand down the budget earlier this month. As I mentioned to a room full of northern Tasmanian business owners and employees the morning after the budget, when I was elected last year I certainly didn't imagine we would be facing the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. It's an unenviable position to be in, as a nation, but it's one that we, as a government, are able to respond to because of our economic strength prior to the pandemic reaching Australia's shores. As the Treasurer said on budget night:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We could do this because we entered this crisis from a position of economic strength, brought the Budget back to balance for the first time in 11 years and maintained our AAA credit rating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This gave us the fiscal firepower when we needed it most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decisions made by the Morrison government when the pandemic first hit were made quickly and decisively to protect the health of all Australians while trying to balance the devastating economic impact that this unprecedented crisis would bring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Bass we are proudly an innovative and entrepreneurial city, with around 83 per cent of Launceston's workforce employed in the private sector, compared to 76 per cent in Hobart. Our government's JobKeeper payment has supported 3,100 businesses in our region, supporting them through the pandemic and keeping them connected to their employees. Businesses such as the Tailrace Centre, Seahorse World and Flinders Island Aviation and many other businesses, from local fish and chip shops to a software development company, have all relied on this critical support to see them through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support for small and medium-sized businesses did not stop there. A few thousand businesses have received the cash flow boost to help them stay afloat, and, to support new investment and increase business cash flow, the government is providing a temporary tax incentive that will allow for thousands of businesses in my region to write off the full value of any eligible asset that they purchase. From tractors, trucks and cars to office equipment, this tax relief will unlock investment, expand the productive capacity of our nation and create tens of thousands of jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's push to revitalise our manufacturing industries across the country will see $52.8 million offered to local companies through the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund. This will be targeted in six priority areas: food and beverage manufacturing, medical products, clean energy, recycling and defence. George Town, my home town, is a proud manufacturing town with businesses like Environex, where I was pleased to take the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management in a pre-COVID era. I'm hopeful of seeing companies like Environex, who create new products from plastics such as IV bags from hospitals and silage wrap, benefit from initiatives such as this. The focus on recycling has been welcomed by the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing and Energy Council, who said the investment and focus in this key area will build on the state's manufacturing prowess and align with the culture of 'reducing our impact', further stating that the council welcomes the government's budget announcement 'as an opportunity to improve our social licence and look after the land we're on'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan will rebuild our economy and create jobs. Tasmania, like all states, has suffered economically since the pandemic began. However, as Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive Michael Bailey said after the budget was handed down, the job-creating infrastructure investment and tax cuts contained in the budget were what the state's struggling economy required. The federal budget was a win for small business in our community and the JobMaker hiring credit is already instilling confidence in the Northern Tasmanian business industry. Vision Hotels' Director Brendon Deeley told media that he was already discussing hiring new staff under the initiative. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will enable us to certainly bring on multiple staff, there's no question. So, if that's just us that are already, at a quick glimpse, talking about bringing more staff on because of this budget, I think there will be a whole bunch of employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another hospitality owner, Karen Burbury, said that the initiative would be beneficial. She stated that she found it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ exceptionally comforting to know that we can employ people from JobSeeker and have that subsidy in place. This is the budget we needed to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian apprenticeships will play a vital role in developing and delivering the pipeline of skilled workers that businesses and industry need to support our economic recovery. Our government's committed to supporting industries and apprentices across the country. The CEO of KEEN Partners in George Town, which focuses on growing people with meaningful and rewarding employment, including though apprenticeships, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Budget has delivered a massive opportunity for employers and apprentices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the scheme, we're providing for 100,000 new apprentices in the 2021 budget to support the next generation of our skilled workers and to help jobseekers get back into work, introducing a new 50 per cent wage subsidy for all businesses that take on apprentices over the period 5 October 2020 to 30 September 2021. The $1.2 billion Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy will support our next generation of skilled workers through 100,000 new apprenticeships. This measure is in addition to financial support already provided under the government's $2.8 billion Supporting Apprentices and Trainees package for existing apprentices and trainees, which is now expected to support 90,000 employers to keep 180,000 apprentices and trainees in employment and training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly, our $1.2 billion apprenticeship scheme has been given the thumbs up from business groups, with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO James Pearson saying the new subsidy should go a long way to turning around the concerning long-term decline in apprenticeship numbers. 'This is the right prescription to restore the health of the apprenticeship system,' he said. Master Builders Australia CEO Denita Warn said, 'Young people and building and construction business will be big winners.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 31 March this year, there were more than 9,000 young Tasmanians in apprenticeship and trainee programs, an increase of 16.1 per cent from just four years prior. Our government's continued investment in this area is working. This package announced in the budget is significant and provides an incredible opportunity to gain a job-ready skillset in a range of industries: hospitality, tourism, agriculture, aged care, arts, graphic design, hair and beauty and, of course, our tradies. These are all industries, I might add, that employ men and women, which is why I was left somewhat bemused by claims from the other side that this budget was not for women. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a significant number of measures in this budget which specifically support women, and here is a quick reminder for those who may need it. To start, our 2020 Women's Economic Security Statement includes a wide range of measures to provide targeted support for women to explore pathways to improve their employment opportunities, pay, participation and flexibility. The $240.4 million package over five years is a vital step in creating more opportunities and choices for women, not just for the recovery from COVID-19 but for the generations ahead. The economic support statement supports women into jobs now and helps drive economic growth into the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key budget initiatives include: expanding the Master Builders Australia's Women Building Australia program to support more women into the highly male dominated building and construction industry, expanding the innovative enterprising girls program to give girls and young women across Australia the skills and opportunities to start their own businesses in the digital economy. An additional $35.9 million will be invested in the existing Boosting Female Founders Initiative, to support up to 282 additional startups and 4,300 women entrepreneurs. As part of this ongoing support, we will link female founders up with expert mentoring and advice for women entrepreneurs. As a key measure in the 2018 economic statement, this initiative is already on track to support over 100 businesses to build their potential.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women currently make up a minority in STEM education, workplaces and senior leadership positions, at only 17 per cent of the STEM qualified population. The 2020 women's economic statement provides more opportunity for women to move into rewarding and lucrative STEM careers by investing an additional $14.5 million to expand several women in STEM programs, including the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship grants program, expansion of the Girls in STEM Toolkit, extending the Women in STEM Ambassador role and creating new STEM industry cadetships and advanced apprenticeships specifically for women. This $25.1 million program will specifically provide 500 women valuable career experience and a salary while they study an industry-relevant qualification in STEM.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government are providing a range of measures to support families by extending the paid parental leave work test to 20 months, offering important financial support to parents who do not meet the current work test provisions because their employment has been affected by COVID-19. Additionally, in recognition of the challenges that disadvantaged families are facing as a result of COVID-19, we're investing an additional $24.7 million in the ParentsNext program. Disadvantaged jobseeking parents who are struggling to re-enter the workforce and support their families will be able to access streamlined and extended services to get the support that they need to re-enter the workforce. This will provide assistance to approximately 235,000 parents, including those in my northern Tasmanian community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, I'm incredibly proud of securing $5.4 million through this budget to move the family law court in Launceston, which has become increasingly unsafe for families to access their services and for the employees who work in the building. I'd like to thank the Attorney-General for working so closely with me to listen to my concerns and working to achieve a fantastic outcome. Additionally, as someone who has continuously advocated for increased access to mental health services, I am particularly pleased to see the doubling of the number of Medicare funded psychological services from 10 to 20.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  [by video link] This is a budget that puts the millionaires ahead of the million unemployed. This budget is a trickle-down con job. Budgets are about choices and this budget has chosen to ignore the massive problems that Australia is facing at the moment and instead give $99 billion a year in handouts to big corporations and the superwealthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just today we were told that we are facing a climate crisis of incredible proportions here in Australia, with the Bureau of Meteorology telling Senate estimates that on current trajectory, including this government's targets, we could see 4.4 degrees of warming in Australia during the lifetime of today's primary school students. That means creating a hell on earth in this country. We're facing a climate crisis. We're also facing an inequality crisis in this country. Inequality is at a 70-year high. You can work full time in this country but still be living in poverty, and that's because we have a third crisis in this country, which is a jobs crisis. Before the coronavirus pandemic even started, nearly one in three young people in this country either didn't have a job or didn't have enough hours of work. Of course, those numbers have gone up since the coronavirus hit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of the climate crisis, the inequality crisis and the jobs crisis, this budget could have been a green recovery, a Green New Deal, a plan of investment and action in industries that will tackle the climate crisis and make Australia a more equal and caring societyâthings like investing in free education, aged care, renewable energy. All of those things could have been done by the government in this budget and they would have addressed not just the economic recession we find ourselves in but the inequality crisis and the climate crisis as well. What has the government done? The government has done exactly the opposite. The government has made a choice to prolong this recession, to keep unemployment higher than it needs to be, to increase inequality in this country and to fast-track the climate crisis. In short, with this budget the government has chosen to make the problems that Australia is facing even worse. Why has it chosen to do that? Because this budget is a trickle-down con job written by the big corporations for the big corporations, who also happen to be Liberal Party and Labor Party donors. That's why the government, instead of directly investing to create jobs and provide the services people in this country need so that we can have a more equal society, are writing out huge blank cheques in this budget to their big corporate mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of the budget measures that were proposed by the government and waved through last week with the support of the Labor Party. One of them is giving big corporations a $27 billion blank cheque from taxpayers to spend as they like. The government say: 'Trust us. We'll give money to big corporations and let them make lots of purchases, and we'll hope that some of that wealth trickles down and finds its way into job creation.' The problem is that there are no strings attached to the money given out in this new tax break for the big corporations, many of whom are already profitable and in fact have increased their wealth during the course of this financial crisis. They could buy cheap computers from China. They could go out and buy office furniture from overseas. It could be something that will not create one new job, but it will give them a tax write-off. The Greens in the Senate said, 'If you're going to give this $27 billion blank cheque to big corporations, at least make sure it's Australian-made.' No, Liberal and Labor voted against that. We said, 'At least make sure it doesn't go into making the climate crisis worse.' No, Liberal and Labor voted against that. So in this budget we've got $27 billion in handouts going to the big corporations courtesy of Liberal and Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got from the government a scam of a scheme that is going to help McDonald's and others like it line their pockets to help subsidise wage costs. The bill we saw pass the parliament yesterday when the government wanted to bring it on and Labor said, 'You're not bringing it on quickly enough; let's pass it through,' will allow big corporations like McDonald's to employ young people at the minimum wage for 20 hours a week and get 200 bucks a week for it. Even companies that have been so profitable during the crisis that they've been able to pay dividends, even corporations that have underpaid and ripped off their workersâcompanies that have been engaging in wage theftâare going to get some of this $4 billion thanks to the legislation that was rushed through yesterday by the Liberals and Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the other centrepiece of this government's budget, again supported wholeheartedly by Laborâthat is, giving tax cuts to millionaires. If you've managed to keep your job throughout this crisis and earn more than a million dollars a year, you don't need a tax cut. The priority should be the million people who are unemployed, not going into debt to give a tax cut to millionaires and the superwealthy, the likes of Clive Palmer. They don't need a tax cut, to be frank. We shouldn't be going into debt to give money to them. We should be looking after the million unemployed in this country not only by keeping JobSeeker where it is and making sure that they have got enough money to live on until the economy gets back on its feet again and jobs are available for everyone who wants one but alsoâinstead of giving tax cuts to millionaires, as Liberals and Labor wantâby using the money to invest directly in government services that will make Australia more equal and will create jobs directly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, what's going to happen? Someone earning $1 million a year gets 2Â½ thousand bucks; someone who is among the working poor might get $250; and, if you're unemployed, you get a kick in the teeth. And what the establishment parties won't tell you about the tax cuts they fast-track through is that, if you're a middle-income earner, you only get them for one year; after that, they disappear. It's a one-year-only deal if you're on a middle income. But the millionaires keep getting the tax cuts forever, which keep getting bigger and bigger because the Liberals, with Labor's backing, have put the millionaires ahead of the million unemployed, because they are in the pockets of their corporate donors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this recession is hitting young people the hardest. It's hitting women hard and it's hitting young people hard. The jobs that young people worked in were the hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis, but the support that the government offered discriminated against young people, with a million casuals, many of whom were young, locked out of government support; and jobs in universities excluded from government support. Not only were young people in the industries that were hit the hardest; the government then deliberately turned its back on them. But it's going to get even worse, because many of those jobs that young people either had or the industries they were hoping to get into might take the longest to get back on their feet after the coronavirus recession, especially here in Victoria, when many of those jobs are in arts and entertainment, hospitality, retail and tourism, which might take a very long time to get back on their feet because the social-distancing restrictions will still be in place. Add on top of that an insecure job market, expensive higher education, unaffordable housing and the climate crisis, and you understand that we risk creating a lost generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, in this budget, has turned its back on those young people. I have heard countless stories from people in my electorate who, in the midst of this crisis, have had their JobSeeker payment cut, while the government, with Labor's backing, gives out tax cuts to millionaires. I have heard stories from people like Julie from Abbotsford. She was a chef in the cafe industry, who lost work when we all stayed at home and followed the restrictions to tackle COVID-19. For Julie, the new rate of JobSeeker after the government's cuts will not cover her rent, let alone anything like food or bills. For Jessie in Carlton North, a cut to the JobSeeker payment means not being able to afford medication, food, or psychology appointments. Jay in Princes Hill told me, 'The reduction in the rate is likely to destroy my career, my housing security and financial future.' That this government is prioritising tax cuts for those still employed but abandoning the millions of employees who have paid taxes for decades is deeply distressing. That is dead right, Jay: a tax cut doesn't help you if you don't have a job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it was wrong for the government, with Labor's backing, to prioritise tax cuts for millionaires and people who have kept their job, putting them ahead of people who have been left behind and are doing it tough. If budgets are about making choices, which they are, then this government is choosing to give $99 billion a year in subsidies to big corporations and the very wealthy and, with Labor's backing, give tax cuts to millionaires, while dropping people on JobSeeker back into poverty. I say, very simply, if there's money in this budget for a tax cut for millionaires or there's money to keep people out of poverty, the latter is where the money should be going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you don't believe in the basic fairness of keeping people out of poverty, we know that tax cuts are a terrible stimulus if you give them to people who have a lot of money, because they're likely to save it, whereas, if you increase JobSeeker, lift the minimum wage and lift minimum incomes for people who don't have a job, they are going to go and spend that money and assist in the economic recovery. So, even if all you were concerned about was the economy, you would prioritise lifting up those at the bottom over giving more to those at the top and hoping it would trickle down. Instead, this trickle-down budget, which got pushed through last sitting week with Labor's support, is just going to make the inequality crisis worse in this countryâand it's going to prolong the recession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a critical point here. The government in this budget forecasts six per cent unemployment for years to come. In fact, the Treasurer has picked six per cent unemployment as his target and said, 'As soon as we get to six per cent in a couple of years time, we'll be able to start cutting.' Six per cent unemployment means two million people in this country without a job or without enough hours of work. That's not a target where you can say mission accomplished when you hit six per cent unemployment; that is a crisis. Two million people without enough work or without a job at all is a national crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say it's a choice because, with the government going into the debt that it is, the question is: what are we going to spend it on? The government could choose, as governments did after World War II, when we had to rebuild, to spend this incredible debt on job-creating, nation-building, planet-saving projects that would bring unemployment back down to two per cent, like it was in the time between World War II and the 1970s. If the government chose, instead of going into debt to fund tax cuts for millionaires with Labor's backing, to put that into building half a million new public housing units over the next 10 to 15 years, it would create 40,000 job and 4,000 apprenticeships in the process. Put that money into building new public housing and into getting Australia running on 100 per cent renewables and exporting our sunlight. Put that money into expanding our aged-care sector, because, if there's one thing we've learned from the coronavirus crisis, it's that privatisation has failed. It's failed the people in aged care it's and failed the workers there. Instead of giving tax cuts to millionaires, put the money into expanding free education and free child care across the country. Put it into health care because, as we know, women have lost jobs at higher rates than men during this crisis. All of those are industries where there are going to be women employed in potentially greater numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can have a recovery right now that doesn't involve giving billions to millionaires and hoping some of it trickles down but instead involves investing directly in public housing, in making schools and universities genuinely free, in making sure that everyone in this country not only has a roof but a secure, decent job if they want it, where we can offer a jobs guarantee that means everyone who wants a decent job could have it and where we could lift people out of poverty, which would not only make their lives better but help businesses and everyone trying to recover from the recession. We could do all of those things if we just stopped giving $99 billion a year in tax cuts and handouts to the superwealthy and big corporations. That is the choice that the government in this budget has failed to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the chance with this budget to invest in public housing, public schools, public education and public health care and expanding the jobs that are available so that we could go to every young person and say, 'We can guarantee you a decent job and an income that you can live on.' Instead, this government has actively chosen six per cent unemployment. It is criminal to be giving tax cuts to millionaires, which is what Labor and Liberal have just done, while there are a million people unemployed and while people are wondering whether or not they will have JobSeeker or JobKeeper or even just any kind of a job come the end of the year. This budget is not only an opportunity squandered; writing in these tax cuts, as Labor and Liberal have done, where 80 per cent will go to the top 20 per cent of income earners, will make life harder for future governments unless we've the guts to stand up to the big corporations and make them pay their fair share of tax so in this wealthy country of ours we can all live a good life.</span>

This year's federal budget is an economic recovery plan for the Sunshine Coast and every corner of Australia. This budget includes record funding for education, health and aged care. For a region like the Sunshine Coast, which saw unemployment double during COVID in fewer than 50 days, the budget is unashamedly about job creation. For those Sunshine Coast locals in a job, our federal government wants to keep them in a job. For those who don't have a job, we want to help them find a job. Making that a reality on the Sunshine Coast is going to depend on maintaining consumer and business confidence and their ability to spend and invest.</span>

The Treasurer understands that, which is why the federal budget's two headline measures are targeted right to those points. The government is allowing 11 million Australians to keep more of what they earn through new tax cuts brought forward into this year. This is going to support consumer spendingâ</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  [by video link] My electorate has been one of the hardest hit in Victoria, both in terms of case load and job loss. The people of Fraser watched in horror as too many people in aged-care facilities suffered more than they should have when plans were implemented too slowly or were underresourced. Today I draw attention to the inadequacies of the budget for the people of Fraser. Even before COVID, the female underemployment rate was over 11 per cent in this area. The female underutilisation rateâthose who were unemployed plus those who want more hoursâwas over 17 per cent. That's almost one in fiveâa shocking statistic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to being in harm's way, in so many frontline positions it was women who bore the brunt of the economic impact of this recession. A telling point of difference between the government and those on this side is the long-term, reform-driven plan to expand access to child care that was laid out by the Leader of the Opposition. This was in stark contrast to the silence of those opposite on the issue of female participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those left unemployed by this recession I say, 'You deserved better.' This government somehow managed to rack up a trillion dollars in debt but couldn't say a word or find a single dollar for those on JobSeeker. People have rightly asked me why the budget couldn't provide more clarity beyond a few weeks, particularly heading into Christmas. The budget spent a lot of money, but the government did so without an eye to the future and while continuing to leave far too many people behind.</span>

Functional neurological disorder, FND, is a significantly disabling and distressing condition that impacts many Australians. However, due to a lack of widespread medical awareness and the sheer complexity of this disorder, many patients do not receive adequate treatment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">FND Australia began their journey in April 2017. They saw need in their community and responded as such, registering the first Australian FND charity: FND Hope Australia Inc. Although their initial goal was to provide hope for individuals struggling with this severe and isolating condition, they soon realised that providing hope was inadequate. They needed to improve the awareness and practical knowledge surrounding this disorder.</span>

They are Australians who, through no fault of their own, have been shut out as our borders closed and are now in very precarious situations. It's people like Hannah, in Tokyo. She told me her flight has now been cancelled four times. It's people like Jared, a young man in London who tells me he has never felt more isolated, helpless and alone in his life. It's people like Irene, whose daughter is stuck in Manchester. Irene says that, like a lot of people who cannot come home, her daughter has lost faith in the Australian government and is questioning the ethical values it's portraying to the world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all reasonable people. They don't expect miracles from their government, but they don't expect to be stranded without any way to get home for months on end, facing ever-increasing costs for plane fares they may never get to use. And is it any wonder they are losing faith when they see reports today that Tony Abbott has been able to fly between Europe and Australia not once but twice during this pandemic. He joins a growing list of people who seem to have connections to this government who get special treatment. Meanwhile, residents of my community are desperately waiting for the Morrison government to put together a real plan to get them home. During a pandemic, facing up to responsibility matters. It's time to live up to that responsibility and get these Australians home.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  Sandringham station and the Sandy line need more commuter car parking, not less. At the last election, the Morrison government funded the $3.1 million Sandy station parking upgrade for an additional 100 spots, a plan put forward by Bayside City Council. It was part of our $24.5 million commitment to do so at numerous railway stations across Goldstein. At Bentleigh and Elsternwick, plans are well underway, with the support of the City of Glen Eira. Plans are being advanced by the state government for north Brighton and Hampton. At Brighton beach, the soil is too sandy to take additional weight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's disappointing is not only that the state government is blocking development at Sandy station; it's its next plans. At a meeting at 4 pm on Monday 16 December 2019 with the CEO of Bayside and the mayor, Councillor Clarke Martin, he advised me the state government opposed development at Sandy station so they had the option to remove existing commuter parking so that the land could be used for rolling stock. The state government isn't opposing new parking at Sandy station; they're supporting less, and, in practice, none.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before COVID-19, Sandy station was already packed. Commuters and nearby residents desperately need additional parking. This demand will return. Bayside should be continuing to support additional car parking at Sandy station, and the state government should not be planning to take away what little parking there already is.</span>

We've had the scandal of the Leppington Triangle. We've had ICAC revelations of a former Liberal MP selling access to ministers on behalf of wealthy landowners and property developers. But what about the smaller landowners? Do they get access to the corridors of Macquarie Street? Do they get to set sale prices?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with Liverpool councillor Nathan Hagarty, I met with a small group of landholders in the Aerotropolis in August. They accept the airport and the Aerotropolis are coming. What they don't accept is their treatment by government. Will their properties be acquired? If so, when? Well, we don't know yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that the New South Wales department of planning are preparing more glossy brochures, while their Wianamatta-South Creek delivery strategy will confirm land uses, access, ownership and management arrangements. However, this strategy is yet to be developed, with consultation not expected to begin till much later this year. In the meantime, small landowners in the Aerotropolis are left in limbo. This is causing unnecessary stress, anguish and mental illness. Landowners' demands are not unreasonable. They want certainty, transparency and confidence in the process and for their future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ballarat based artist Ron Davis raises funds by handcrafting poppies by melting and recasting the lead from spent bullets collected from battlefields and recycling them into beautiful remembrance pieces. Ron was given a handful of lead recovered from the battlefields of Passchendaele in Ypres, Belgium, by Kerry Stokes and Doug Baird at the Australian War Memorial, to make some very special remembrance and Battlefield Blue poppies to be auctioned to raise funds for Cam's Cause and the Commando Association. The funds raised through his works are donated to support those who have risked their lives and made sacrifices to secure the freedoms we take for granted. A poem complements the poppiesâtouching words to help us reflect on the human cost of battle, raising awareness of the daily effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression on veterans and their families.</span>

COVID-19 means 'the grannie' will not be played at the MCG. But for my electorate of Corangamite it will be a source of great pride and inspiration in a time of semi-lockdown and great self-sacrifice for many, many local businesses and families. In anticipation of this duel, Geelong and much of Corangamite will be painted blue and white. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge my constituent Patty Dangerfield, who will be playing in his first ever grand final. This achievement is beyond well deserved. And Gary Ablett Jr, who also lives in my electorate, will conclude one of the most impressive AFL careers ever on Saturday with his 357th and final game.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cats finished fourth in the home and away, notching up 12 wins through a short season and maintaining the league's best percentage. And all this is made even more impressive by the Cats long standing at the top of the AFL ladder. I would like to thank the Cats for the work they do in our communityâin particular, their work with Barwon Healthâreminding us all to check in with loved ones and offer a helping hand through difficult times. The Cats will get over the line on Saturday. Even if they don't, I'm grateful to the club for the work they do in my community. The Cats are a testament to our community and our community is a testament to the Cats. Go Cats!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Lots of families have been separated this year because of COVID-19 travel restrictions. It has been, and continues to be, very difficult for many of them, and we've had to find different ways of staying connected. Annie and Brian McNab, a couple in my electorate who couldn't see their grandsons Matthew and Samuel earlier this year, used the antics of two bears, a tiger and a flamingo to stay connected via 101 emails over 101 days. Blue, Ringup, Big Jim and Flamingo would feature in daily emails with an accompanying picture showing them on different adventuresâfrom building a cubbyhouse to being a pirate and even making a fondue. Annie and Brian's house, at Shenton Park, also became a beacon for locals passing by, who stopped to see what their teddies were up to that day. The emails Annie and Brian sent are now in a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">101 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">miles in 2020</span> and all the profits from the sale of the book will go to the Telethon Kids Institute to help with their groundbreaking research. Among the challenges and pain of 2020, Annie and Brian found a beautiful way to be with their grandkids. I'm sure that everybody who buys a copy of this book will appreciate that many of the emails end with an excellent 'dad joke'âlike this one: 'Do you know what you call a gorilla with bananas in his ears? Anything you like, because he can't hear you.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  One thing you'll find in regional Australia, and it's certainly true of my community, is a can-do attitude. I've seen it during drought, bushfire and COVID-19. Last week I saw it again through the Gilbert's Motor Museum in Strathalbyn. This new museum in our community is the brainchild of a group of volunteers from the Strathalbyn Tourism Organisation who when enjoying a Christmas drink or two a couple of years ago were sad about the closure of the Gilbert's garage on High Street. The garage had been there for 116 years. Many parts of the site were heritage listed, including an old bank building, and it has a secret underground tunnel to the pub and old stables across the road. The owners were going to shut the doors and, as it was located on High Street, a tourist destination for antiques and collectables, the community thought something more could happen. And so they created a motor museum. Seven thousand volunteer hours later, they have created something truly unique. The displays change constantly. When I was there I saw a Rolls-Royce that had featured in the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Gatsby</span> and a remarkable collection of grand prix memorabilia. The local volunteers call their transformed garage a memory museum, not a motor museumâand it truly is that. There is something for all ages. There are little cars for children to have a look at. It is open from Wednesday to Sunday and it is very affordable to attend. I highly recommend a visit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Having a consistent, reliable mobile telephone service is an ongoing issue for regional and rural communities in this country, particularly in electorates like Canning. I'm therefore pleased to report that, earlier this year, three new mobile base stations in our region were announced by the Morrison government under the black spot program. These towers will improve connectivity on the Brookton Highway in the Perth Hills; on the Pinjarra-Williams Road in Wuraming; and in Lane-Poole Reserve. This will help our emergency services during bushfires and road accidents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we still have difficulties with mobile reception in fast-growing suburban developments. This is true for communities like Whitby in Serpentine-Jarrahdale. Mobile network infrastructure has not kept up with population growth in Whitby. We have suburbs less than an hour from the Perth CBD that continue to experience poor mobile service, and it's not good enough, especially during summer, where we have the risk of bushfire. Quality mobile phone reception is essential to modern daily life. So I'm working with my counterparts in local and state government on a solution for my community. I'd like to acknowledge the work and advocacy of the member for Darling Range, Alyssa Hayden. She's working hard to understand the issues. Last month I met with representatives from Telstra to discuss the situation in Whitby. We are looking to construct a new tower north of Mundijong to service the area. In the coming weeks, I'll be engaging further to demonstrate the need in this community. I will continue to advocate for Serpentine-Jarrahdale and other communities like it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I rise today to speak about some concerning news yesterday about the North-South Corridor infrastructure project, which, in 2015, then Prime Minister Mr Abbott promised would be completed between 2023 and 2025. Yesterday in South Australia documents were leaked regarding a press conference by the shadow minister for infrastructure, Tom Koutsantonis. The documents that were leaked by members of the state Liberal government showed that the South Road upgrade, in my electorate, may not be completed until possibly 2035âa decade later than was promised by the then Prime Minister. This means that we could experience five federal elections and four Olympic Games before the South Road upgrade is completed. This also means greater uncertainty for businesses, residents, church groups, schools and others in the community. People are left in limbo at a time when business confidence is at an all-time low. We know this project will create approximately 3,000 jobs, and it's desperately needed infrastructure for South Australia and Adelaide. These delays will continue to hold a cloud over the future of Thebarton. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Premier Marshall and the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, need to be upfront with the people of South Australia instead of dodging the questions I've written to them both on a number of occasions. They need to come clean and confirm when the South Road upgrade will be completed and how, because we need these jobs now and clarity now, not in 15 years. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It was about 566 megalitres and it failed within a few years. The Egyptians didn't have another crack at one until about 5,000 years later. It reminds me very much of the Queensland Labor Party, because 'Sadd al-Kafara' translates as 'dam of the pagans', but they built Paradise Dam and it failed as wellâor it looks like failing or they say it's failingâand I don't think they've ever built one since. </span>

Thank goodness that we now have the vision to start on this project. But the Labor Party want to have a crack at it as well, so they've started a panel. The chair of the panel is Ross Garnautâremember him?âof 'Our green super future' and Professor Allan Dale from James Cook University. That's the university that kicked out Peter Ridd. I don't think they're going to build a dam. They should get away from the charade and do what they really want to do, which is probably legalising marijuana, like Ms Ardern over in New Zealand. We want real vision. We have to go with industrious people, industrious people who build the infrastructure. It reminds me of vade ad formicam, which is, 'Go to the ant.' Translated properly, it is, 'Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider its ways and be wise.'</span>

This treatment protocol suggests outpatients over 50 years of age or those with a single comorbidity be immediately treated with a combination of drugs including zinc, hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic. This protocol is already being used by many doctors reporting great success, such as Dr Brian Tyson from California, who has treated 1,700 patients, with one hospitalisation and zero deaths. By comparison, if Dr Tyson had had the same case fatality rate as Victoria, he would have over 60 dead patients. Yet Australians are currently being denied access to this medical treatment protocol due to the unprecedented actions of state chief medical officers, who have interfered in the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship and banned doctors from prescribing hydroxychloroquine. It is a completely unsatisfactory situation that Australians are being denied access to a potentially life-saving medical treatment which is set out in peer reviewed and published studies in the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Journal of Medicine</span>. This ban must end, and I call on members of the opposition not to politicise this. People are dying. You should beâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Under the Liberal government, 2021 will be the most expensive year on record for millions of Australian families. We are a trillion dollars in debt, but the cost of living for working families is going up. The Morrison recession is putting real financial pressure on too many working Australians. Next year the rate of JobKeeper will drop and then in March it will be ripped away. JobSeeker is going down on 1 January 2021, back to $40 a day. Childcare fees went up 7.2 per cent last year, and this government has no plan to make it more affordable in 2021. Australian universities are going to have their highest fees on record in 2021, with some fees going up 113 per cent. And in the middle of all of that another 160,000 Australians will lose their jobs between now and Christmas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite have no plans, but do any of their Liberal counterparts in the states have a plan? We know the New South Wales Liberals want to increase the GST to 15 per cent, and in my home state of Western Australia we have Liza Harvey, the leader who wanted to hand billions of dollars to Clive Palmer, the leader who wanted to privatise Western Power. The only thing that Liza Harvey has achieved in her life is sending TAFE fees up 510 per cent, and she doesn't even want to give Western Australian families $600 for their power bills.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  On 21 October we mark National headspace Day, and it's my pleasure to speak about the great work this organisation is doing in the electorate of Ryan and around the country. Headspace provides essential and targeted mental health support for young people because, as we know, 75 per cent of mental health issues develop before the age of 25. With COVID-19 it has already been a tough year, particularly for young people and kids. We know that young people have felt the significant burden of job losses or family upheaval or lifestyle changes because of the pandemic. Young people can use the support measures and resources available through headspace to tackle the mental health challenges that this pandemic has caused. Those resources have provided invaluable assistance to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has made mental health and suicide prevention a national priority with an unprecedented $5.7 billion to be spent on mental health in 2021. In particular, the government is investing more than $630 million in the national headspace network to expand services, decrease waiting times and address the increased demand from the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank in particular the tremendous team at headspace Taringa in the electorate of Ryan for the work they do and the support they provide to the community. Over the past five years headspace Taringa has supported over 3,400 young people in the electorate with over 21,000 service visits, well above the national average for headspace centres. It is okay not to be okay. To find resources or someone to talk to about mental health please visit headspace.org.au.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  The Western Sydney Airport 'Leppington Triangle' land deal has had a whiff about it ever since it was revealed that a $3 million block of land owned by Liberal Party donors was bought by the Morrison government for $30 million. This week we know so much more. We know that public servants may have tried to cover up the land purchase when auditors questioned whether they'd paid too much. We know the valuer nominated by the landholder didn't actually get to go onto the land to do any of the valuations. He could only drive past. We know there were nine valuations and they chose the highest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new head of the department of infrastructure, Simon Atkinson, says he is trying to 'clean it up'. Two staff within the Western Sydney unit are under investigation. This unit's making huge decisions involving billions of taxpayer dollars. We also know that for the first time ever the Auditor-General alerted the Australian Federal Police to a deal, and that's the deal the Leader of the Nationals described as a 'bargain'. This was an Abbott's captain pick and now it's the Morrison government's mess. No-one's been able to look closely at these deals. We need to see what waste and mismanagement has already occurred. There is $27 million sitting there that I know could've been put to much better use in my electorate. Parliament has to lift the lid on this entire project and we need to let in the light.</span>

Firstly, we are committing $1.75 billion to build the North East link. This will get traffic off our local streets, helping Chisholm locals to get to work and back to their families safer and faster, and supporting thousands of jobs when we need them most as we come out of the pandemic. Secondly, we are investing millions in improving the safety of Chisholm's roads as part of the road upgrades that will result in an estimated 35 per cent reduction in fatal and serious injuries nationwide. We are also fixing the notorious Kingsway and Railway Parade North black spot in Glen Waverley and supporting local councils to deliver priority projects right across Chisholm. Infrastructure projects create more jobs, create our economy and connect people to their work, homes and loved ones. Thanks to our budget we will see all of these benefits continue to flow through to Chisholm locals and businesses for many years to come.</span>

On this day three years ago the end of shift siren sounded for the last time at the Holden plant in Elizabeth. It was a sound that signalled the death knell of the Australian car industry. What a grim anniversary, not just for every worker who lost their job, not just for a proud part of our history coming to an end, but for a vital part of our future that was thrown away by this government. Cutting down the Australian auto industry dealt us out of a new wave of technology that could have been made in Elizabeth and Altona in Geelong instead of overseas. What a devastating self-inflicted wound. Australians will never forget that it was the government that drove Holden and other carmakers out of Australia. 'Hockey dares GM to leave' was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin Review</span> front page, and leave they did. Australians will never forget the actions of this government. When the Prime Minister offered a $1.5 billion plan to revive manufacturing, it was a bit like someone accidentally demolishing the wrong house and then offering to buy a new doorbell as compensation. Going by this Prime Minister's record you'll never get the doorbell, just the announcement.</span>

Last week I visited Nathan, living in appalling conditions in his public housing unit which represented a health risk to his family for seven months. As a result of media attention, Nathan has now moved to a three-bedroom home with a backyard. This is a good thing, but why did the budget provide no funding for the maintenance of public housing to create immediate jobs and improve the lives of people like Nathan and his family?</span>

In the budget this year, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation increased its facility to $3 billion. This is a facility that has been established under this corporation. It was established while I was Treasurer. An important part of its job is to support the work that is done by community housing organisations and to partner with state governments so they can ensure that there are more projects for housing development for both affordable and social housing across this country. We're doing our part when it comes to that responsibility to ensure that the finance is available at low cost to ensure that these joint venture projects can occur.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the state governments build public housing. It is their responsibility to do that and they should. I am pleased to say, whether it was the Western Australian budget or the announcements made by the New South Wales government, that they are doing some things in those areas, and I welcome them doing things in those areas. It was in fact the Reserve Bank governor, as the Treasurer will know, when he was briefing the national cabinet and otherwise, who said, 'It's important for Commonwealth and state governments to be particularly investing in the recovery from the COVID-19 recession.' Just over 2Â½ per cent or thereabouts of the gross state product was being invested by state governments at that time when the Reserve Bank governor actually noted that on social housing projects, an area that state governments are responsible for, states should be doing more. I agree with him. I agree with the Reserve Bank governorâ</span>

                  </a>  and I applaud the state governments that are doing more, because it has been the federal government that have invested over 15 per cent of the size of our economyâ$101 billion aloneâto do what is our responsibility, to stand with those in jobs and to keep them in jobs as part of our JobKeeper program. So the federal government have been doing the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting Australians during this crisis.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Standard &amp; Poor's released their outlook and their rating for Australia and confirmed once again that Australia has retained its AAA credit rating. In that document it says something very important. It says that Australia's economy is beginning to recover. That's what it says. It also goes on to say that we are doing it from a position of fiscal strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we came into the COVID-19 recession, we came into it from a position of fiscal strength because of the work done by our government over these many difficult years to bring the budget back to balance. That enabled us, at the time of crisis for the Australian government, to step in and support Australians, protect lives and protect livelihoods more so than we've ever seen in this country in response to a crisis before. And we could do that from a position of strength. It was that position of strength in our economic management which had already enabled us to move forward to ensure that Australia rebuilt our defence capability in this country with the biggest rebuild of our defence forces since the Second World War. Two per cent of the size of our economy was our commitment, and now it's a reality. In this budget, two per cent of Australia's economy will be spent on defence. It's a commitment that now represents a floor, under our government, for our commitment to defence expenditureânot a ceiling, a floorâand we can go forward. That is enabling Australia to keep Australians safe, to defend and protect our interests and to protect our sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also an important part of the modern manufacturing plan that the minister for industry and the Minister for Defence Industry have been collaborating on. In this budget, a billion dollars of expenditure has been brought forward to be part of the economic recovery plan, both in workforce as well as in capability. I had the privilege to be there, up in Brisbane, to open the MILVEHCOE facilityâsome 450 jobsâwhich is responsible for building the Boxers. There are some 450 jobs, and $150 million already secured from that facility for exports to Hungary. This is one of the most advanced vehicle manufacturing plants for military purposes anywhere in the world, and that has occurred because our government had the commitment and had the vision and had the strength to go and invest in Australia's defence future. That's what our budget's doing. That's what you can do when you manage the economy well and put Australia in a position of strength so it can deal with the crisis and protect Australia's sovereign interests.</span>

Is the government really saying a family on a joint income of $189,000 should be penalised for taking on extra work because the government considers they earn too much?</span>

For a year, those opposite delayed the implementation of our package, and we had to be in a position of negotiating with the crossbench in the Senate, and we were able to come to an agreement with Senator Hinch that enabled our plan to be put in place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once our plan was put in place, there were a number of things that happened. Workforce participation continued to rise to record levels, and female workforce participation rose to record levels, and the gender pay gap went to record lows prior to the COVID-19 recession hitting this country. Those changes also led to out-of-pocket expensesâas a result of the changes we madeâfalling by over three per cent. These are inconvenient facts for those opposite, as is the fact that they opposed those changes for so long and refused to act to support what was a sensible, means-tested and targeted plan that had the desired effect of getting more people into workâgetting more families into work, getting more women into work. That's what those changes produced. The Labor Party opposed those.</span>

Before I call the Prime Minister, in response to the Manager of Opposition Business: up until that very point, I believe the Prime Minister was being relevant, given the scope of the question.

At the point that the Manager of Opposition Business jumped, though, I think the Prime Minister was drifting to another policy topic. He'll need to confine himself to the question.</span>

This is what happened back in 2015: those opposite accused me of designing a systemâthis is what the Labor spokesperson said: 'Wealthy families will be the big winners in the package, with families on incomes of $185,000 pocketing as much as $2Â½ thousand more per year.' The hypocrisy of those opposite on this matter speaks for itself. They're all over the shop.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:11</span>):  I thank the former Geelong star for his question. He'll be very interested, as I know the deputy leader of the Labor Party will be, in Geelong's fortunes on Saturday, when they take on the Richmond Tigers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nicholls is a great electorate, and they are very pleased about the International Freight Assistance Mechanism, which the questioner asked me about. I know that the member for Nicholls kicks a lot of goals. He kicked a lot of goals in his VFL career, and he's kicking more with delivering infrastructure and certainly with IFAM. That has been so, so important. To date, this mechanism has secured the commitment of more than 6,400 freight flights nationwide, carrying more thanâthis is a big statisticâ169,000 tonnes of product, to the value of more than $2Â½ billion. That product may not have gone anywhere but for the assistance provided under the sectorwide aviation assistance that we've put in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Nicholls electorate, there's a company called Ryan Meat Company. It's in Nathalia, a town of 1,900 people. It's a good little town and it's well represented. It's north of Shepparton. The Ryan Meat Company is predominantly geared to the export of chilled lamb to the Middle East. As a result of COVID-19, air freight costs for this business increased from $1.50 a kilo to $6 a kilo. That's a hard hit to their bottom line. In effect, the business virtually stopped overnight. When IFAM was introduced by this government, on 1 April, it saved the Ryan Meat Company and many other companies besides. Linton Ryan, the CEO of Ryan Meat, said, 'The subsidy has allowed our business to keep operating, albeit at reduced levels, however, still providing employment for a hundred people.' In a town such as Nathalia, a hundred peopleâthat's a big industry. That's a major business. A hundred people means kids at school; it means a hundred incomes coming in and washing around the local economy and providing regional capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IFAM has helped pork from Toowoomba, cheese from Begaâthe best cheese there isâcrayfish from Geraldton and salmon from Tasmania to be shipped around the globe. They're just some of the beneficiaries of more than $2.7 billion of sectorwide aviation support that the federal government has provided during this time of crisis. It is a crisis. We know that it's a crisis. That's why we've provided industry support, that's why we provided JobKeeper and JobSeeker and that's why we've put in place those mechanisms to help businesses such as Ryan Meat. Planes in the air, as I say, mean jobs on the ground. It goes right throughout the whole economy. It helps towns such as Nathalia. It helps regional Victoria. We know that, when regional Victoria is strong, so too is Victoria and so too is our nation. We're getting on with the job of supporting businesses such as Ryan Meat and places such as Nathalia in Nicholls.</span>

Holden announced its decision in December 2013, but it said it was due to the competitive pressures of the global automotive market. And Holden said at the time it would be wrong to simply attribute it to the action or inaction on the part of the government. That was the statement by Holden.  They said that in December 2013. That was the Holden plant, but it seems to have escaped the notice of those opposite that Mitsubishi announced its intention to stop local manufacturing in February of 2008. Ford announced its intention to stop local manufacturing in May of 2013.</span>

What I can tell you is that about 75 per cent of former auto supply chain companies remain in business today and 82 per cent of affected workers were able to secure other work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first acts of the coalition government was to get rid of Labor's $1.8 billion FBT hit on the car industry and to scrap the carbon tax, which was estimated to add up to $400 to the cost of every single vehicle manufactured in Australia. The government has helped support the transition of automotive businesses and workers through a range of programs: the $100 million advanced manufacturing fund, the $10 million automotive innovation labs and the $5 million Automotive Engineering Graduate Program. The Volvo truck factory in Wacol, Queensland, was first established in 1972 and is a great example of adapting with the market. They employ more than 500 people. Axiom Precision Manufacturing in South Australia has also pivoted and adapted to the new market. Ford has more than 2,000 engineers, designers and specialists working across four different sites in Australia.</span>

I understand that she is deeply committed to its pursuit and this area, and is doing so in a detailed way. I've been very up-front with the member with respect to the fact that, as a matter of process, we in the government were not inclined to commence and conduct a detailed and extensive national consultation process while most of Australia and, more recently, a large and critical state were still struggling to contain the COVID-19 virus. That sort of consultation around draft legislation is going to be critical, as I think the member appreciates, because of the incredible importance, whatever view you might take, of issues such as retrospectivity, which is probably one of the more difficult issues that any parliament will ever have to resolve with respect to standards such as criminal standards or indeed declarations of corruption.</span>

                  </a>  We have also, though, been very clear what our model for the integrity commission would look like. We've said quite clearly there would be two divisions. There would be a law enforcement division and a public sector integrity division. Each of those divisions would have powers greater than a royal commission. The law enforcement division would maintain discretionary capacity to conduct public hearings. The public sector division would run compulsory private hearings to investigate matters and build a brief which would form the basis of a public prosecution. Each division would have its own-motion powers. Both divisions would be able to investigate what are already a very broad existing suite of public sector offences. They could look at past conduct in that regard. The new commission would also be empowered to investigate with respect to newly created offences, as well as the pre-existing offences. But the government's viewâand it is not a view that is shared universallyâis that there could not be retrospective application of new criminal laws or of declarations of new standards of corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would also note, for the benefit of the member and of members opposite, that that dual structure, which we have been very clear about, also obviously requires the very necessary primary step of expanding the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which would form the first division of our model. In this budget, $9.9 million was allocated to that first stage of the development of this process. Thirty eight more staff have been allocated to expand the jurisdiction of ACLEI in this budgetâto the ATO, to ASIC, to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. That can be achieved by regulation. It will be up and running by 1 January next year. So the first stage, as part of this dual structure, is actually underway in this budget, expanding the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. But these issues are going to require detailed consultation, and that consultation will follow.</span>

I acknowledge her experience as a schoolteacher before coming to this place and as a surf lifesaver today in her local community. She and the other members on the side of the House understand the importance of strong economic management. I can confirm to the House that the economic recovery across the country is now underway: 446,000 jobs were created over the last four months. Last week we saw consumer sentiment increase by 11.9 per cent. That was the single largest increase in a budget month since the series first began in 1974. And today we saw consumer confidence increase for the seventh consecutive week, having recovered 95 per cent of its falls from the start of this pandemic.</span>

Having been out with the member for Robertson in her electorate, I saw the economic recovery underway. We met with an electrician who employs a dozen people on the Central Coast. When he heard our announcement about supporting new apprentices, he decided to go out and hire two new apprentices, including his first female apprenticeâa young, budding electrician. These businesses that have been on JobKeeper are now graduating from JobKeeper as the economic recovery is underway.</span>

And I can confirm that Victoria remains, unfortunately and sadly, the weakest state, with payroll jobs 7.7 per cent lower compared to 14 March. This compares to 3.6 per cent in New South Wales. Tragically, in Victoria, 73,000 jobs have been lost in the last two months. That is nearly 1,200 jobs lost per day.</span>

The payroll jobs data, which the member for Rankin refers to, continues to show the disproportionate impact on younger workers, with jobs for those aged 29 and under still 6.1 per cent lower than the pre-crisis. That compares to 4.1 per cent across all age groups and around 2.7 per cent for those aged 40 to 59. That's why we continue to support JobKeeper, and that's why we continue to support the JobMaker hiring credit. Our focus is on getting all Australians into work and particularly helping those younger people who have been disproportionately hit in the crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Science and Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:28</span>):  I thank the member for his question. I know that he is a very, very passionate advocate for the Australian Made logo and for the manufacturers in his electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first pillar of our Modern Manufacturing Strategy is getting the economic conditions right, particularly for businesses. That's doing things such as driving down the cost of energy. It's lowering taxes. It's creating a skills pipeline. It's making sure that we are doing all that we can to cut red tape. We understand, we know, that getting those economic conditions right for business is going to help them to grow and to create jobsâparticularly the jobs that are needed now and for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I was in the electorate of Longman with the member, and we visited 4x4 Queensland, a great exhaust manufacturing business in his electorate. I'm delighted to say that this week they employed two new workers. These were workers that had been unemployed since the beginning of the year. They turned up yesterday morning on time, ready to go. That's exactly what this government is creatingâopportunities for people to take up jobsâand it's exactly what we want to see happening right around the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the broad support that we're giving to all industries, we have announced the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, which is a $1.5 billion strategy that sits on top of that very solid foundation. It's helping to build competitiveness, resilience and scale for our industries in some key priority sectors. It's important to understand that, as manufacturers scale up, they will bring with them the small businesses and the medium enterprises. We want businesses to have confidence and we want them to have the opportunity to grow, and that's what this policy will deliver in spades. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked about alternative approaches, and those opposite certainly do have an alternative approach, and unfortunately it's not particularly confidence inspiring. They've actually got a train wreck of a policy on manufacturing. It is centred on begging the states to build trains. Well, good luck with that. Even if it all goes to plan, today the member for Gorton has revealed that that strategy mightâif they're lucky, if everything goes to planâdeliver up to 659 jobs. Well, compare that to what we're doing. Our Modern Manufacturing Strategy is conservatively estimated to produce 80,000 direct jobs. So here's Labor's manufacturing strategy, with 659 jobs, and here's the coalition's. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is an airport that is going to return $1.80 for every dollar of investment, an airport that is supporting 11,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction and, indeed, 28,000 jobs post construction, within five years of opening. That is significant. It's an airport Labor would never ever have built. It's the type of infrastructure that Labor never supported in six failed years of government. I remember, certainly, the last three of them. The department, of course, is taking the matter of the airport and Leppington very seriously, and it's been the subject of Senate estimates. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and acknowledge his strong focus on liquid fuel security. As a regional member, he knows how important that is for his electorate. He also knows that we've recently announced a $200 million program to increase our diesel fuel storages. He knows that diesel is absolutely critical for emergency services and for electricity back-up. Like we saw during the recent 'black summer', it is so critical in managing bushfires in places like the North Coast of New South Wales. It is also vital in maintaining the distribution of our food products and medicine products and keeping our big exporters prosperous. Our miners and our farmers need diesel every day of the week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're creating a minimum stock holding obligation which will increase the diesel storage requirement by 40 per cent. We are backing our local refineries who play such a critical role in our fuel security in this country. This builds on the action that we have already taken to establish the first ever government owned crude oil stocks. We did that at a time of record low oil pricesâa good deal for taxpayers. There has been a lot of support for our plan. The Australian Trucking Association has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ ensure that farmers can continue to grow the food and fibre we rely on without the fear of having supply chain disruptions due to shortages of liquid fuels.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we are focused on affordable, reliable, secure liquid fuels and energy, the members opposite are focused on themselves. They have no plan for affordable energy, they have no plan for liquid fuels, they have no plan for gas and they have no plan to meet their Paris treaty obligationsâno plan at all. They are paralysed by indecision and division, and their dysfunction has spilled onto the front pages of the papers. You have the member for Isaacs calling the member for Hunter unparliamentary names that I won't repeat in this placeânot that that would bother the member for Hunter very much. In the same article, it was reported that a Labor MP said Mr Butler was 'failing on the politics of climate and energy' and referred to the member for Hindmarsh as being 'as useless as a vegan in a butcher's shop'. </span>

As I stated in my previous answer, with 11,000 jobs during construction and 28,000 jobs within five years of opening in 2026, this is going to be and is a significant investment in Western Sydney.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up in Leichhardt, in the Far North, there's a little place called Weipa. It is on the west coast of the cape. It's actually a very important mining centre for the bauxite industry. In fact, almost half of the local population in Weipa work at the mine. It's a critical contributor to Australian industry, and of course to Australia's economy and, more importantly, the Queensland economy.</span>

But, from Bunbury to Weipa, every individual knows that we all need to do more. As part of our economic recovery plan, we have strategic basins plansâfive of themâto be developed in a program worth $28.3 million over the next three years. There's the Beetalooâand of course I acknowledge the work of the minister for energy up in the Beetaloo last week, looking at exactly what that resource can provideâand also into the north Bowen, to the Galilee, across Queensland.</span>

He's burly. He's bearded. He's got a handshake like a bear. He's rough as hessian underwear, to be frank! But his business actually started in 2007 with a team of just three. What does he do now? He runs 12 rigs, he employs 76 people, he employs four apprentices, he has three trainee drillers and he won the Queensland Mining Contractor of the Year award at the Queensland Mining Awards just a few weeks ago. We need more people like Steve and his company. We need more individuals out there working in the resources sector, in particular in Queensland. </span>

In Queensland, they simply have no plan for resources whatsoever. None! Those opposite, Labor's environmental action network, want no gas. No gas appliances. They want to knock out the resources sector. There is some slight resistance over there. It's not much. The member for Hunterâthe General Custer of the Labor Party. It's Little Bighorn for the Labor Party at the moment, for the member for Hunter. His left flank won't be overrun. It's turned and fixed bayonets.

And the member for Ballarat is within earshot of me. What I said was, in time, when we look back at this, we will say, 'At least the land next to the Western Sydney airport is Commonwealth owned.'  It would cost a lot more in the future, had it not been bought now. In that particular interview, I was also espousing the importance of Western Sydney airport. We are getting on with the job of building Western Sydney airport, something that never would have happened under those oppositeânever would have happened. </span>

                  </a>  I know that. You know that. We all know that. Thirty million dollarsâthat's why we are looking into the fact of how much and why it cost that much. We're looking into that. There is a review being done. The department asked the Australian Federal Police, as did the ANAO, to look into that matter. It's being conducted by the Australian Federal Police. Yes, there are separate inquiries going on. The department itself asked the AFP to investigate it, as did the ANAOâand the member for Ballarat knows all about the ANAO!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I thank the honourable member for his question. All Australians know that the Morrison government is determined to keep Australians safe. In particular, we're determined to keep kids safe online, to make sure that we can support small businesses who are operating online and to make sure that we can support older Australians as they do their banking or they share photos or emails with their kids who might be in another part of the country or overseas. We know that this is an incredibly important environment for Australians to operate in. Increasingly, of course, because of COVID people are spending more and more time online. In this budget we have taken decisions to invest more into protecting Australians online. It doesn't stop there. We have been able to invest, this year alone, $8.2 billion in the Home Affairs portfolio. In the 2019-20 budget the government provided an additional $571.4 million over five years to security agencies to help keep Australians safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the proudest outcomes of this government, in my judgement, is the fact that we have been able to manage the budget well over the course of the last number of years. With the Prime Ministerâas Treasurer, now as Prime Ministerâin this budget we have prepared Australia as best we can not only to deal with COVID but also to deal with the threats, including terrorism, which have not gone away. The investment that we've made additionally into the Australian Federal Police, which is significant in this budgetâ$300 million over four years to enhance the AFP's search capacity and ability to respond to emerging threatsâis designed to defeat those terrorists. It's designed to defeat paedophiles. It's designed to defeat all of those who are involved in activities that most Australians don't know anything about: the underworld, the dark web, the networks that these criminal syndicates operate seek to do us harm, seek to profit at the expense of Australian citizens. We've invested in a way that the Labor Party was never able to do. We have created a strong budget and we have put ourselves in a position as a country where we're able to deal with those threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Labor Party was in government they ran out of money to list important medicines. They ripped $128 million out of the Federal Police. They had $30 million removed from the Australian crime commission and 88 staff. They took $27 million and 56 staff from AUSTRAC. They took $735 million and 700 staff from the then customs agency. They did it because they had to spend $16 billion on the border failures that they presided over and the decisions that they made otherwiseâpink batts, all of that crazy spendingâthat meant that the Labor Party ran out of money. They can never manage money. They can never manage the budget in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  That's right. So, on that, I do want to rule. There are two things about the question. The bit about representations to the government generallyâthat can be asked. Whether that knowledge is reasonable to expect is another thing, to be frankâwhether it's reasonable to know every aspect of every part of the government. What I was conscious ofâand this is why I was listening to the Leader of the House so intently, because I'd formed a view and was listening closelyâwas that, if the question was going to the Prime Minister's previous portfolio responsibilities, that would be out of order. So what I'll say to the Prime Minister is that that is a very strong convention, and he was the minister for immigration several years ago. The only bit that is in order is the bit to him as Prime Minister, and the first part about other parts of the governmentâbut I point out that it's not up to me whether it's reasonable or not to expect him to be able to answer that, but that's also why we have questions on notice. I'll call the Prime Minister.</span>

The Morrison government is investing an historic $270 billion over the next decade in our defence capability, and I am particularly proud of our defence spend in regional Australia, backing regional jobs and backing regional businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our record investment is driving our economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession, including in the member's home state of New South Wales. Like the member for Lindsay, my friend and colleague and senator for New South Wales Hollie Hughes has done an outstanding job of backing the local defence industry in the Hunter region. Over the last month, Senator Hughes and I have had the great pleasure of announcing over $50 million worth of investment in the Hunter region alone. The local contractors have got the benefit of being involved in a number of local projects, like our investment of $42 million in the iconic Singleton military base. Importantly, some 82 per cent of the subcontract packages will go to local Hunter businesses. That is great news for them and great news for that region. There will be around 650 regional jobs created by this project over a two-year construction period. In more good news for the Hunter, we also announced the investment of $3.2 million in the Hunter based firm Armor Composite Engineering, who are developing protective curved body armour for the ADF. In addition to this, we announced an investment of $7 million in Newcastle based BlueZone Group to develop unmanned surface vehicle technology for our men and women in uniform. These New South Wales businesses have benefited significantly from our investment in innovation through our Defence Innovation Hub.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all ideas that are good come from the city, and I think I've just demonstrated that with those great examples from the Hunter region. There are great ideas in regional Australia that will deliver for the defence of our nation. That's why we continue to back those excellent regional businesses in the Hunter region, and we'll continue to support the growth of the Australian defence industry with another $800 million available for good ideas, with respect to the Defence Innovation Hub, helping to create more jobs and driving defence industry businesses as we recover from this COVID-19 recession.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I thank the member for Mallee for her question. She more than anyone understands agriculture's heavy reliance traditionally and presently on overseas workers to undertake the seasonal picking of our harvests. Traditionally that's come through the Working Holiday Maker program. Since COVID-19, we've gone from around 142,000 working holiday-makers to just over 63,000. That's always been complemented by the Pacific and seasonal worker programs. There's about 6,000 to 8,000 of those running around the country supporting Australian agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why when COVID was first detected in Australia we took pre-emptive steps to make sure that that cohort was encouraged to stay in Australia and, particularly, to stay in agriculture. We said to them if they worked in agriculture they could extend their visas for another 12 months. Subsequently, in August, we were able to reopen the seasonal and Pacific worker programs, and the 10 participating countries have all signed upâin fact, we've already had pilots for mango pickers in Darwin. States are responsible for working with their specific industries and working through the quarantine measure to make sure that a COVID-safe environment is provided not only to the workers but to the Australian public. We continue to work with them. Then, in September, we took to national cabinet an ag workers code. All states, bar Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia, signed up to that. It's a very important measure, because it keeps the free movement of workforce, in a COVID-safe way, across the state borders, keeping the supply chains movingâunderstanding that our agricultural production systems are integrated right across this country. It's important that we understood that, and we encourage all those states that haven't signed up to do so. This will be pivotal as we get further into the season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've also done as part of this is to acknowledge that every one of those jobs is to be given to an Australian first if they wish to take it. Every job must be market tested. An Australian gets first crack at these. What we've said is that we want to encourage Australians to take up these roles, understanding that some of those who are on JobSeeker today will be thousands of kilometres away from where these jobs are. So the government, in the budget, announced that up to $6,000 can be claimed back in travel expensesâfuel, accommodationâto travel the country to try to help farmers. We look to young Australians in particular, who may not have family commitments, to be able to take up an incentive and an acceleration towards youth allowance. If they earn over $15,000, they'll accelerate their ability to take up youth allowance, particularly if they go back to uni next year. This will put money in their pocket to go back to uni but also give them the ability to have youth allowance to start their education with money in their pocket and ease the burden on them financially.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian farmers are not looking for charity; they're actually just looking for Australians to get out there, have a go and give them a hand in one of the best seasons we've seen in many years.</span>

This has been a very, very busy time for Australia Post, with parcel volumes up by a very high percentage, and, of course, Australia Post has been able to respond, thanks to the temporary registry relief we've provided, by moving 2,000 staffâpostiesâto being able to deliver parcels so Australians can get their parcels when they need them. With millions of Australians at home, they need their parcels.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  That's a good idea. I take the point of order. It was a specific question but, in how the minister was relating the material to it, I believe he was answering it, right until the point at which the Manager of Opposition Business jumped up. I thought the reason you were jumping up was that he was going to alternative policies, so I'm going to say to him now: you can't do that. But he's not compelled, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> makes clear, to simply answer a question with 'yes' or 'no'. I know that's what the questioner would like, but that is not how our system works, and if people wanted it to work that way I'd have to change the standing orders. What he says, as the Leader of the House pointed out, is in fact being relevant and answering the question.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FLETCHER:</span>
                  </a>  I thank the Speaker for the opportunity to continue to address the question that is of importance to all Australians, which is: what would we expect of Australia Post at this very challenging time? What would we expect of Australia Post's board and management at this challenging time? What we'd expect them to do is to be able to respond to a difficult set of business circumstances, where essentially overnight they've faced challenges like most of the scheduled airline services in Australia ceasing. Australia Post use scheduled airline services, in normal times, to deliver parcels and letters all around the country. So what have they done? They have chartered more than 10 aircraft, which are flying around the country to keep Australians served. They've dealt with the challenge. Because of the heavy-handed lockdown in Melbourne, all of a sudden there were very intense restrictions on the number who could be employed in the sorting centres. That had an impact not only on services in Victoria but around Australia, because the core of their sorting operations is in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the kinds of business and operational questions you would expect a capable board and management to deal with, and that is what they've been focused on. We've seen revenue of $7.5 billion this year. We've also seen a very sharp increase in the volume of parcels being delivered, as Australians at home, in their millions, have resorted to e-commerce. Australia Post has a very large market share when it comes to delivering parcels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of their response to the demand for parcels and the adjustments they're making so that staff can be redeployed to the areas of growthâa very sensible proposition which was put forward by the Australia Post board and management and which the government had no hesitation in supportingâI think we can say that Australia Post is dealing with a difficult set of challenges. In doing that, they have responded well to meeting the needs of Australians. All of us can ask: do we have confidence in the board and management of Australia Post? We on this side of the House sayâwhat a radical proposition!â'Let's judge them by the quality of the services and the outcomes of their delivery.' That's what we do on this side of the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I thank the member for Ryan, who, in his first term, is showing that he's a champion for his constituents and, importantly, for the residential construction industry in his electorate. I can report to the member for Ryan and to the House that the Morrison government is providing unprecedented support to this industry, which employs, directly and indirectly, up to a million Australians. Through the HomeBuilder programâgrants of $25,000 to purchase a new home or undertake a substantial rebuildâwe have seen phenomenal outcomes, through the latest statistics. I report to the House that the HIA have reported that new home sales are up 49.8 per cent. That's 49.8 per cent in the middle of a pandemic. They're not our statistics; they're those of the Housing Industry Association. We've also seen, from the ABS, that loans for the construction of new dwellings are up 22.9 per cent, or 34 per cent throughout the year. That's the highest level in a decade. When we put together the HomeBuilder program, our expectation was that it would support the industry and ensure it continued. Not in our wildest dreams did we think it would lead to the best results that we've seen for 10 years. We've seen ABS first home data prove that the majority of people taking up these opportunities are first home buyersâanother key commitment of the Morrison government, being the champions for first home buyers throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Ryan is very well connected in his electorate. He was speaking to his constituent Bob Sharpless. Bob manages the Springfield City development. He said that this time last year they were selling 20 blocks a month. In April they sold 10 blocks. In June, after HomeBuilder was announced, from 10 blocks, they sold 81. That's a 400 per cent increase in the Springfield City development. What does that mean, Mr Speaker? That means tradies on site. That means the entire supply chainâthe manufacturing workers who make the bricks, tiles and glass and the timber mill workers who make the frames and the trusses. It supports an ecosystem throughout this country, from Tasmania and Western Australia to New South Wales and Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to all of that, in the midst of the HomeBuilder success, we announced in the budget an additional 10,000 places under the very successful First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, with one additional requirement: that first home buyers use those places to purchase a new home. On top of HomeBuilder, that is going to continue to support one million jobs throughout the country, including in the member's electorate.</span>

A public statement, as far as the <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ractice</span> is concerned, is simply that. Now, I understand the point the Leader of the House is making, but that doesn't preclude the minister being asked about it. What the minister says in response is his or her business.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Can I thank the member for Reid for her question. She brings enormous experience to this House as a former psychologist and, of course, has been a magnificent advocate for her multicultural community there in Western Sydney. She, like so many of us in this House, knows that our nation has been built on immigration. People from around the world come here and make a contribution to this nation and are welcomed with open arms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget this year, we made three changes to support people making a contribution, particularly those who come in on partner visas. The first is that we doubled the number of partner visas to more than 72,000, so that more spouses or partners of Australians can settle here permanently. The second is that we relaxed all the restrictions on migrants accessing free English language classes, which basically means that now anybody can access those free English language classes for as long as they need to be able to get themselves up to a decent level of English.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, from late 2021, we're placing new requirements on partner visa applications that they at least have to make a reasonable effort to learn English when they are here, if they don't already have functional English. By reasonable efforts, we mean they have to make a fair go at doing some of those free English language classes. There's no hard and fast test that we'll be applying. We want them to take advantage of those free English language classes while they're here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we asking them to do that? It is because we know that English language is so critical to getting a job. When you look at the data, only 13 per cent of people in Australia with no English are in work today, which is extraordinary. This is quite different to what it was like in the fifties and sixties, when people could come in without English and go immediately into the workforce. Today's workforce is different. Because of health and safety requirements, you do need that English language capability. Of course, it's important to be able to fully participate in our democracy and for social cohesion reasons as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been warmly supported by multicultural leaders across Australia. It's been supported, for example, by the president of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, who said that this decision couldn't have come at a better time. It's a decision welcomed by the Vietnamese community. The former president of the Chinese association of Australia welcomed it, as did the president of the Muslim Women's Association and the former president of the Indian federations of Australia. A good measure, it's a sensible measure and it supports migrants.</span>

We congratulate Anika and Finn, and indeed I'm sure I speak on behalf of everyone in the House when I say it is quite extraordinary that a member of our national parliament has had twins while in office.

                  <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  I want to start my remarks by speaking directly to the people of Victoria. Months ago the people of Victoria faced a fork in the road. In August, Victoria experienced a daily peak of 725 COVID-19 cases. At the same time, the United Kingdom was experiencing 891 cases a day. This morning Victoria recorded one new case. Yesterday the United Kingdom recorded 19,000 cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was not inevitable. Victoria could have gone down the United Kingdom's road. This result is a testament to the people of Victoriaâall Victorians. It's a testament to the children who've missed out on birthday parties. It's a testament to the friends and families who haven't attended the funerals of loved ones. It's a testament to businesses that have kept their doors shut despite their love of their business. And, yes, it's a testament to the tough and difficult decisions taken by Premier Andrews and his government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support on this side of the House goes to the people of Victoria and the Victorian government just as it went to the people and government of Tasmania as they dealt with the outbreak in the north-west of Tasmania, just as it went and goes to the people and government of New South Wales as they deal with the outbreaks in Sydney. COVID-19 is not a matter of jurisdiction and it should not be a matter of party politics. This virus won't be defeated anywhere until it's defeated everywhere, and we all have a stake in our shared success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as Victorians have undertaken this massive effort, they've endured a federal government and cabinet ministers taking cheap shots at them and their governmentâa conga line of cabinet ministers champing at the bit to criticise Victoria and its government, pretending that they're epidemiologists when actually they're just politicians. The Morrison government has put marketing before medicine when it comes to the people of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't meant to be this way. The government told us, when it suited them politically, that we were all in this together. Back in March, announcing the so-called national cabinet, the Prime Minister in thanking the states and territories thanked them for their strong sense of unity, cooperation and purpose. That was a long time ago. The Minister for Health, never short of hyperbole, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ people will look back on this National Cabinet as being one of the most amazing achievements of the Federation in Australia's first 200 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Federation is only 120 years old. He already regards it as better than World War II and he's claiming the next 80 years as well! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national cabinet did play a role, I acknowledge, because, when the Prime Minister was still saying he was going to go to the football, Premier Andrews and Premier Berejiklian dragged him to tougher lockdowns through the national cabinet, dragged him to the restrictions that were necessary to save the lives of Australians. The Prime Minister said in March:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ everybody's working together. There's no quibbling â¦ We'll just get on and do it, because that's what we all owe it to you to keep you safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually agree with the Prime Minister then, not the Prime Minister now. I agree with what he said then. That is what they owe the Australian people, but it's not what they have delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen cabinet minister after cabinet minister line up to criticise Victoria and its response. Head of the queue, as is often the case, has been none other than the Treasurer. We all know the Treasurer loves a headline. We know the most dangerous place to be in Parliament House is between the Treasurer and a TV cameraâdon't find yourself there! He's always got advice to give to the states on how to do better and to business on how to do better, but now he's reached a new low. Just yesterday he accused the Premier of Victoria of 'bloody-mindedness', 'stubbornness' and 'making it up as he goes'. This is from a Treasurer who said as recently as August:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But I'm not serving Victorians or Australians by engaging in a slanging match.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, no, he's not. He would not be serving Australians and Victorians by engaging in a slanging match, but engaging in a slanging match is exactly what he's doing now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incidentally, I saw the handiwork of some of the Treasurer's infamous backgrounding and networking on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today. Faithfully reporting, it said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Political observers have noted heâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the Treasurerâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">is a popular figure in his own state, winning 48,928 first-preference votes in his seat of Kooyong at the 2019 election while Mr Andrews received 19,649 votes in his state electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder who those political observers might beâmaybe sources close to the Treasurer's office? But, knowing that state electorates and federal electorates are a different size, I did a quick exercise and found that Mr Frydenberg received 49.4 per cent of the primary vote but Mr Andrews received 56.7 per cent of his primary vote. If the Treasurer thinks that 49 per cent makes him more popular than 57 per cent, maybe we have an insight into how he lost $60 billion in his costings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Close behind the Treasurer has been the acting minister for immigration. The acting minister for immigration has been arguing that the New South Wales and Victorian figures are similar and so, therefore, the restrictions should be similarâagain, pretending to be an epidemiologist. On the face of it, yes, New South Wales and Victoria have had similar figures. In the last 14 days, Victoria has had 108 cases and New South Wales has had 105. But if the acting minister for immigration bothered to do some research he'd know that in New South Wales 55 of those cases have come from overseas and no cases in Victoria have come from overseas, for obvious reasons. They have all come from community transmission, which is a very different set of arrangements. So my advice to the acting minister for immigration is to do his job, get the travel bubble right and not blame other people. And maybe the acting minister for immigration might want to consider not engaging in conduct which can only be described as criminal. That might be my advice to the acting minister for immigration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of a pattern of behaviour by these ministers in this government. When they had the chance months ago, they stood at the dispatch box and demanded Premier Palaszczuk open her borders to Victoria and everywhere else. Imagine if she'd listened to them. Imagine the catastrophe in Queensland if she'd opened the borders when they said. She was right and they were wrong. I wonder if they'd have apologised if she'd actually listened to them. I wonder if they'd have apologised to her for that poor advice. Don't forget that this government, to their shame, intervened in a Federal Court case to back their preference buddy, their advertising buddy Clive Palmer, to undermine public health and undermine the government of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know this activity by cabinet ministers serves a purpose for this government. It's a distraction from their failures. They want Victoria to open up more quickly. We'd all like to see Victoria open up more quickly, no-one more so than our Victorian colleagues. Maybe Victoria could open up more quickly if we had a COVIDSafe app that worked, if the federal government's responsibility was met. We've had 27,000 cases in Australia. There would have been hundreds of thousands of contacts of those 27,000 cases. Do you know how many contacts have been traced by the COVIDSafe app without assistance from manual tracers? There have been 14 cases traced by the COVIDSafe app. There was $70 million spent on development and marketing. That's a cost of $5 million per contact. I've seen better value from land deals at Badgerys Creek airport under this government than from the COVIDSafe app. It has been a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. The Prime Minister told us that cruise ships would arrive under bespoke arrangementsâ'under the direct command of Border Force', he told us. Yet we've seen the disaster that was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. Then, most tragically of all, we've seen the disaster in aged care, which is the direct constitutional responsibility of the federal government. There have been 683 deaths of elderly Australians under a minister, the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, who, I regret to tell the House, is simply not up to the job. The president of the Australian Medical Association put it well when he said, 'COVID-19 took the world by surprise, but its effects on Australia's aged-care system were entirely predictable.' That's right. They were predictable because aged care under this government is underfunded, undervalued and underinvested in, because the regulator has been asleep at the wheel on this government's watch. And it's all their responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know these eventsâthis commentary, this undermining of Victoria's responseâhave real consequences. There are plenty of conspiracy theories, plenty of people who say that we shouldn't have these restrictions and that we shouldn't have these lockdowns. There's plenty of undermining out there. We have to accept that and understand that, but not from the federal government, because Victorians, Western Australians and Queenslanders deserve better than that. When it comes to this government, when this Prime Minister has the choice between uniting and dividing, he will divide every time. When he has the choice between substance and spin he will go for spin. He has put marketing ahead of medicine. He has played politics with the pandemic. This has had real consequences for Australiansânot just Victorians but all Australiansâand this Prime Minister is responsible for that. He's responsible for the conduct of his cabinet ministers. He's responsible for the conduct of his Treasurer and his acting minister for immigration and all the others. He's responsible, but he won't take responsibility. But that's what we've come to expect from Scott Morrison as Prime Minister.</span>

That's what he looks like when he comes in here and carries on with such rot. To people listening, Australians don't agree with him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, 2020, has been a tough year, with COVID-19, this international pandemic, and for no-one more than year 12 students. I wish the best for all year 12 students, not just those in my own electorate of Petrie but those around Queensland and right around the country at the moment, who are studying for exams and are about to enter the workforce or go on and do further study. I wish them all the best. The Morrison government has been with them as well. I know that the Minister for Education in the Morrison government has ensured that the Education Council will ensure that every year 12 student who is finishing this year will get a leaving certificate, a completion ATAR guaranteed, this year. That's important because it's been a tough year for year 12s. I know: my oldest son is in year 12 this year. He's currently studying for exams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is focused on delivering for all Australians the economic lifeline that they need at the moment, at this point in time, to get through this year of 2020, this unique year of global pandemic. We're building confidence and momentum in our economy for the future so that we can sustain a strong economy for all Australians in all electorates represented here in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are creating jobsâor businesses are creating jobsâto keep Australian families going and support workers who need that work to pay their mortgages and so forth. In the recent budget we've announced, in many different ways, support for Australians. The other day when I was driving down my street I stopped and spoke to a fellow who was painting, Mr Dayne Baker from Allscale Brushworx in Clontarf. He's currently got eight staff and he's actually been able to hire two additional apprentices just in the last few weeks because of what the Morrison government is doing in paying half of their wages. Dayne said, 'The government incentive was a big factor in hiring two new apprentices,' and, while growing his business, he saw this as an important opportunity to use this program to help local people back into employment at this difficult time. I want to thank Dayne and so many others like him around the country that are hiring apprentices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, the Prime Minister and I were in Aspley with Luke Camilleri at Grand Prix Mazda. His father, Joe, started that company over 50 years ago. They've become a powerhouse. They have over 120 staff in Aspley alone. Once again, we were meeting apprentices there whose wages were being paid at the moment. Luke said that, during the height of the pandemic, JobKeeper was a big influence in helping keep their staff connected. The instant asset write-off has also been a phenomenal help for Grand Prix Mazda in Aspley. Kris at Cafe Diversity in Redcliffe was telling me that he was very thankful that they had been able to survive through COVID thanks to the Morrison government's JobKeeper program. They lost 80 per cent of their business overnight at the height of this pandemic and were in desperate need of support, which was given to them by the Australian government. He said that, thanks to those payments, they have re-emerged and are now on the hunt for an apprentice chef and a manager for the cafe. So, if you're in my electorate and looking for work, get onto SEEK, because right now Cafe Diversity is hiring an apprentice and a manager. Make sure you have a look. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Brisbane would agree that the tax cuts have been a great help to so many Australians. What a great time to hand back people's hard-earned money to them when they need a little bit of extra support. What it means is that a retail worker in, say, Sydney, Melbourne or Perth will get $2,160 more back in their pocket this year compared to 2017-18. That's a big difference. It's an extra $1,080 in the hand. That was passed just a fortnight ago. That's a great incentive for young workers. A tradie earning $80,000 a year will get $2,160 back. A teacher earning $120,000 a year will benefit by getting $2,745 back in their pocket this year compared to 2017-18. We know those tax cuts encourage more people into the workforce, which brings more income tax for the federal government for us to invest in essential services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transport and road infrastructure have been increased big time right around the country. There are so many new roads being built. The only downside in my own electorate in Queensland is that the Palaszczuk government has been really slow to act here, and it's one of the big disappointments that all Queensland members have to deal with. Right now, it's taking four years from the time a road is announced to when the first sod is turned. I think of Beams Road in my own electorate. The Palaszczuk government announced in 2017 that they'd upgrade it. It won't even start till next year. That's four years until a sod is turned. I ask Queenslanders to look at that when voting on 31 October and to consider the LNP alternative up there, with Deb Frecklington and her team, who have a plan to get Queensland going again. I know Amanda Cooper in Aspley has been fighting hard and has a great track record of representation, and so do Kerri-Anne Dooley in Redcliffe and Yvonne Barlow in Murrumba. So there's a lot happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to talk a little bit about my own portfolio of homelessness and some of the things that we're doing there, too. One of the things I did recently, in a bipartisan way, with the Queensland state minister was write to every boarding house in Queensland. At the last census, throughout Australia, there were some 17,800 homeless people living in boarding houses. This joint letter from me and the state minister spoke about improving tenure for tenantsârather than giving them a week-by-week lease, ensure they have three monthsâand also ensuring that they have privacy outside of their own room. That's a way boarding house owners can act to help those tenants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Home ownership has obviously been a big part of the Morrison government's plan, with an additional 10,000 places in the extension of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme; the $25,000 tax-free grant for eligible owner-occupiers, including first home buyers, through HomeBuilder 2020, which has been going gangbusters, as we heard the minister for housing say in question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Indigenous Australians, the Morrison government is fulfilling its election commitment of finalising the agreement with the Queensland government to deliver better housing for Indigenous people. And Indigenous Business Australia will see an additional investment of $150 million over the next three years to deliver 360 home loans for new housing construction in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is support for older and disabled Australians and their families through a targeted capital gains tax exemption for granny flat arrangements where there is a formal written agreement in place.

Christian Larsen, the CEO, told me that this will help create more jobs and it will help create more exports.

We are out there providing for all Australians, ensuring that, during this difficult time, Australians get the help they need. We hear nothing but negativity from the opposition. We heard it from the member for McMahon and we'll hear it from the member for Newcastle or whoever is speaking next. We hear about everything that is bad about this country. At the moment, what we are focused on is the Australian people and delivering for them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>): I would like to start by acknowledging the hard work and sacrifice of all the people in my community of Dunkley over the year 2020, which has been so much more than a challenge. I acknowledge your solidarity and sense of community in pulling together to help those who are finding it more difficult than others to deal with the public health pandemic and the economic recession that we find ourselves in. You have all been magnificent, and I know that you will continue to be so as we work our way through this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a short time, it appeared that the Prime Minister and his government had heard the plaintive call of Australians for political leaders across jurisdictions, for people from all parties and political backgrounds, to work together in the public interest. It did. Granted, it took a global pandemic, and the Prime Minister couldn't find it in himself to include the federal opposition in this 'cooperative approach' no matter how many times we offered to be part of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's words were that there is 'a strong sense of unity, cooperation and purpose'.' So Australians I think for a little while saw a glimmer of hope. They really did. They thought they had a Prime Minister, a Treasurer and a health minister who were holding out the promise of working cooperatively with anyone who wanted to deal with the imperative before them. As the Prime Minister said in March, 'Everyone's working together, no quibbling. That's what we owe to you.' That's what he said to Australians: 'That's what we owe to you.' Sadly, tragically in fact, it seems that that commitment had a use-by date, or maybe it was just all words after all. What we have seen in Victoria lately, what my community who are working so hard to put those words into practice have seen, is a litany of political attacks, and personal insults and attacksâfrom federal ministers, cabinet ministersâagainst the state government. As we are working hard to suppress the second wave and get through it, we've seen a federal government, notwithstanding that the Treasurer said in August that he wasn't 'serving Australians or Victorians by engaging in a slanging match', doing just that. The Treasurer was right then when he said it and he's right now, that that is not serving Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the spirit of cooperation and purpose, of working together in the national interest for all Australians, I have a list of things that the Treasurer and the federal government should have been focusing on when they were instead playing political games. It's not too late to adopt any or all of these suggestions. I invite the government to do just that for the sake of my community in Dunkley and for the sake of all of Australia. In no particular order, just off the top of my head, here's a list. You could restore JobKeeper to Victorian childcare workers. You could support Victorian businesses and workers by keeping JobKeeper at its initial level, by extending it to those people who missed out and by helping us get through the second wave and come out of it. You can commit to keeping JobSeeker at decent levels after December and not return it to below the poverty line at $40 a day. You can provide targeted support to the travel industry for travel agents who, through no fault of their own, have lost all of their business for now and the foreseeable future and were left out of the federal budget. You could provide support for workers over 35 who've lost their jobs and can't see where their next job will come from. You could make sure that this federal government lets Victorians leave the country to say goodbye to dying relatives in other countries. You could help Australians and Victorians to come home when, through no fault of their own, they've found themselves in another countryâno job, no family, no support and they can't come home. You could find a credible woman, because I can guarantee you there are lots of us around, to explain why the budget not only is not gender neutral but abandons women and female dominated industries to look after themselves through the biggest economic and health crisis in more than a century. You could invest in affordable child care as an economic and a social imperative. You could have a real climate change policy, an energy policy that you stick to for more than 22 seconds and make sure that Australia is a renewable energy superpower. I've got so many things and I'm not going to get to say them all in this short time. You could ask the arts minister to actually come up with an arts and cultural policy and support the $111 billion industry that's been decimated. You could actually invest in the Public Service to have capacity to plan for disasters and the future. The list goes on. I can tell you if you come and talk to me. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It got really weird for me when the member for McMahon not only came in and criticised that but then lauded and celebrated the effort of Dan Andrews in Victoria. Work that out. If you went out and walked down any main street of any town or city in this country and you asked, 'How do you think Australia is going with the COVID pandemic both medically and economically?' they'd say, 'Not too bad.' If you said, 'What about Victoria?' they'd say, 'Victoria's the blight on it actually.' Victoria mismanaged it. Dan Andrews has mismanaged the situation. News flash to those opposite: Victoria have not done well with the pandemic on any comparison. If you look at the contagion rates of the virus in Victoriaâand, very sadly, if you look at the fatality rates in Victoriaârelative to anywhere else in this country, Victoria has done badly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOGAN:</span>
                  </a>  Member for Newcastle, go grab the newspaper or go google it and see how Victoria has done relative to the rest of the country. Obviously, you're going to be surprised. You should not be in here saying, 'What a great job Dan Andrews has done!' There's an inquiry going on into the quarantine system, and the inquiry will find that the Labor government of Victoria mismanaged it. So, newsflash to those opposite, to the member for McMahon, to the member for Newcastle: Victoria is not something of which you should be saying, 'Well done,' because it has been the blight on the whole statistics for Australia, both pandemically and economically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I feel for Victorians. The rest of us across Australia have looked at the situation down there and at all the restrictions that were placed on them. The damage done to people's mental health and livelihoodsânot to mention to the health of those who've contracted the virusâhas been catastrophic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, you may also be surprisedâgiven that you're not aware of the situation in Victoriaâthat, compared to just about every country throughout the world, Australia has done very well, and, if it wasn't for Victoria, we'd have done even better. If you look at our infection rates and our fatality ratesâalbeit each of them is a tragedyâours are very low, compared to other countries around the world. Why? Because we got on top of it early. We declared this a pandemic well before the World Health Organization said we should. We had international restrictions so that, very early on, people were stopped from coming from other countries around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state, New South Wales, the state government implemented wonderful contact tracing systems and social distancing, and hand hygiene standards as well. I want to acknowledge everyone thereâand Victorians as well. I think every Australian has realised the importance of social distancing and hand hygiene and has got behind them, which is why we have done so very wellâagain, as I say, except for Victoria's mismanagement of this virus. Again, there's an inquiry going on into that, about quarantining and everything else, and it will come up with exactly what the reason is for how they stuffed that up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But anyway, it's great that every other state and the federal government got on top of this, and the statistics for us are very good. But, again, to laud the Victorian government is crazy. So, again, newsflash: federally, we've done very well; the state Labor government in Victoria has done very badly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, there's been an economic thing brought on by this as well, Deputy Speaker O'Brien. I say this to you respectfully, because I probably don't really want you to imagine this, but imagine if, federally, Labor was in government as well! I mean, seriously! Member for Brisbane, where would we be at, economically? And would the federal Labor government have done as badly as the state Labor government with the pandemic management and also economically?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Economically, though we are facing great challenges, I want to quote to you from an S&amp;P media release, from today, I think, saying the Morrison government's balance sheet was strong before the pandemic. You know why it was strong before the pandemic? Because Australia's budget had improved in recent years. So, economically, we're managing this too. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  [by video link] Well, I'll tell you what we wouldn't have done: if federal Labor were in government, we wouldn't have supported Clive Palmer in the courts in WA to make Mark McGowan open up the borders! That's what we wouldn't have done, Member for Page. If you want to know what it looks like to see the federal government abandon Victorians, listen to the drivel that came out of the previous member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I start my contribution by, unlike the previous speaker, actually saying thank you to Victorians. Victorians have spent some of the most difficult days of our state at home. We've worn masks. We've stayed away from friends and family. Our local businesses have made huge sacrifices. And it has saved lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August, we had 725 cases in Victoria, and today we had oneâone! The daily case numbers often shape the mood of our great city, and on days of high numbers we have been flat. But today the mood is one of pride. Across the world, lockdowns are being imposed as the virus continues to gain momentum. Case numbers are exploding in the UK, in India, in Israel, in France, in Spain and, devastatingly so, in the United States. Yet, we have managed to get to the point where we are in Victoria because of the sacrifices and the collective approach made by Victorians. We have lost a lot of livesâfar too manyâbut nowhere near as many as we would have had we not stayed the course, nowhere near as many as we would have had we just done what other countries did and let the virus rip, and nowhere near as many as we would have had we just listened to the federal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the pandemic first hit our shores, Australian people looked for unity. The Prime Minister fronted the nation and promised unity in the national cabinet, and people were relieved. I was relieved. It meant that we were going to pause partisanship for the sake of our national interest. But, as of today, something significant has changed since April. Today we have a federal government more interested in playing politics than they are in providing the supportive leadership we desperately need during this pandemic. In a time where we need giants, our Prime Minister presents as a small-minded, hyperpartisan combatant more interested in commenting from the sidelines than actually taking political risks and sharing responsibility. He demands that the states follow his orders: throw your borders open and don't listen to your health experts. But, if anything goes wrongâwarning!âthis Prime Minister will throw the states under the bus, especially if they elected a Labor premier. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our federally regulated and funded aged-care facility system was woefully unprepared for an outbreak, with no plan to deal with one. That couldn't be the federal government's responsibility or fault. No, that's Victoria's fault, apparently. There's the inability of Australians to return home. Well, surely, that's got to be the state's fault, because even quarantine, a federal responsibility in the Constitution, has been palmed off to the states by this Prime Minister. Then there is contact tracing, a difficult job made even more difficult by the fact that the Prime Minister's faulty app didn't work in the state where we desperately needed it to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister hasn't been there to support Victorians in our time of need. In fact, the Prime Minister cut support to Victorians in our time of need. He cut support to JobKeeper. He cut support to JobSeeker. The Prime Minister chose the leave so many off JobKeeper support in the first placeâartists, casual workers, those in the university sector and in local government. And, all the while he's cutting support, he sends out his lackeys to go and attack Labor premiers. He sends out his lackey, the Minister for Home Affairs, to attack the Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. He sends his lackeys, the Treasurer and the health minister, to go and fight and undermine Daniel Andrews. And he sends his lackey, Clive Palmer, to go and undermine Mark McGowan and to fight him in the courts in WA. This Prime Minister is happy to expend lots of energy fighting the Labor Party but not much energy bringing the member for Hughes into line for his dangerous contradictions of the chief medical officers in his own government during a health pandemic. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I want to start with acknowledging the people from my community of Curtin for the way they have responded to the pandemic. Right from the very first days of the pandemic, we came together in a volunteer network to assist others. I also thank them for their honesty and candour in approaching me about the many and varied issues that people were facing, whether it be waiting times in the early days with Services Australia or whether it be access to other services. They were all very open and brought their issues to light. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing this particular MPI topic today, the starting point is: what is the role of government? The role of government is, ultimately, to ensure the safety and security of the nation and its peoples; to preserve and protect their health and wellbeing; to create the settings for people to have the opportunity to fulfil their potential and to live their best lives; and to ensure that those who can't provide for themselves are supported to live in dignity. So if we ask what issues matter during COVID-19âbecause it's times like these when we really do expect governments to step upâwhat have people been concerned about this year? People have been concerned about their health and the health of their loved ones. People have been concerned about their financial security now and in the future. People have been concerned about the financial security and stability of the country both now and in the future. And this government has been responding to each of those in turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a very unusual experience right back at the beginning of the pandemic, when everything was shut down in Western Australia. I hopped into a COVID-appropriate queue, waiting to get a coffee. As I was in that queue, a man came up to me and shirtfronted me. This was way back in March. He started pointing at me, saying, 'Your government is doing the exact wrong thing. You are going to have suicides on your hands. You're going to be responsible for people killing themselves. You're going to be responsible for people losing their jobs.' He went on and on for a couple of minutes, until a couple of people within the cafe came to rescue me. I reflected at the time on his point and I thought, 'No, we are doing the right thing. We don't know enough about this virus. We need to take all steps.' We know a lot more about the virus, but we still need to take steps. My point there is that the issues that he was raising about the mental health impact of this virus have to be taken into account, and they are being taken into account by this government in the steps it's taking to address that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to commend both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, and the health minister, for always being aware that, in addressing this COVID-19 pandemic, we've got to look at it on multiple fronts and we've got to look at it both in the here and now and in the future. We have to look at the economics of it right here and nowâsupporting people, encouraging job growth, encouraging businesses to spend money, helping people who have lost their jobsâbut we also have to think about the future economy. We need to make sure that we actually have a viable economy for our younger people, for my childrenâand their children, for heaven's sake, if they ever have anyâto grow up in. So we need to be taking actions and making decisions for the here and now and for the future. Likewise, yes, we have to do that in health, and we've invested enormously in addressing the health concerns here and now. The number of listings on the MBS has been increased exponentially. The amount of money put into telehealth and various other services has all been for the here and now. But we are also investing in health for the longer termâin health research and, importantly, in mental health initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that previous speakers in this debate have taken the time to criticise and judge comments made by the Treasurer and actions taken by the Prime Minister. Earlier, when the Treasurer and I were talking about the mental health impacts of coronavirus, he shared with me a text message that he received yesterday, and it says this: 'Well said today, Joshâtotal "bloody-mindedness". No other way of putting it. We have friends whose kids are self-harming, and one friend's husband committed suicide last week due to losing his job. This is what is happening to us as a community. Please keep fighting for every Victorian.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no manual for addressing a pandemic. As I said, our government has been doing what it was required to do: balance competing factors and think about both the here and now and the long term for everybody. That's what governments as stewards of the country must do for the people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  [by video link] It needs to be acknowledged in this place how difficult this time has been for those of us here in Melbourne. People have lost their jobs, businesses are struggling and we are collectively feeling the strain of our long lockdown. It's been said by others, but it really is true: you can't understand what this has been like if you haven't lived it. But we have collectively smashed the second wave, and that is down to the work of our community. Individually and collectively, Melburnians have obeyed the rules. They haven't agreed with all of them, and many in my community have told me when they disagreed, and I understand and I respect their views. But, because of their efforts, we are facing a much brighter next few months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the peak of this second wave, in August, Victoria reported 725 daily COVID cases. Today, I am so relieved to say, we reported just one new caseâjust one! That is a massive turnaround. The comparison has to be made: at the same time as daily cases in Victoria peaked at 725, the UK recorded similar numbers, at 891. As I just said, today in Victoria we have one new case. Yesterday in the UK they recorded almost 19,000, and they, and many other countries in Europe, are now facing renewed restrictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorians have managed this incredible improvement through their individual and communal efforts and despite the politicking from the Morrison government. Victorians have been led by a state government that has made the difficult decisions. That doesn't mean there haven't been mistakes; of course there have been. But leadership in a time of crisis means taking responsibility. It means stepping up and, where necessary, taking the hard decisions. Clearly, the Prime Minister and his Victorian cabinet ministers think it means something else entirely. If you are a Victorian, all you've seen from this Prime Minister and his cabinet is government by press release, by announcement with no follow-through, by sniping drops provided to friendly media outlets. The man elected to lead our country thinks that is the best he can do for us in a time of crisis. Well, how incredibly disappointingâalthough what else can we expect from a man who 'doesn't hold a hose, mate'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that the Prime Minister and his government have reduced the rate of JobKeeper and JobSeeker despite the strong need in our community here. Even before they reduced the rate, they'd left out too many peopleâlike the New Zealand-born chef at one of my local RSLs, who's now worried about how he supports his family, or people who worked at our local university, La Trobe, where the government deliberately designed the JobKeeper scheme to exclude them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that when childcare centres had to shut in Victoria this government thought it was appropriate to cut the early educators in those centres off JobKeeper entirely. I can't tell you how many distraught workersâand in fact centre operators, who knew they weren't able to do the right thing by their employeesâI talked to about that decision. Did I get any movement from this government? No. I wrote to the minister and he told me, 'It's all fine.' It's not fine. It hasn't been fine. People were looking to you to step up, and instead you stepped back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that this government left Australians stranded overseas in increasingly precarious positions without a comprehensive plan or a time line for getting them home. And this from the man who built his career on managing our borders! Suddenly he's no longer responsible for them and for how people come in through them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there is aged care, the government's biggest failure of all. I've talked about responsibility in a crisis. Nowhere has the failure to take responsibility been more evident than in aged care. We just heard from the member for Curtin how the role of government is to preserve wellbeing, to help people live in dignity. Well, I entirely agree. Where have you been, member for Curtin, during this aged-care crisis? Certainly we haven't seen the minister. We haven't seen the Prime Minister step up and take responsibility. I cannot tell you how distressing this has been in my community, how many families I've heard say they're scared about what's happening to their loved one in an aged-care facility. They haven't been able to get answers out of this government. I haven't been able to get answers on their behalf. There has been an abject failure of responsibility, an abject failure to focus on the things that matter during a time of crisis.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  This pandemic is a crisis that's affected every part of our country and, in some way, every person in our country. It is one of those events, like the Spanish flu, the Great Depression or the two world wars, that this generation of Australians will remember with dread for the rest of their lives. Today I particularly think about those incredible year 12 students who, with such great fortitude, have gone through one of the most difficult years of schooling and who started, in my state, their HSC today. I know that these are events they'll live with not just this year but for several years to come, events they'll talk about for the rest of their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a credit to all Australians, including in my own community, that as a nation, despite the impacts that so many in our community have faced, we have done better than most other countries in the world. We've done better because governments have come together, communities have come together, our health workers have come together and our researchers have come together. In fact, all Australians have united behind the common cause of trying to defeat the effects of this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore extraordinary that the opposition come into this parliament today and question the priorities of the federal government during the last six months. I wonder which one of those priorities they think we've got wrong. Has it been the support we've provided to our health system, which has been so vital to protecting lives? Is it the priority we gave to cushioning the economic blow of this pandemic, which we have done through all of the actions that we have taken as a government over the last six months? Or is it the priority we are giving to rebuilding and recovering, providing hope to those people who've lost their jobs? Are they the priorities those opposite are questioning today? Those three priorities, more than anything else, have been squarely at the heart of everything the federal team, led by our Prime Minister, who's worked day and night to help Australians, has been doing over the last six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can only ask why the opposition would raise an MPI like this. But it's not a surprise, really. One of the great lies of the last six months that we've seen emanate from the other side is that the opposition wanted to be a constructive part of the team which has been trying to protect Australia from the pandemic. Whilst they talk about being constructive, we know that every single action the opposition have taken over the last six months has been nothing short of carping criticism, which has not helped but in fact harmed and, in many cases, instilled fear in Australians. We can only wonder why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect that, in some ways, it's because the Leader of the Opposition is still in a fit of pique because he wasn't part of the national cabinet, which brought together heads of government. Funnily enough, you actually have to be a head of government to be part of a national cabinet of heads of government. That fact doesn't seem to have struck him. But it is interesting to think about what the Leader of the Opposition's contribution would have been if he'd been a member of the national cabinet. We've had some indication of what that might have been like, because we saw some of his priorities in the early days. I remember so vividly the great brainwave we had from the Leader of the Opposition in June, no doubt determined to achieve immortality. He said that a priority for the Australian government, in the middle of a national pandemic and economic crisis, should beâwait for itâthe creation of a national drivers licence. No doubt he was hoping that, like the go card, the myki, the Opal or the SmartRider, this would be a national drivers licence that had a name. No doubt he was hoping it would be called 'the Albo' so that, for ever and a day, every Australian, when they weren't worried about having Labor's hands in their pockets and in their wallets, would know that there'd be an Albo in their wallets and purses. That's the type of contribution that we have seen over the last six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on what our priorities actually have been. We've been protecting the health of Australians, putting $16 billion into research and making sure we have options for a vaccine. There's the work we've done to secure PPE supplies for our health workers, the agreements with the states to make sure that our hospital systems could hope, and the advice of the experts, which has been guiding us through this. These have all been hallmarks of our successful management of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the health crisis, we've obviously been addressing the economic crisis. The federal government have done that in every action we've taken. There are 3Â½ million workers that have survived this because of JobKeeper. There's the support to businesses and there's the budget, handed down at the beginning of the month, which is all about the rebuilding process. These are the priorities of this government. They're priorities that are respected and admired by the Australian population, and for good reason. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Well, the facts, when it comes to being prepared for COVID-19, need to be put to this parliament. It has not only cost Australians more money than they've obtained; it's wasted their time. We've seen a lack of resources available and we've seen cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker when we can least afford changes to the unemployment benefit. Coronavirus has been a time for leaders to come forward, bring good policy, support our community and protect our economy. Instead, just the week before last, we saw a budget that leaves thousands of Australians behind and heading into poverty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was badly unprepared for a pandemic. In its seven years in office, this government hadn't run a single pandemic preparedness drill. It had run our national medical stockpile down to dangerous levels, with less than one mask for every Australian, and with no gloves, gowns or goggles in some cases. We then saw 28 deaths linked to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, when the Commonwealth is responsible for our borders and the Prime Minister had promised 'bespoke arrangements for cruise ships'. As of yesterday we have seen 683 deaths in residential aged care, a sector the Commonwealth funds and regulates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight and compare this to my home state, where we've seen outstanding leadership when dealing with the COVID crisis by our Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. In Queensland there have been zero new cases today and there are four active cases, 1,164 cases in total and 1.1 million tested. Quite frankly, Queensland has led the way in this country. Yet somehow, in the middle of this chaos, when the states of Victoria and New South Wales were still getting on top of this virus, we had this LNP federal government working hand in glove with the LNP state opposition leader in Queensland, Deb Frecklington. She, aided and abetted by her federal colleagues, called for our borders to be open 64 times when we could least afford that and it would have had a catastrophic effect in Queensland. We saw member after member here and senator after senator in the other place, demanding that our borders open. The Prime Minister called for the Queensland borders to be opened numerous timesâalong with the Minister for Home Affairs, himself a COVID spreader in my home state, who said that the Queensland Premier had 'no consistency, no compassion and no common sense'. He called her 'pig-headed'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that in my home state the Premier is regarded as an outstanding leader, someone who has saved Queensland through strong action on health defence. All the state Queensland LNP members put up all the quotes on opening the borders and then they quietly took them off their Facebook pages. We know what's happened. We're not going to talk about borders anymore. No-one's talking about opening the borders. They've all gone quiet. They've all gone back to their electorates and heard the message loud and clear. The member for Fisher and the member for Fairfax were in this place, jumping to their feet, demanding that the borders be opened. Now there is silence because they realise what an outstanding job our Premier has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 11 days the people of Queensland will decide between a strong leader who has a plan and the LNP opposition leader, who is frankly a risk to our borders and a risk to our economy. We know it is in the LNP DNA to cut, sack and sell. They do that at a Commonwealth level and they have a proud record of doing that in our home state. The last time the LNP were in government in Queensland, we saw 4,400 health staff in Queensland sacked. We saw maternity services cut and we saw midwives sacked. We know that, in the five years since the Palaszczuk government was elected, we've seen the hiring of 7,358 more nurses, 2,450 more doctors, 2,031 more health practitioners and 812 more paramedics. So we know that, when there is a pandemic, Queensland is well equipped, fit for the purpose of dealing with a health crisis, and now the Queensland government is rebuilding. If only this federal government would take a leaf out of the Queensland government's book; if only this government would actually look at what strong leadership is all aboutânot cutting, not sacking and not selling our essential services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I welcome this opportunity to talk about the issues that matter during COVID-19 and I welcome this matter of public importance. I've been a little surprised by the interventions of those opposite, who have seemed to want to talk about a lot of issues that don't matter, such as the relative performance of the Queensland Labor government, and whether the Daniel Andrews government should or should not be subject to legitimate scrutiny and criticism for their own failures during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. But I was reminded of the words of the Leader of the Opposition last week in his budget reply speech. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Amid all the chaos and hardship that has shaken our world in 2020âthere is nowhere else you'd rather be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think those are very true words. Amid all the chaos and hardship that has shaken our world in 2020, there is nowhere else, other than Australia, you'd rather be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First and foremost, the duty of any Australian government is to keep its citizens safe and protect them from harm. Undoubtedly, the biggest threat to Australia this year, the biggest threat to the world this year, has been the COVID-19 pandemic. It has threatened the lives and the livelihoods of people all around the world. In terms of its impact on health, there have been upwards of 30 million cases worldwide, with upwards of one million lives lost, and no-one has been immune from it. We've seen world leaders, from the President of Brazil to the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the US, struck with COVID-19. In this year alone COVID-19 has killed more people than malaria has, more people than HIV/AIDS has and more people than suicide has, so anyone who downplays the lethality and seriousness of this disease is not only wrong but dangerous. They are encouraging complacency where none is warranted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic shock of COVID-19 has been equally profound. It has been the biggest economic shock to the globe since the Second World War. The IMF expects the global economy to contract by 4.5 per cent through this year. That is compared to a contraction of 0.1 per cent during the GFC, so we're talking about a shock that is 45 times bigger than the global financial crisis. The IMF expects economies to contractâthe US by around four to five per cent, Japan by five per cent, the European Union by about eight per cent, the UK by 10 per cent and New Zealand by 13 per cent. In fact, the only major economy that is likely to grow through 2020 is China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has not escaped unscathed. We've had 905 deaths hereâevery one of them a tragedy in their own right. We've had 27,400 cases. Our economy contracted by seven per cent in the second quarter. Many jobs have been lost. Many businesses have suffered or been forced to close. And there has been a lot of mental hardship caused by the social isolation and dislocation it has ensured. But the damage done to Australia has been much less than in other parts of the world because of the laserlike focus that we have brought on the issues that matter during this complicated and unprecedented pandemic: protecting the health of Australians, cushioning the blow to the economy and preparing our economy for recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have protected the health of Australians. The death rate in Australia is around 33 per million. In France it's 14 times that. In the United States it's 17 times that. In the United Kingdom it's 18 times that. In Spain it's 19 times that. Our early border restrictions helped us stop the entry of the virus. Our testing regime, having done over 7.7 million tests, is one of the best in the world. We invested heavily and early in things like ICU capacity, ventilators, personal protective equipment, telehealth testing and contact tracing regimes. In total we've had a health response of more than $16.5 billion. Here, in particular, we should pay tribute to all those health workers and frontline workers in critical services, who've been so integral to the effectiveness of this response in Australia. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span> published in research just a few weeks ago, more than 16,000 people would have died in Australia if our outbreak was as widespread as that in the UKâmore than 16,000 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also cushioned the economic blow of this virus. Of the over 1.3 million people who lost their jobs or had their hours reduced during the crisis, over half are now back at work. Programs such as JobKeeper have helped over 3Â½ million Australians, whilst other measures such as JobSeeker, early access to superannuation, coronavirus supplements and pension supplements have helped households. Treasury estimates that unemployment would have reached 12 per cent without government intervention. Instead, it is now expected to peak at eight per cent in the December quarter. There is a long way to go, but we have been able to do all this because we had repaired the budget and could proceed from a position of fiscal strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also building the economic future. The budget contained the important $1.9 billion investment package in future technologies around clean energy and the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy. The government has focused relentlessly on the issues that matter during this pandemic, and that has shown in the results.</span>
              </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  As I was saying earlier, the government is allowing 11 million Australians to keep more of what they earn, through new tax cuts brought forward into this year. This is going to support consumer spending for 89,600 people in the electorate of Fisher, keeping money flowing in the economy, keeping the region's businesses open and keeping locals employed. In 2021 these low- and middle-income earners in Fisher will receive tax relief of up to $2,745 for singles and up to $5,490 for dual-income families, compared with the 2017-18 settings. The majority of the benefit for 2020-21 will go to those on the Sunshine Coast with incomes below $90,000. Treasury estimates that letting working Australians keep more of their own money through this measure will boost GDP by around $3Â½ billion this financial year and $9 billion next year. This measure alone will help to create an additional 50,000 jobs by the end of 2021-22.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, alongside consumer spending we need to see strong businesses on the Sunshine Coast which are incentivised to invest and grow their workforce. There are of course already many businesses on the Sunshine Coast whose fundamentals are sound and who would in normal circumstances be ready and able to drive our economic recovery. However, many of them are currently struggling with losses which, through no fault of their own, could restrict their ability to take advantage of improving circumstances to drive new job creation on the coast. The 2020 federal budget allows companies with a turnover of up to $5 billion to offset tax losses against previous profits, on which they've already paid tax, to generate a refund. Losses incurred last financial year, this year and next year can be carried back against profits made in or after 2018-19. Eligible companies can get a tax refund when they lodge their tax returns for this year. By getting a cash refund against their losses earlier, this measure will allow hardworking business owners on the Sunshine Coast to reset, keep their businesses running, retain their workers and invest with confidence in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also provides record incentives to make it easier for Sunshine Coast businesses to make investments and offer new or improved products and services. Growing businesses with new products and services to offer, of course, need more employees. Under the Morrison government's budget, from 6 October 2020 until 30 June 2022, as many as 30,000 businesses with a turnover of up to $5 billion in Fisher will be able to deduct the full cost of eligible assets of any value in the year they are first used or installed. Businesses right across my electorate are telling me that this is absolutely fantastic news. It includes improvements to existing assets made during this period. This will significantly reduce the cost of new equipment and new software, and businesses will be able to grow. Critically, it will encourage them to buy that equipment now, before the measure expires, at the time when the Sunshine Coast economy needs it most. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite have claimed this budget leaves the responsibility for economy-boosting investment like this solely with the private sector, but this could not be further from the truth. The budget includes a record $110 billion over the next 10 years to build new transport infrastructure, as well as a further $3.5 billion to build new water infrastructure. The 2020 federal budget's funding for new projects will support over 30,000 direct and indirect jobs, while in total our infrastructure package will support over 100,000 jobs across 10 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Fisher, this package included funding for $95.2 million committed for variations to the Bruce Highway upgrades currently underway between Caloundra Road and the Sunshine Motorway. This will ensure these upgrades are completed on time and in full. This project is already supporting 680 jobs on the Sunshine Coast. It's going to see locals able to move more quickly around our region and improve the experience for tourists, which will boost our local economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget invested an extra $1 billion for the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, including more than $11 million in Fisher. This is in addition to the existing $3.6 million allocated to our council in the last round. This will deliver money to the Sunshine Coast Council to spend on smaller civil construction projects for local infrastructure at a community level. I've already been in touch with the Sunshine Coast mayor to highlight some of the projects which I believe should be local priorities for this funding in our community. I'm hoping to meet with the mayor soon to discuss with him the possibility of investing this money in upgrades to the Mooloolaba foreshore and pathways at Bokarina Beach, as well as the opportunities provided by new rounds funded in this budget of the Building Better Regions Fund, the Stronger Communities Program, the volunteers grants program and the Safer Communities Fund. Before I move on, let us not forget that all of this is on top of the more than $3 billion the coalition government are already investing in upgrades to the Bruce Highway between the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane, and the $390 million we're contributing to the duplication of the North Coast Line railway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the government's extensive support, we know that this COVID recession has been particularly hard on young people in my electorate. We need to get young people back to work as soon as possible. One of the budget's most important measures will make it much easier over the coming 12 months to give young Australians a start in the workplace. The government's $4Â½ billion JobMaker hiring credit will help to create 450,000 new jobs, including in the critical Sunshine Coast tourism and construction sectors. Almost all Sunshine Coast employers will be able to claim $200 a week for each additional eligible employee they hire aged 16- to 29-years-old and $100 a week for each additional eligible employee aged 30- to 35-years-old for 12 months. As long as the job is in addition to a business's existing payroll and the individual employed was previously on JobSeeker, then it is very likely that the role will be supported with up to $10,400 from the government. I expect this measure to make a huge difference to the rate of youth unemployment in my electorate, and to give Sunshine Coast locals very soon the start that they need in a fulfilling career. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those young people on the coast still needing extra training to enter the world of work, the budget is delivering for them too. As part of our COVID response, the government invested $1Â½ billion in expanding our supporting apprenticeships and trainees wage subsidy, paying 50 per cent of the wages of around 180,000 apprentices nationwide in small and medium-sized businesses. Last week's federal budget allocated a further $1.2 billion for an expanded scheme called the boosting apprenticeship commencements wage subsidy. This grows coverage of our 50 per cent wage subsidies to include 100,000 new apprentices taken on between now and the end of September 2021. There is no cap on the size of the company. The only requirement is that the apprentice not be already receiving any other type of government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who want to go to university instead, the budget provided an extra $550.3 million for an additional 12,000 university places and 50,000 short-course places to deal with the demand created by this recession. That is on top of the budget's record base funding of $19.8 billion for universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make sure that the jobs of the future are available in Fisher, the government is creating the $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy. This is going to help grow our manufacturing industry in six key areas where Australia is already strong: food and beverages, resources technology, medical products, recycling and clean energy, defence and the space industry. I believe the Sunshine Coast has a terrific opportunity to take advantage of this investment to help grow our industry base in defence, medical products and high-tech manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week's budget was a sensational budget for all Australians and great news for people on the Sunshine Coast. So many people on the Sunshine Coast have said to me that this was the best budget they have ever seenâand who could argue with that?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  [by video link] In my contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2020-21 and associated bills I want to speak about the failure of the government's budget to recognise and address the very serious social and economic problem of social housing and homelessness in Australia, a crisis of which we're yet to see the full extent because it's expected to get worse as the COVID-19 income protection measures and other rental support and eviction moratorium measures are scaled back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As more and more people are pushed to the edge of or into homelessness, there has never been a more urgent time for a federal government response. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Homelessness Monitor </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2020</span> found a significant gap between the number of homeless people seeking permanent housing and the availability of permanent housing. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation where homelessness will continue to be a problem in the long term, but this problem will be exacerbated further because of the decline in investment, especially by the Commonwealth, in social housing. The state governments are becoming very much aware of this looming crisis, with my own state of Victoria already indicating that the Victorian government will invest in social housing. The question at hand is: why didn't last week's federal budget respond to this crisis?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such is the gravity of the problem that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Homelessness Monitor</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2020</span> lead researcher, Professor Hal Pawson, is calling for a revival of the social housing program and saying that the Commonwealth must play a far more active role in tackling the problem. Professor Pawson clearly states that, although the contribution of the states is encouraging, the scale of the investment needed to seriously expand Australia's social housing stock is such that it can only happen with the Commonwealth government's commitment and leadership. Professor Pawson also made the point that last week's federal budget was indeed a wasted opportunity. With the current national shortfall of social housing being more than 433,000 properties, with over a million people losing their jobs and unable to afford their rent in the private rental market, a large number of Australians will be pushed into homelessness, thereby putting more pressure on the existing stock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has squibbed the opportunity to show leadership on this issue largely because it seems to believe, as the Prime Minister said today in question time, that it has already done the heavy lifting and it's now up to the states. Australia's homelessness and housing crisis is a complex, multifaceted, looming national crisis, and the Commonwealth has a lot more to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the Minister for Families and Social Services for her announcement in the weeks prior to the budget of some money at least to build affordable houses for women fleeing violence. Women and children affected by family violence are certainly one group of people who are increasingly affected by the crisis in affordable housing in this country, and any measure to support them is welcome. However, as I have said, the housing crisis is much broader than this, and a much more concerted effort by the federal government is needed. Data shows that women over the age of 55 are the fastest-growing demographic facing homelessness. Many of them are facing homelessness as a result of the death of their partner or divorce. These are women who gave up opportunities for a career or who did not participate in the workforce in order to raise families and to look after their household. They don't have superannuation. Alone and with their childrenâfor those that have themânow grown, they often find themselves destitute, struggling to make ends meet and, in many cases, homeless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two-thirds of primary social housing tenants are women on low incomes. It's extremely disappointing that the government has not seized the opportunity in this budget to seriously tackle the housing crisis and, in particular, to invest in social housing. I recently had the opportunity to speak via Zoomâas we all do these daysâwith members of the Northern and Western Homelessness Networks. This group represents 28 specialist homelessness and family violence organisations managing 100 homelessness programs operating in Melbourne's northern suburbs. One of the programs, Everybody's Home, conducted research in my local constituency and found that there are over 900 people experiencing homelessness in Calwell at this moment. The number is probably much higher, given that many people are sleeping on the couches and floors of friends. Not all of them contact housing services. They suffer in silence until everything in their life falls apart. Many are women from non-English backgrounds who are fearful and totally powerless to leave violent marriages, because they have nowhere to go. The lack of options in the private rental market and the intense shortage of public and social housing means a shortage of some 3,000 social housing properties in my electorate alone. As a result, the housing services in my electorate are forced to place people in motels just to get them out of sleeping in their cars or in parks for a few nights. It seems that these people will have very little chance of ever securing permanent housing because of the shortfall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern and Western Homelessness Networks research supports the anecdotal evidence my electorate office is approached about constantly. We've seen and continue to speak to people who are desperate for stable, safe and functional accommodation. We get calls on a regular basis from people who have been on emergency public housing waiting lists for years. Compounding the problem of a lack of affordable social housing is also the fact that Calwell has settled the lion's share of the refugee and humanitarian program. Almost all who have come from Iraq and Syria in recent times have settled in my electorate, where there is a growing community of people who seek to belong and to prosper. Affordable housing and a job are the two most important things that enable newly arrived migrants and refugees to begin their lives in Australia. Without either, they face the real risk of being unable to move forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public housing has been the great enabler of migrant settlement in this country. It's a no-brainer, then, that investment in affordable housing makes for a stronger community both socially and economically. A lack of housing goes hand in hand with major barriers to employment and with disruption to education for children and young people, compounding the stress of those with major physical and mental health problems. A lack of affordable housing impacts workforce participation and stifles economic growth and our health and wellbeing as a nation. If this doesn't make it a national priority, I don't know what does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this budget is really about 'jobs, jobs and more jobs', as this government has framed it to be, then why not prioritise and put some money into social housing as a national policy response to a social and economic crisis? For every dollar invested in building a house, you create $3 in the economy. If you put aside all the pertinent arguments about the need to tackle housing insecurity and homelessness, what about the importance of construction to the economy? Why wouldn't you adopt the Leader of the Opposition's plan to invest in social housing, both repairing and renovating existing stock and building new stock, to help our builders and tradies back into immediate and productive work? Every housing organisation in the country called on the government to put more money into social housing in this budget. Master Builders Australia, the Property Council and the Housing Industry Association all called for more government money for social housing. They called for it because it would mean keeping their members in work, and this 'jobs, jobs and more jobs' budget has let them down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget has also let the people in my electorate down. My electorate, as well as experiencing a shortage of social and affordable housing, has large numbers of residents who have lost their jobs or their small businesses, particularly in the construction industry. There are tradies of all varieties, support staff and small manufacturers on the construction supply chain who are desperate for work. We need to stimulate the sector to get them back into meaningful work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February this year, 1.2 million people were employed in the construction industry. As a result of COVID-19, the construction industry is forecast to decline by 13 per cent during 2020, compared to a six per cent drop in GDP more generally. Surely it makes sense to directly stimulate this sector by investing in a program such as the Community Housing Industry Association has proposed. The Social Housing Acceleration and Renovation Program aims to develop 30,000 additional social housing units through not-for-profit community organisations, but using private builders. Such a program has the potential to create up to 18,000 jobs, as well as much-needed social housing. These homes could be built in both metropolitan and regional areas, with the potential to boost local economies, increase social revitalisation and provide housing security for many Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building affordable houses in regional areas would go a long way towards addressing one of the significant impediments to encouraging people to move into regional Australia and take up jobs there. This would help revitalise regional Australia and simultaneously take pressure off urban areas and cities. This government has been particularly keen to revitalise and grow regional Australia and to address the demand for workers in the farming and tourism sectors. Success in encouraging Australians and new migrants to move out into the regions depends on the availability of jobs, but it also depends on affordable housing. With imagination and foresight in this critical policy area, an astute federal government should be showing leadership and leading the way in a coordinated national response, not looking away in the hope that the states will pick up the slack. Last week's budget failed to do this. Contrast this with Labor's budget in response, and the difference couldn't be clearer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a plan to address our social housing crisis, and it comes with a jobs plan. We can start with fast-tracking urgent repairs to existing social housing. Labor is calling on the Morrison government to create work for thousands of tradies in almost every suburb and town across Australia, including suburbs in the federal seat of Calwell, by investing half a billion dollars to fast-track urgent repairs to social housing. Twenty-five per cent of Australia's social housing needs repair and maintenance. That's some 100,000 homes. Some of these homes have problems such as mould, leaking roofs and water damage, while others are simply unfit for people to live in. People shouldn't have to wait for the Leader of the Opposition to draw attention to the disrepair and unlivable state of social housing before action is taken, though I'm sure that Nathan Anderson from South Australia was relieved that the Leader of the Opposition visited his mould-ridden apartment recently. Action has now been taken, and the family has been given a new home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much-needed repairs in social housing across the country could start immediately and could provide work for local plumbers, carpenters, electricians, plasterers and painters, as well as companies that manufacture building supplies and materials. This would also provide opportunities for apprentices. We're already hearing of tradies losing their jobsâ28,000 carpenters, 15,000 concreters and 9,000 electricians in the last year alone. They are fast becoming the middle-class poor, and many live in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of my electorate, I'm certain, will welcome Labor's plan to prioritise and address social housing and homelessness. Ahead of the next election, Labor will bring forward a comprehensive plan for the repair and construction of social housing. This will involve an immediate $500 million contribution from the Commonwealth and a partnership with the states with the expectation they will contribute up to the same amount in new funding. That is what a Commonwealth government doing heavy lifting looks like. I call on the government to act immediately to address the crisis in social housing and homelessness in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  [by video link] I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021 because it is so important. This has been the most difficult of years, and here in Melbourne we have done it harder than people in other states, with our community putting in the effort to see off the second wave. I know that people in my community are tired and anxious after that effort. At the same time, they want to know what comes next. They want to know that the federal government has a plan to support them and their recovery. They want to feel good about their children's future. Unfortunately, this budget does not deliver on that need. It leaves too many people out, particularly the people hardest hit by this recession, and it leaves too many people behind. It doesn't take up the opportunity to tackle climate change and put us on course to being a renewable superpower. And it certainly does not fix our broken aged-care system, which this pandemic has revealed to be too unsafe for and too uncaring of our oldest community members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the Morrison government's 2020-21 budget figures bring to an end three decades of economic growth, with a million people unemployed, with an expected 160,000 more by Christmas, and a trillion dollars worth of debtâdebt which had already doubled under this government and which is now four times that which the coalition inherited when it came to office. It doesn't have to be this way. As the Leader of the Opposition outlined in his budget reply, we can and should have a recovery that delivers a stronger, fairer and more secure future for all Australians. Scott Morrison's budget leaves people behind. It does nothing for the million Australians unemployed or for the people in my community who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in vastly different circumstances from what they expected at the start of the year. They still have mortgages to pay, kids to get to school and lives to get on with. But if they have lost their job this budget reduces their support back to $40 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in this pandemic the first people to be laid off and to be in positions of hardship were the people with insecure work, those with low wages and few entitlements. In many cases, these are the people with little to fall back on. Yet these are not the people being targeted for support in Scott Morrison's budget. Instead, the government has put in place a wage subsidy for young workers that actually risks discouraging employers from hiring older workers, in particular women over 35. We know these are the people suffering in this recession. We know it's harder for older workers to find employment during and coming out of a recession. It is inexplicable that, instead of recognising this, the government has put together an ill-conceived policy that will be a further disincentive for businesses to employ mature-age people. As the shadow Treasurer has rightly pointed out, never before has a government spent so much to achieve so little.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected to parliament last year, I've been fighting for Australia to have a childcare system that is more affordable and more accessible, providing local families with the support they need and children with the best start in life. I've had too many conversations in the playground with mums who tell me they just can't afford to go back to work for more than a couple of days a week because, after that, the cost of child care outstrips what they earn. Childcare fees in Australia are currently some of the highest in the world. During a recession where more women than men have lost jobs, it makes absolutely no sense that we would leave in place these high childcare fees as a barrier that stops women from being able to get back to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm so proud that the Leader of the Opposition announced in his budget reply that a future Labor government would cut childcare fees and help support women get back to work. We've got a plan for affordable child care that means 97 per cent of all families in the system will save between $600 and $2,900 a year. That is significant for so many families. No family will be worse off. Labor's policy has been welcomed by business, economists, business groups and the early learning sector, and, most importantly, it's been welcomed by families. That's because this childcare policy makes sense. It makes sense that we view child care as a universal service. It has benefits for all of us, instead of being an expensive privilege that locks too many women out of the workforce and denies too many children the best start in life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of support for child care in this budgetâand during this pandemicâreally highlights how the Morrison government just has not considered women in its budget. During this pandemic, despite women having to pick up the bulk of the child care and the bulk of the housework, and despite them losing employment at a greater rate than men, we do not see a focus on women and their needs in this budget. When called on this, what did the Prime Minister's office say? They said no-one credible thought that women had been left out of this budget. I assume they didn't plan to unleash the torrent of women on social media who called them out on thisâcredible women, all of themâfurious that, in the middle of a pandemic and a recession that have turned their lives upside down, this government couldn't find the support they needed and couldn't even comprehend that they needed targeted support in this budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this crucial turning point in our history, amongst all this destruction, it's incomprehensible that the Morrison government's budget does not chart a clean energy future for our country. We all know that Australia should be a renewable energy superpower. I hear this loud and clear from the people I represent. They want a clean energy future. When they talk to me about the future they want to create for their children and their grandchildren after this pandemic, this is the No. 1 issue they bring up. I can tell you that, for me, appearing via video link like this while seven months pregnant, in the middle of a pandemic, it is something I think about a lot. But, clearly, it is not something that the Morrison government is thinking aboutâbecause we risk missing our window for change. As the rest of the world transitions to a clean energy future, we risk Australian jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm proud that in his budget reply the Leader of the Opposition committed a future Labor government to modernising Australia's energy grid, allowing us to unlock our renewable energy potential. Australia's current energy grid is not fit for purpose. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it was designed for a time when solar panels ran pocket calculators, not the one in four households who have rooftop solar. The current network takes no account of the rise of renewables as the cheapest new energy source and it doesn't help link these new sources up to the national grid. So a Labor government will set up a new Rewiring the Nation Corporation to rebuild and modernise the grid, to drive down power prices and to give our economy a boost of up to $40 billion and create thousands of new jobs. The energy grid will be built by Australian workers using Australian suppliers, through mandating local supply and local labour. What a contrast with the Morrison government's budget. What a contrast with the Morrison government's refusal to deliver the modern energy network we need to unlock our renewable energy potential, and the investment we need to cut electricity prices and grow the jobs in our renewable energy sector and other areas. This government has had 22 energy policies in the last eight years, and all it has to show for them are high electricity prices and higher emissions. We must do so much better than this. My community is counting on us to do so much better than this when it comes to renewable energy and a clean energy future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we just heard from the member for Calwell, one of the big areas missed in this budget was social housing. We know that one of the things the government could do right now to create jobs and lift productivity is invest in social housing. There are 100,000 social housing dwellings around the country that are in urgent need of repair. Some of those are in my electorate of Jagajaga. They are crying out for federal government investment. We have too many people still waiting for a roof over their head. We have women in vulnerable situations trying to get away from family violence, long-term unemployed people who struggle without a roof over their head, families who are worried about where they'll bring up their kids. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a decent house is the foundation for a decent life. It allows for so much more to come together. It is a no-brainer that we should be investing in social housing at this time and yet, again, this is a missed opportunity by the Morrison government in this budget. There is not a mention of social housingânot the investment that could drive transformation in people's lives in my community and in other communities around the country. Again, what a contrast with Labor's plans. If we were in government right now, we'd be creating jobs for thousands of tradies in almost every suburb and town across Australia to fast-track urgent repairs to social housing. This could involve an immediate $500 million contribution from the Commonwealth and a partnership with the statesâhow about that, a partnership with the states instead of taking pot shots at themâwith the expectation that they would contribute up to the same amount in new funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that housing construction is expected to plummet this financial year, from 170,000 to as few as 125,000 new home builds. What an opportunity to invest in the future of our country. Investing in social housing would be a win-win. It would provide work for local tradies and it would fix the homes that need to be fixed. It would mean that so many more Australian families, including people in my community, had the possibility of waking up in a decent home, the possibility of feeding their kids without a leaking roof over their heads, the possibility of knowing that they had a more secure future for the coming years of their life. What a missed opportunity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area where we fail to see the government deliver in this budget is manufacturing. Through this pandemic, I've heard from people in my community about how disappointed they are about how little Australia manufactures now. We know that there's potential for us to do so much more here. We know that we could have an industry supported by federal government in this country. I have manufacturers in my community who have told me how difficult it's been for them since this government allowed the car industry to leaveâthat the work they used to have that flowed from that has gone. They're not getting the contracts they should in defence manufacturing because the government stitches it up for large providers. There was an opportunity here, an opportunity in all our communities, in communities like mine, for us to rebuild local manufacturing, creating jobs, creating know-how and creating innovation. But we need to see the investment and we need to see the follow-through from this government, and, unfortunately, it just was not contained in this budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for all the debt and deficit, for all the big talk in the announcements, what we're left with is a poorly targeted budget that doesn't support those people who need it most. It's left out women. It didn't have anything for child careâthe one thing that could really support women getting back into work. It's left out social housingâa huge need across our country. And it's left out the chance to transition us to a renewable energy future, to make sure that we are actually securing a better country for all of usâfor our children, for our grandchildren. It's missed this opportunity in this time of disruption to build a stronger, fairer and cleaner Australia. It's a missed opportunity. It's clear that Labor has a different plan. We've shown that we can step up, that we are ready to take the opportunity of this time and to deliver in these important areas. I think the contrast is clear. I think the Australian people will see that contrast is clear and will endorse Labor's policies for the future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  Yesterday I reflected on the important work of Services Australia in various communities and thanked in particular a lot of the public servants within Services Australia for the work they do. I also reflected on the fact that Services Australia has one of the biggest IT and digital budgets, outside of Defence, in the federal government. In particular, it is home to the Digital Transformation Agency. Under the ministerial arrangements, the minister for Services Australia is the minister for the Digital Transformation Agency as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of the DTA was supported by Labor. We saw the value in using technology to deliver better services to the public, so we've been a long-time supporter of it. But what's happening to the DTA is a tragedy. It has been slowly drained of its essence. It's been slowly drained of its vigour and its ability to deliver on what its charter was initiallyâeven in this budget, with what we've seen with the number of staff. During a pandemic, at a time of soaring unemployment, one thing the federal government could do, as I said last night, is take on more people, talented people, to give them a job and give them a start. There are so many people out there who have digital skills and could be brought on to help deliver government services better, and that could be done within the Digital Transformation Agency. What have we seen happen? We've seen the Digital Transformation Agency lose staff in this budget. In fact, the budget shows the average staffing level has fallen from 217 in the last financial year to 182 in 2020-21, despite the agency receiving a funding boostâso they've got more money!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Digital Transformation Agency was supposed to be home to the best and brightest tech talent within government to do the job needed to transform the way we deliver services using technology. It has not actually become home to talent; instead, it's becoming a honey pot for consultants. In the budget they cut the number of staff but increased the funding. Who is the winner? The winner is consultancy after consultancy. We have more DTA contracts for Boston Consulting Group and KPMG. Deloitte's contract with DTA has tripled, to nearly $30 million. Boston Consulting Group gets another $300,000 pay rise from DTA. DTA consultant costs have gone up five times in one year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not that I have a problem with consultants; some of my best friends are consultants. But the reality is that the DTA was not meant to be a clearing house for consulting payments. It was supposed to bring in talent to work on problems with the way government was delivering services, and come up with solutions. Now what we're seeing is consultant after consultant being brought in. I guess it's no surprise that the head of the DTA is a former consultant of Boston Consulting. Please don't think I'm suggesting there's anything wrong. What I am saying is that, if you have an ex-consultant in charge and your consultant payouts are increasing and the number of employees you've got is decreasing, it's a bit rich.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I find surprising is that they brought on consultants and paid nearly a million dollars to work out funding options. They brought consultants in to work out how DTA could get more money, which then eventually went to extra consultants. The only activity we're seeing is conceptualising what could be done to bring on more consultancy work and make existing consultants better, instead of bringing in people with talent to help the Public Service deliver its service to the public more efficiently. It's just wrong!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the problem with the government: they don't believe in the Public Service. They think the Public Service is something to be constrained rather than celebrated. In this great city of Canberra there are so many great public servants. We have criticisms of some of the higher-ups, but there are a lot of people in this town doing great things to help the people of this nation. At a time when a pandemic has ripped through employment in this country, putting people to work for the betterment of other people in this country is a noble ambitionâand a worthy ambition, at that. But this government is all about contracting out. It's all about bringing the consultants in. They're the only ones that seem to be doing well out of this. Instead of using technology in a way that would deliver meaningful results, meaningful benefits and concrete outcomes, they're just not doing it. It is an absolute disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have legislation like this that we're debating now. We'll talk about name changes and give effect to name changes. We don't need branding and marketing exercises. We need a serious effort, during a pandemic, to help the nation out, to help its economy, to build jobs, to build better services and to do it in a meaningful way, not just create a consultant carousel that enriches some of these big agencies at the expense of what we believe can actually truly be done to deliver better service to the public.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  [by video link] This bill is meant to be about how Services Australia, the government department that administers many of the services that so many people rely on, like Centrelink, could be improved. It comes from a government that, in the middle of a pandemic, has done nothing but attack the Public Service. I've had firsthand experience of this in my electorate. When the pandemic hit, it was as clear as day, certainly to us in the Greens, that it was going to result in high levels of unemployment. We knew that because the social-distancing restrictions that were imposed meant that large parts of the economy were going to grind to a halt. The government didn't seem to get that message. They came out with their usual trickle-down approach of giving huge amounts of money to business and hoping for the best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, what happened was that millions of people found themselves suddenly unemployed. That meantâand again it wouldn't take a genius to think this throughâhigh demand for Centrelink services. Nowhere was that being felt more than in Melbourne, and in Abbotsford, in the electorate of Melbourne, where one of the busiest metropolitan Centrelinks is located. So what did the government do? The same government that comes along here now and says, 'Pass the bill because it's going to improve it.' What did they do? They said, 'We are going to close it.' They came up with the flimsiest of excuses, saying that the tenancy was at an end and they couldn't find anywhere else. I'll tell you what, if you can't find a vacant office block in the middle of Melbourne in the middle of a pandemic, then you are not looking very hard, Minister. That excuse was so flimsy that everyone could see through it. People knew that not only could the Centrelink stay but it needed to stay. The cat was belled when the landlord came out and said, 'Oh no, we haven't actually evicted Centrelink. We want it to continue.' So all of a sudden the government was boxed into a corner. The community stood up strongly and said, 'We want our Centrelink to continue.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a particular kind of genius to close a Centrelink in the middle of one of the biggest pandemics in history, with images of Depression-era dole queues, as there were then, snaking around the corner in an area of high need like Melbourne. That's what the government did. The community said, 'No way, not on our watch,' and the government was forced into a backdown. Everyone was going to be told to go off to South Melbourne, to travel seven kilometres, at a time when everyone was being told to stay close to home. With five-kilometre limits and getting on public transport being discouraged, the minister said, 'Everyone should just get on a tram and travel seven kilometres to South Melbourne,' showing he had no understanding of the area of Melbourne or the needs of the people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That Centrelink is now going to stay. That decision was reversed by the minister under community pressure and we are going to keep our Centrelink in Abbotsford. That is a terrific thing and it's testament to the community standing up to a minister and saying, 'People need their services, especially in the middle of a pandemic.' But it comes not only as a bad and strange decision to make in the middle of a pandemic but also as part of a practice from this government when it comes to dealing with the Public Service and with Centrelink. The government has now embarked on a systematic practice of shutting Centrelink offices and telling everyone, 'You are no longer going to be able to have your problems resolved by coming in and talking to someone face to face.' The government has closed a number of high-demand Centrelink offices and sees the Public Service only as something to cut. That's doubly wrong in the middle of a recession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's wrong in the middle of a recession because so many more people will be relying on the services, as was the case in Melbourne and as has been the case around the country, but it's also wrong because the public sector should be key to the recovery. We are going to need a plan to get out of this recession that we're in, that gets unemployment down not to the six per cent that's the Treasurer's target but down to two per cent, which is where it was in the period between World War II and the 1970s. One of the ways that we can do that in the middle of a recession, when the private sector is suffering great uncertainty, is by growing the Public Service and investing in the services that people need. Our recovery plan needs to be not only green to deal with the climate crisis but also pink to deal with the number of women who have lost their jobs, quick to be able to be put in place right now and also safe. That's one of the things that the Public Service can deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So investing in the Public Service instead of cutting it, as this government is doing, is a key to economic recovery in and of itself, and we're going to need to do it, because the government is locking in six per cent unemployment in its budget forecasts. That means two million people in this country either without a job or without enough work, and the government thinks that's fine. The government is choosing six per cent unemployment. It could drive it down to two per cent if it wanted to, if it had the courage to do what governments did after World War II: invest. Use this period to ask the big corporations to pay their fair share of tax. Borrow, since money is the cheapest it's ever been, and use it to invest. At World War II, this country had its highest ever debt levelsâ120 per cent of GDPâand they brought it back down to normal within a decade or so because they used it to invest. But that's not what this government is doing. This government is saying, 'Instead of investing and bringing it back down to two per cent unemployment, we'll just factor in six per cent.' That's going to mean more demands on Centrelink and more pain for the Australian people. I make the point that the government is choosing to do this. The government could choose two per cent unemployment and could choose expanding the Public Service to get us back to full employment and to provide the services that people need, but instead it is choosing high unemployment and choosing cuts to Centrelink.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just cuts to the services. It ultimately results in the government spending just as much, if not more, money, because they contract out Centrelink services to consultants. That is part of the privatisation and neoliberal myth. The neoliberal myth tells us you cut back on government services and it is somehow better for the government. No, you end up spending the same amount of money, but you give it to the private sector. The problem with that is that, when it comes to essential public services that don't need to be run at a profit because they're being run for the public good, the private sector comes along and says, 'Yeah, we'll take some of that money, but we want to take some of it as profit.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Helping people get back to work should not be something that you make a profit out of. It certainly shouldn't be something that you become a millionaire doing. But that is what this government facilitates. The Greens have estimated that when you add up not only Centrelink but all those other areas of government services where the government helps big corporations make a massive profit off the back of public subsidies, we're talking about the equivalent of about $10 billion a year. That's $10 billion a year that should be going into jobs instead of going to profit, especially in the middle of a recession. It should be going into jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is that more needed than in Centrelink, because the demands are high and the number of staff should be increasing in the middle of a recession. It should not be an excuse for people in the job service or call centre industry to turn a quick buck out of people's misery. No, we should be investing in and expanding our public services at this time. That is why the Greens are pushing for a Senate inquiry into privatisation, into the last four decades of the failure of Labor and Liberal neoliberal policy, which has seen everything being privatised, deregulated and contracted out. It has failed the Australian people. It is time to unwind it. Name changes such as those being talked about in this bill aren't going to cut it. We need a mindset change. We need to say public services should be run for the public good and shouldn't be an excuse for big corporations to make a profit out of. I just want to make this point: I'm not talking about big corporations that have made their own way in the private sector; I'm talking about big corporations that make their money off the back of public subsidies. In the middle of a recession, with a million people still unemployedâand the government forecasting, banking on and being very happy with two million people either not having a job or not having enough work for the next couple of yearsâthat $10 billion should be going into jobs and services; it shouldn't be going into profits for big corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all comes at a time when the government say, 'We can find $99 billion in subsidies for big corporations and the very wealthy in this budget, and we can find money for tax cuts for millionaires,' which Liberal and Labor both vote for. They say they can find that, but they can't find enough money to lift JobSeeker. That's not only going to put stress on Centrelink staff, which we are talking about in this bill; with a million people still unemployed, and the prospects of unemployment remaining very high for a long time because the government is backing that in, we need to keep JobSeeker at $1,100. We cannot cut it. It should stay there. We need to keep people who haven't got a job at the moment, in the middle of a recession, out of poverty. We need to make sure people can live above the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's move to cut JobSeeker at a time when it is most needed will plunge thousands of Victorian families into poverty. An analysis of government data by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> estimates that about 420,000 people now living in Melbourne under lockdown are going to be impacted by those cuts. My community in Melbourne will be at the front-line of people impacted by these government cuts. The government brings a bill in here and says, 'Let's talk about improving Centrelink because it's about improving people's lives.' Well, one good way of improving people's lives is by not cutting JobSeeker when we are still in the middle of a lockdown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has heard from constituents who are at present only just managing to cover their rent and are extremely worried about the prospect of losing their house or going further into debt now that the coronavirus supplement has been slashed. My office has heard from young people who are currently employed but have been told their employment is likely to come to an end as the government winds back various supports and the social-distancing restrictions here remain. What's next for those people if they lose their job now, in the middle of a pandemic, when joblessness is high? After the recent changes they might have to wait up to 13 weeks before they can receive support from JobSeeker. If you've just lost your job in the middle of the pandemic, the governmentâas if nothing has changed in Victoria, as if, all of a sudden, all the jobs are available againâis now going to make people wait up to 13 weeks before they can receive support from JobSeeker. My office has also heard from a couple, both jobseekers, who have had to spend their savings just to make ends meet during the pandemic but may have their payments affected now that the assets tests are being reintroduced. That's one thing the government hasn't thought about. Some people, because of the uncertainty we are in at the moment, have done what they can to amass savings. And now the government is going to penalise them for that by reintroducing the assets test, so they will get even less money because they have taken steps to look after themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have moved a motion in the Senate to keep the coronavirus supplement at $550 a fortnight. We will introduce a bill into the Senate to make that happen, and we hope that it gets support. In the Senate, the Greens also tried to stop the reintroduction of that liquid assets waiting period and that assets test that is going to impact millions of Australians, but, unfortunately, it was blocked by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the government comes in here and says, 'We want to improve services to Australians,' forgive us for being sceptical. In the middle of a pandemic, you are cutting the level of social security payments to people. When we've got 12 people applying for every jobâand the figures in Victoria are worse than the national averageâand when so many businesses are struggling to get back on their feet, because the social-distancing restrictions that come from tackling the coronavirus remain in place and are likely to remain in place for some time, don't come in here with mealy-mouthed bills about name changes and suggestions for doing things that might help. Don't cut JobSeeker, keep JobKeeper going for as long as it's needed in Victoria and invest in public services that are going to grow jobs and meet the needs that people have. Let's build more public housing. Let's have free education. Let's have free child care. Let's do that instead of giving tax cuts to millionaires. That is the way that we're going to get to full employment and deliver some legacy for young people, who stand to be a lost generation if the government continues going down this path.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I'm glad for the opportunity to speak on this Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill and to support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Dobell. I would like to start by acknowledging the work done by the member for Maribyrnong. He's been a warrior for the rights and interests of vulnerable Australians for a long time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As others have observed, this bill itself is unobjectionable. It's always good to make administrative changes and changes to governance arrangements in the interests of making the system work better. Even mild improvements of that kind are welcome in such a critical area of government policy and support, because when we talk about the Department of Human Servicesâor Services Australia, as it has becomeâwe're talking about Australia's social safety net. It's there for all of us. Hardly any of us will go through our lives without at some point relying on its support. Our need for its buoyancy is always closer to us than we might think, and we've seen that in the course of the present crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about the programs and resources and, especially, the public servants, whose purpose is to support people in need. Yes, that includes people who are in trouble or people who are in crisis, but it actually covers a significant portion of our community: older Australians, single parents and their kids, people with disability. Reorganising a departmental structure, modernising terminology, clarifying reporting obligationsâthat's all good stuff, but it would be better if the government lifted its eyes, changed its course and perhaps changed its broader perception of our world by focusing on how to protect and enhance our social safety net and on how to enable, look after and lift the morale of those who are employed within the Public Service to assist people who have lost their jobs, to assist single parents and people who are unemployed or facing homelessness and to assist older Australians and carers and people with disability. Admittedly, that would be a pretty significant turnaround by the party of robodebt and pension freezes and Public Service cuts; from the party that instinctively and repeatedly divides Australia into 'lifters' and 'leaners'; from the party that instinctively and wrongly looks to weaken our budget capacity through tax cuts for already profitable big businesses, including foreign multinationals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there's nothing particularly wrong with this bill, there's definitely something wrong with the approach of the government in general. How much better would it be if the appetite for administrative tinkering that we see in this bill was only the prelude to a larger shift directed at making more substantial and desperately needed improvements? How much better would it be if the government took seriously its responsibility to ensure that our social safety net was the properly resourced and properly functioning foundation of a caring and egalitarian Australia? That should always be our objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've experienced over the last 12 months, starting with our first national-scale climate disaster in the form of the largest bushfires we've ever suffered and now, of course, in the form of a global pandemic, has displayed in even sharper relief the importance of our social safety net. Take JobSeeker alone. Over 27 days, from 25 March, 1.9 million intention-to-claim forms were lodged online. In the 55 days after the launch of JobKeeper, 1.3 million JobSeeker claims were processed. That's the volume that would normally be processed in 2Â½ years. In less than two months, the system accommodated a volume of claims that would normally stretch over 30 months. At the peak, more than 53,000 claims were completed in a single day. Many of the applicants had never accessed Centrelink support before in their lifetime, with one in eight new applicants needing to apply for a CRN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The torrent of urgent support work in those first months of the pandemic was stemmed by hardworking Centrelink staff whose morale and best interests are sustained in advance by the work of the mighty Community and Public Sector Union. Those Centrelink staff rose to what were enormous and extraordinary challenges, and they should be recognised and celebrated as some of our most essential workers, but they haven't been, and they don't receive the respect and support they deserve from this coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a phrase in the way the changes in this bill are described which I want to draw attention to, and that's the claim that these changes will be 'a more efficient and effective way of delivering government services'. Of course, that begs the question: what exactly is meant by 'efficient and effective'? I'm sure that at various times in the last few years, in the government's mind, robodebt would have been considered the epitome of efficient and effective: a brutal, dehumanised, badly calibrated and ultimately faulty, illegal, computerised trawl through the circumstances of hundreds of thousands of Australians. The government defended it and has continued to defend it. They have argued in defence of its effectiveness and its efficiency. It was a frightening en masse assault that wrongly and illegally attributed debt to hundreds of thousands of Australians, and yet the Attorney-General, around that time, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the moment those moneys have been refunded. There will be an argument as to whether or not we undertake to try and recoup any debts using other methodologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt he meant other efficient and effective methodologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In truth, even the basic order of that phrase is wrong. We should be focused on making sure that policies and programs are effective and then consider how they can work in good time and be delivered at fair cost. In the areas of health, education, welfare support and environmental protectionâall the key areas of Australia's shared wellbeingâthe starting point should always be the setting of high-quality standards of achievement. Set those standards and those outcomes as your lodestar and navigate towards them. That way the achievement of those standards becomes the definition of 'effective'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not hard to imagine the kinds of standards or tests that we need to apply in this area. Are people who need help getting support? Are people who are facing disadvantage receiving appropriate care and assistance? Are they being enabled to participate in the social and economic life of this country to the greatest degree, to be included, to be valued and to contribute to Australian society? Is the support sufficient? What will be the reality for people on JobSeeker when it reverts to $40 a day, which is apparently what the government intend?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months, I and all local members have heard stories that are at the same time both positive and desperately sadâfor example, single parents and pensioners who describe how the COVID-19 supplement has allowed them to purchase a heater or get their car fixed or afford a bike for their kid or pay for some dental work. It should never be the case that it takes a pandemic to lift support to a fair and reasonable level in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we focus on an effective social safety net we should ask some questions. Can people who need it get access to advice and assistance in a way that is timely, straightforward, courteous and responsive? Can they trust the system will be fair? Can they have confidence they won't be made to jump through ridiculous hoops that will be breached on a hair-trigger, pushing them into further crisis and often further financial trouble? Are the various parts of the social safety net properly linked up together? Does the income support and the employment service side of things and the question of housing and any issues related to disability support or specific veterans support work with as much harmony and coordination as possible? And are we valuing and supporting the public servants, the women and men who deliver on these standards, always recognising and valuing that it is their skills, their commitment and their emotional resilience, above all, that hold up our social safety net?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's by considering all these kinds of questions that the amendment moved by the member for Dobell and the work done by the member for Maribyrnong seek to help the government do a few things that are clearly needed and would make a substantial differenceâthings that would go a lot further and deliver a lot more than the technocratic bits and pieces contained in this bill. In truth, there isn't any great mystery about the broader issues that need to be addressed within the scope of the renamed Services Australia in order to help guarantee that it meets the needs of our community and is in keeping with our values and our ethos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the people who work within this vital part of our Public Service have been squeezed and neglected. We know that the outsourcing and privatisation of aspects of our social safety net have achieved what privatisation in this area of service always bringsânamely, a lower quality and more expensive service. We know that a system with arbitrary staffing caps and differential rates of pay and differential conditions for employees undertaking the same work through different arrangements is not only unfair; it is dysfunctional.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point out that in Western Australia, my home state, the impact of staff cuts has been extreme. In 2013, when this government was elected, there were 7,500 Department of Human Services staff in WA. Last year, the staff number was down to 6,500. That's a drop of 14 per centâ1,000 jobs; one in seven. Some of the cuts have been sharpest in rural and regional Western Australia. For example, in what's termed the Outback South regionâthe offices in Leonora, Kalgoorlie and Meekatharraâthere's been a loss of 215 staff. In Outback North, which covers Port Hedland, Broome and Derby, I understand they've lost 46 staff. When you make those cuts, you're not simply reducing services and support for a local community, for people in need and especially for those facing acute disadvantage; you're weakening local economies and the vibrancy of rural and regional towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of the many things that have gone wrongâthe many things that are being done badly by this governmentâsome of the solutions that should be under consideration are not really all that hard to arrive at. And this is precisely what the shadow minister has consistently pointed out. If you want to meet what should be the core responsibility of the Australian government and guarantee there's a high-standard and high-quality social safety net for all Australians as the foundation of our fair and egalitarian way of life, then you have to focus on what effective care and support actually means, and you need to make sure the people who deliver that care and support are valued. That's not what is happening at the moment. That's not the path this government has chosen. But it's not really that hard. Unfortunately for this government, what we have seen is a tendency to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze again; to make the lives of people who need help the most harder; to make the opportunities for people who already experience significant disadvantage fewer; to make efficiency, in the end, a euphemism for punching down, a euphemism for taking away from those who have the least and for failing to support those who need help the most.</span>

The amendments ensure references to Services Australia and the Department of Social Services are correct. To support service delivery, the bill makes governance changes to Services Australia. The CEO of Services Australia will perform the existing statutory roles of Chief Executive Centrelink, Chief Executive Medicare and Child Support Registrar. This change will sharpen the service delivery focus of Services Australia and ensure that the CEO is fully accountable for how administrative decision-making powers are delegated within the agency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't oppose these bills. In fact, in November last year I wrote to the minister asking him to consider making exactly these changes, to ensure that all students were subject to the same rights and protections, regardless of fee status. It's been almost a year since I wrote to the minister but, despite that, I welcome the legislation which will end the exclusion of domestic upfront-fee-paying students from the Tuition Protection Service. This will have a real and practical impact, creating simpler arrangements for students and making it easier for them to make decisions about their future study. It will also simplify student placement and loan recrediting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simplification of the rules and equalisation of status for students brings into stark relief just how complicated and unfair the government's other university policies are. Australian universities have suffered an absolute horror year at the hands of this government. Under siege, suffering relentless pressure, Australia's fourth largest export industry has scrambled for survival. This government has deliberately stood by as one of the sectors most critical to our economy has seen thousands of workers lose their jobs, regional campuses closed, whole university departments shut down and funding dwindle. Every week there is another one of these grim announcements:  another campus closure, another course ended, another round of job cuts. That's 12,000 jobs lost at last count. And I'm talking about the permanent jobs here; that doesn't take into account the sessional staff that haven't been rehired or the casuals who have fewer shifts or no shifts. It's 12,000 jobs lost so far, and it's estimated that another 10,000 will go in coming months. After a while, it seems like there is some sort of momentum to these job losses, as though they're somehow inevitable. They're coming like waves crashing onto a beach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad, infuriating truth is that this is not inevitable. This is a choice that the government has made to allow these jobs to go and to allow the university sector to be smashed by the funding that it's lost. Throwing our universities into the crisis they're facing now is a policy decision of the Morrison government. No other industry of this size has been treated with contempt in the way that the university sector has. No industry that employs 260,000 Australians has been thrown under a bus as gleefully as this sector has been. Universities are our fourth largest export earner. What are the first three? Coal, gas and iron ore. Imagine if we'd seen 12,000 job losses in one of these industries already. Quite rightly, the government would be there saying, 'What can we do to help?' Imagine if any of these other industries were facing this sort of devastation. But, as the government has been stepping in to help other industries, it has deliberately excluded higher education. You know it's deliberate, because they changed JobKeeper legislation three times to make sure universities were not eligible. Public universitiesâthat educate our workforce, that conduct life-saving research, that protect our history, that nourish our culture, that attract billions of dollars of export earningsâwere carved out of JobKeeper deliberately. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of this on regional universities will be devastating. Universities support 14,000 jobs in regional Australia. Take a couple of hundred jobs out of the Sydney CBD, and we feel it. I can tell you we can already feel it in my seat. You see the apartments that used to be rented by international students empty. You see the restaurants where the students used to eat; they're empty. We're feeling it in Sydney. But take a couple of hundred jobs out of a regional community and, oh my goodness, you feel it. We're talking about academics, tutors, admin staff, librarians, gardeners, cooks, maintenance crewsâall of them with families to support. They've had their government turn its back on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was so careful to make sure that Australian universities were excluded from JobKeeper, but they weren't so careful when it came to the private universities. The tiny local campus of New York University in Sydney, a private American college not even registered as a university here in Australia, was eligible for JobKeeper. Australian universities are not eligible, but universities from overseas with, I might say, large endowmentsâand good luck to themâwere eligible. How is it right?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you who was excluded from JobKeeper: workers at the University of New England in Armidale; 200 have already lost their jobs. Workers at Central Queensland University were excluded; 281 jobs have gone there and three campuses have closed. Yeppoon, Biloela and Sunshine Coast are all due to close their campuses. That is hundreds of jobs lost and campuses closing. How are these regional communities affected by the jobs that are gone and the students that won't get an education because those opposite have turned their backs on Australian universities? What about workers at the University of Newcastle, where 150 lost jobs were announced just recently? What about workers at Deakin University and their families? The member for Chisholm has stood by as 2,902 people have lost their jobs. That includes 386 continuing positions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the country, in every state, in every region, the story is the same. Those 12,000 job losses, with thousands more still to come, have been because this government has chosen to exclude universities from JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's so sad about this is that the Prime Minister hasn't tried to stop the job losses; he's actually been cheering them on. He's been cheering them on. The treatment of universities by this government only makes sense if you see it as part of its broader project to discredit and undermine higher education in this country. It's a project that came before COVID-19, but it's using COVID-19 as its cover now. Why else would the Prime Minister watch on as tens of thousands of Australians lose their jobs without making any effort to help them? Why else would the Prime Minister make no effort as he stands by and watches hundreds of jobs lost in regional towns like Armidale and Rockhampton? He would know how devastating these hundreds of job losses are in those regional communities. If he doesn't know, he should know. Why would he allow the reputation of these world-class institutions to crumble in front of prospective new students?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, to add insult to injury, the government has this so-called job-ready graduates legislation. Again, that cuts about $1 billion a year from our universities. Legislation just passed through this parliament makes it more expensive for people to get an education at a time when one in three young people are looking for a job or more hours of work. I cannot understand why this government would rather see young Australians in the dole queue than getting an education. This government is trying to price people out of the degrees that it doesn't like. It's this bizarre effort to engineer what students are interested in, what they're competent at, what they decide to study. It's so ironic, isn't it, coming from those opposite, who bang on about academic freedom? You don't have the academic freedom to study what you're interested in, the career that you want to pursue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has called our university researchers heroes during the COVID-19 crisis but is standing by watching as those researchers walk out of the lab door for the last time because they don't have the funding to continue their life-saving research. The government's talking about support for high-tech manufacturing and yet it's watching the institutions that drive that high-tech manufacturingâthe discovery, the innovationâbleed to death. The government talk about boosting advanced manufacturing by a billion and a half dollars while they're cutting a billion dollars a year from universities. And, of course, until very recently, they were doing their very best to cut $1.8 billion from research and development tax concessions as well. Those opposite have also taken this slapdash process to try and interfere with the sort of international collaboration that helped Australia discover the Gardasil vaccine and the sort of international collaboration that has helped Australia sequence the COVID-19 genome. At the same time as we are facing unprecedented challenges, those opposite are more than doubling the cost of a university degree for thousands of students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for a minute, I want to speak directly to year 11 and 12 students, particularly the year 12 studentsâthey have had the year from hell this year. They've had their education disrupted, they've had remote learning and they've been uncertain about their exams. I say to them: You have done so well. We are so proud of you. And, on this side, we are doing our very best to make sure you have choices next year and for the rest of your lifeâthe choice to go to TAFE, the choice to go to university, the choice to study something that will help you get the job of your dreams. That's what we're fighting for. And we'll keep fighting for you, and for your parents, too, because all your parents and your teachers and your carers and supporters want for you is that you have opportunities and choices in life. That's why we want you to have an affordable educationâso that you can have a real choice in your life. The last thing the government should be doing is making it harder and more expensive for you to go to university. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average, Australian students will end up paying seven per cent more for their university education. But, as I have said, some will pay more than double. Their fees will increase by up to 113 per cent, going up to $14Â½ thousand a year. I did a four-year degree. That would be $58,000. They will be taking on a $58,000 debt at a time when unemployment will be high for yearsâthe government's own figures show that it will be years until we're back at pre-COVID-level unemployment rates. They will be leaving university to go into, at best, an unpredictable labour market. They will be coming into adulthood at the same time that they're trying to save a deposit for a home of their own, maybe start a family, get married. I know what my parents would have said to me if I'd been a high-school student and said: 'Mum and Dad, I want to study communications and do an honours year. The good news is it's only going to cost $58,000.' They would have had palpitations. I would have been helping them off the floor if I'd gone home and said that. Working-class kids don't take on $58,000 worth of debt, with uncertain job prospects, to be repaid at a time when their families are saying to them, 'We want you to get a place of your own and start a family of your own,' and all the rest of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and we're telling these kids to take on a debt that will take decades to repay. We on this side will always oppose American sized university debts that take a lifetime to repay. When you look at the sorts of jobs created todayânine out of every 10 require either a university or a TAFE qualification. We say that young Australians should be able to choose what they study based on not what their parents can afford but on what drives themâthe work they want to do, the passion they have, what they're good at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a false dichotomy being set up by the government. They say, 'Labor is all for universities, but we're on the side of TAFE.' This is not a competition. We want strong and excellent universities and a strong and excellent TAFE system. Those opposite have cut both. They're trying to say, 'Don't look at the cuts to universities, because we're all about TAFE,' but they've cut both. We have 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees today than when the Liberals came to office. We have skills shortages. Before COVID-19, we had three-quarters of employers saying they couldn't find the skilled staff they needed; we were relying more heavily on temporary skilled migrants from overseas than at any other time in Australia's history. Right now, one in three young people are unemployed or wanting more hours. We've got shocking unemployment figures. More than a million people are unemployed, and, according to the government's own calculations, another 160,000 are due to be unemployed by Christmas. Why on God's earth are we making it harder and more expensive to get an education? It is honestly like those opposite would rather see people in the dole queue than getting an education. It's like those opposite think it's somehow wrong to aspire to go to university, that it's somehow elitist. It's like they think it's all about vague academics wandering around campus having Marxist culture wars, selling the <span style="font-style:italic;">International </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Socialist</span> newspaper and engaging in student politics, like the member for Mitchell did for so many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is actually wrong is not the aspiration to go to university. It was good enough for all those Liberal frontbenchers, and plenty of them have two or three degrees. Incidentally, plenty of them are humanities degrees, which they're trying to price other students out of. The education minister has threeâMr Three <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">A</span>rts Degrees himself! The government is desperate to make people embarrassed about aspiring to go to university. I think that is just so dishonest coming from a group of people who all had the opportunity themselves and who all took up that opportunity themselves, sometimes on multiple occasions, doing multiple degrees. What is wrong isn't aspiring to go to university or parents aspiring for their kids to go to university; that's not wrong. What is wrongâ100 per cent wrongâis being prepared to deny that opportunity to others when you've had that opportunity yourself. That's wrong, and that's what those opposite are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts made by those opposite, the refusal to help universities at this phenomenally difficult time and the changes to the cost of university education are of course unfair. They attack school leavers after they've had the year from hell, when they need support. But they're not only unfair; they're also illogical. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Education have said they want more students to study STEM subjects. That's the whole point of the legislation and the package as they have presented it. I don't know how they could have designed the package this way. They say they want more students studying STEM subjects, but the package actually reduces funding to universities for the teaching of those subjects. Soâhere I scratch my headâwe want more people studying these subjects, so we're going to cut the funding to universities for these places. Every extra student they take is actually going to cost them money. What will happen when universities receive 30 per cent lessâ32 per cent less, in factâto teach medical scientists, 17 per cent less to teach maths students, 16 per cent less to teach engineers, 10 per cent less to teach agricultural students, eight per cent less to teach nurses? We know what will happen. The tutes will get bigger; there'll be less face-to-face teaching; there will be fewer pracs and a degraded quality of education. The alternative is that universities will simply offer fewer places in these subject areas because they can't afford to keep teaching them. That's what will happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of the Grattan Institute, Danielle Wood, said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I honestly think it's one of the worst-designed policies that I have ever seen. Even if you accept its stated rationale, it doesn't go anywhere near achieving it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Prime Minister's being either dishonest about the rationale for the legislation or incompetent in designing the legislation, or he simply doesn't understand that you do not promote science and engineering by starving science and engineering departments at universities. You don't promote growth in manufacturing and infrastructure jobs by slashing the funding to train and teach engineers and others who will work in those sectors. You don't support critical medical research in the midst of a pandemic if your world-class researchers are lying awake at night wondering whether they'll have a job the next week or next month.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor were last in government we saw massive increases in the number of students going to university. An additional 200,000 students got the chance to go to university because we uncapped student places. We decided that, in an increasingly complex economy, one of the best investments we could make was in the education of our people. We saw 200,000 additional people get an education because we uncapped university places. We nearly doubled university funding, from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. Under Labor we saw huge numbers of Australians who were the first in their families ever to go to university finally get the chance. The number of students from poorer backgrounds went up by 55 per cent. Indigenous student numbers jumped by 89 per cent. Enrolments of students with a disability more than doubled, and enrolments of students from country areas grew by 48 per cent. These are the goals that have always driven Labor's policy. We want more people to get the chance to go to university. Our record over the decade speaks for itself. The suggestion that the government believes that the Job-ready Graduates Package, that has passed this parliament recently, will somehow make our university system more efficient and more effectiveânone of that stacks up. This is a disguise for a billion dollar cut to universities that comes on top of the billions of dollars lost because international students can't come to Australia at the moment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to the hundreds of thousands of workers, just over a quarter of a million workers, who work in the university sector; to our researchers, to our best and brightest working on the innovations and discoveries that will help us out of this recession; and to the young people and their parents who have had this shocker of a year, have got through year 12 in the toughest of circumstances and now face a government that's determined to make it harder for them to get a TAFE or university education, is: we share your disappointment. Labor shares your outrage. We will work every day in this parliament to stop, to reverse, the damage done by this government, the government that is damaging our once proud education system.</span>

                    <a href="80072" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of these bills: the Education Legislation Amendment (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection) Bill 2020 and the Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2020. I want to start by saying we are not talking about the job-ready graduates legislation. I also want to correct the record: universities were not excluded from JobKeeper. If universities satisfied the turnover tests at 30 per cent or 50 per cent they could qualify for JobSeeker. In one sense it's actually really good that they didn't qualify for JobSeeker, because that meant that they didn't suffer the 30 per cent or 50 per cent downturn. I accept that universities are doing it hard; a lot of Australia is doing it hard. But those tests of 30 per cent and 50 per cent were in place for all other businesses and all other organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the member for Sydney did point out that a small provider that isn't a university did manage to access JobKeeper. Yes, that's correct. It was a not-for-profit, charitable organisation that doesn't receive government funding. There is a distinction. They obviously satisfied the drop in turnover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to speak about these two bills because these two bills are about higher education, but they're not specifically about universities. These bills are designed to further strengthen the quality and integrity of our higher education system here in Australia, and to ensure that the diversity and choice which has been an increasing feature since of this system since the 1980s continues. Having a system where there is real choice for students, and choice that is not clouded by questions about quality, viability or reliability of the provider, is of utmost importance. Students need to know that if they start studying something they will be able to finish it. Students need to know that the money that they invest in their education is not lost if the provider ceases to exist midway through studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This sort of protection has been in place for quite some time for international students studying in Australia through the Tuition Protection Service. The Tuition Protection Service for international students is industry funded through an annual provider levy. It provides assurance and assistance to international students who may be affected by the closure of an education provider or course termination. The TPS helps international students either by placing them into a similar course with another institution or by providing a refund of tuition fees paid in advance for parts of the course that were not provided to the student. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TPS has played a very important role in ensuring the international recognition of the quality and safety of studying here in Australia, and that has been wonderful and it has made Australia an attractive destination for international students, but the situation for domestic students has always been a little bit different. Ninety per cent of higher education students in Australia study at table A universities, sometimes referred to as public universities. Now, it's been a long-time policy of governments of both varieties that, given the low risk of these institutions, no additional levels of protection are required for domestic students enrolled in them. But alongside the public university sector sits a vibrant and diverse range of registered and recognised private higher education providers, and close to 10 per cent of Australian higher education students study at these providers. These providers include two Australian universities, a university of specialisation, an overseas university and, as at June 2020, 135 non-university higher education providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the last time for which statistics are available, there were 127,000 full-time-equivalent students studying at these independent, private, non-university higher education providers. These providers educate students in a range of disciplines, including law, engineering, agricultural science, architecture, business, accounting, tourism and hospitality, education, health sciences, theology, creative arts, information technology and social sciences. And they teach across all AQF qualification levels, from diplomas through to doctorates. While they range in size, and some are very small, there are some that enrol over 10,000 full-time-equivalent students across multiple disciplines, and quite a broad variety of students, both domestic and international.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming majority of these providers are highly reputable, with solid financial underpinnings and with sound academic oversight. All of these are things that TEQSA regularly examines these organisations on. I would also add here that many of these non-university higher education providers excel on student satisfaction and student outcome measures. However, given that they're not underwritten by a government guarantee and given that there is always a danger of such an organisation or such a provider ending or collapsing, it has been a long-time policy position that these providers do need to have extra protection for students who enrol at them. These requirements, both tuition and financial safeguards, are included within the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) and are mandatory for non-table-A providers to register as higher education providers. Given the practical problems that providers had with the arrangements which were in place until last year, the government undertook to tidy up the system, ensuring that it works as it was supposed to for domestic students while simultaneously not putting an overtly costly and cumbersome obligation on these providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the government extended the TPS to cover domestic students receiving income contingent loans through the VET Student Loans program or the Higher Education Loan Program for students studying with independent education providers. This particular bill that we are discussing today will take that further. As of January next year, it will extend the tuition protection arrangements to apply to domestic students who pay their tuition fees upfront at a private, registered higher education provider under the TEQSA Act. This is intended to ensure that those students receive the same high-quality tuition protection as students who access FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for clarity, these protections are for the benefit of students, not providers. These arrangements offer support through a suitable replacement unit or suitable replacement course for students to continue their studies, or through a refund of the upfront payment for incomplete units of study if a provider fails to deliver them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should also be noted that this bill amends the TEQSA Act to provide for the requirement that a defaulting provider has initial responsibility to take action to provide a remedy to their affected students. Only when the defaulting provider is unable to provide a remedy to their affected students will the tuition protection director step in to assist in providing that assistance and assurance to the affected students. These amendments ensure that the tuition protection process is consistent for both affected HELP students and upfront-fee-paying students in the higher education sector. It provides certainty for those students who might consider studying other than at a table A university, and there are students who choose this. Ten per cent of higher education students enrolled in Australia are enrolled at non-table-A institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having this tuition and course assurance embedded in the system is an essential part of ensuring that there is real diversity in our higher education offerings and real choice. It is on this point that I actually want to highlight that both the government and the opposition have supported diversity and choice in our education offerings, both at school level and at higher education level, for decades. Despite rhetoric at various times, both parties have long recognised that the existence of both public educational offerings and private educational offerings sitting side by side is a significant benefit to the provision of education in this country and ultimately to our country as a whole. While playing a much smaller part in the higher education sector than occurs at school level, the private independent higher education providers make a vital contribution to the entirety of the sector, and so students who choose to attend to study at them should be protected. I note here that those students who do choose to study at them rate them very highly. So it is my pleasure to support this bill, given that it is helping to embed the diversity and choice in our higher education system which has become a hallmark, and long may it be so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Education Legislation Amendment (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection) Bill 2020 and the Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2020. These two bills expand the tuition protection scheme arrangements to include protection arrangements for domestic upfront-fee-paying students. Labor supported bills last year to expand the scheme to cover students accessing VET student loans, FEE-HELP and HECS-HELP assistance at private education providers. Labor was concerned when those bills were introduced that domestic upfront-fee-paying students were excluded from the scheme. The shadow minister for education and training wrote to the Minister for Education requesting that he consider expanding the system to all domestic fee-paying students. I am pleased that, although it took 10 months, the government finally tied up the loose ends in this scheme. These bills will see that domestic upfront-fee-paying students are included in the scheme and so Labor won't oppose these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will expand the scheme to give all students confidence they will not be left in debt and without a qualification if their training facility fails before they have finished their course. Sadly, both in my time as a politician and in a former job, I have seen that happen and how it wrecks young peoples' lives. Australia has seen it happen too often. Dodgy providers overloaded with students, merely for a quick profit, go belly up, leaving those students out of pocket and without the qualification they need to get a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome this tweak of the tuition protection scheme so that all students are covered, I am still concerned about this government's treatment of the university sector more generally. Unfortunately, the Morrison government has done nothing but attack the higher education system in Australia. I don't know what happened to the Prime Minister when he was at university, but it must have been a traumatic experienceâwhether he was rejected by his peers, attacked by a tutor or snubbed by a professor. I am not sure what happened, but he really needs to go and see a therapist rather than roll out his rage on the universities of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's as if those opposite fundamentally don't care about or don't understand higher education. I know that there are members there that have a strong history of being involved in universities, but, sadly, we've got some people in charge of portfolios who must be losing battles in the cabinet room. Some of the decisions that they're making are reckless and short-sighted. They say they care about jobs, but universities support an enormous range of jobs, not just academics and tutors, but the admin staff, the library staff, the catering staff, the ground staff, the cleaners and the security staff. These jobs have been disappearing under this government. What have we seen? More than 12,000 jobs lost across the country already and, sadly, thousands more are predicted to go before the end of the year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, it will have ramifications for regional areas as we come up to Christmas. The Morrison government went out of their way to exclude public universities from JobKeeper. They changed the rules three times to ensure that our public universities didn't qualify. This government could have stopped the job losses but they deliberately chose not to. They chose not to in a sector that is Australia's fourth largest export industry. It is the regional universities, as I said, that are going to be hit the hardestâuniversities that support 14,000 jobs in regional Australia, in places like the Sunshine Coast. And this is at a time when we are relying on universities to support our brilliant researchers who are working on a vaccine for COVID-19, yet the government are doing this. Could this luddite government's priorities be any more skewed? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recovering from this pernicious Morrison recession will take vision and it will take planning, neither of which has been evident in this government. We know that by 2025 Australia will require an additional 3.8 million university qualifications. We need our universities to be skilling up students for the jobs of the future. They need support, not constant cuts. The Morrison government's job-ready graduates legislation cuts funds from universities and makes it harder and more expensive to go to university. Basically, overall, Australian universities will receive less funding to teach students. Imagine that: in 2020, being a government that will provide less funding to universities to teach students. The university sector faces a funding cut of around $1 billion a year. That cut is on top of the $16 billion projected revenue drop from international students being locked out and the $2.2 billion in cuts already made to university funding by the Liberal and National Party government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This coalition government is nothing if not consistent in its betrayal of higher education, making short-term political decisions that are betraying our nation's future. Not only are universities like Griffith University in Moreton or the universities that I attended such as QUT and the University of Queensland being attacked but students will individually be paying more for their degreesâon average, seven per cent more. Forty per cent of students will be paying more than double for the same qualification before the Morrison government touched the process. Fees will be increasing to $14,500 per year, and we're not talking about medical degrees here. The degrees that will double in cost are degrees in the humanities, commerce and communications. These are degrees that this government thinks produce graduates that are less employable. But there is no evidence that this is true. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pretty sure there are a few graduates of those disciplines occupying the government benches in this parliament. In fact, the job prospects of humanities graduates are very healthy. Recent research suggests that people with humanities degrees have higher employment rates than science or maths graduates. So this Morrison government is cutting billions from the university sector, while doing nothing to help young people get into the high-priority courses and jobs. The Morrison government wants to encourage enrolment in maths, science and engineeringâand I say up-front that these are noble and strategic aimsâbut what the government's legislation actually does is reduce the money that universities will receive to provide those courses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, there will be a disincentive for universities to provide more places in these courses, or perhaps even to provide those courses at all. Thus, the government is shooting itself in the footâor shooting the nation's future in the foot, if I could mangle metaphors. Under the government's plan, universities will receive 32 per cent less to teach medical scientists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They will receive 17 per cent less to teach maths students, 15 per cent less to teach clinical psychology, 10 per cent less to teach agricultural students and eight per cent less to teach nursesâthis at a time when their budgets are being hammered. How short-sighted is this? This is a bad policy from those opposite. When you cut funding support for engineering and science courses, there can only be two possible outcomes: you will get courses of a lesser standard or you will get fewer scientists and fewer engineers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government claims that its policy will create 39,000 places over three years, but, even if it does, that would be woefully inadequate when it comes to meeting demand. There is nothing in the Morrison government policy to account for the expected increased demand due to the recession or for the increased enrolments due to the so-called Costello babies now reaching university age.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is a disaster for young Australians that is being rolled out by those opposite while we're in the depths of a deepening Morrison recession. We see youth unemployment that has risen by more than 90,000 in recent months. With thousands of young people out of work, getting them into study rather than on the dole queue should be a priority for the Morrison government, but obviously it is not. The poor students who are in year 12 right now are the ones who will be most disadvantaged by this policy, and that's after they have had the year from hell. The seniors of 2020 have had such a tough, uncertain year already. Arguably no other year 12 cohort has had to endure a final year of schooling quite like they have: online classes, less face-to-face time with their mates, curtailed sports and cultural activities, no schoolies and now the Prime Minister making it harder and more expensive for them to go to universityâthe cherry on top of a rancid cake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the class of 2020 to feel the excitement that I did when I completed school: the promise of learning in an environment that fostered ideas and promised a future paved with opportunity. I don't want to see them worrying about debt before they have even walked on campus. I understand the importance of education, as so many on this side do, both as a student and as a former teacher of English. Labor has always valued education. It is the great transformational social policy, where lives are changed, lives are saved, lives are improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When in government Labor ensured that a university education was never out of reach for our best and brightest. This nation needs them. Labor invested in universities, boosting university investment from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. From 2012 we opened up the system with demand driven funding. An additional 190,000 smart Australians were able to go to university, and we ensured that structural disadvantage did not preclude a university education, something of particular benefit to those electorates represented by National Party people in this parliament. An extra 220,000 Australians were given the opportunity of a university education under Labor's policies, and I'm proud of that. That included financially disadvantaged students, whose enrolments increased by 66 per cent; Indigenous undergraduate students, whose enrolments increased by 105 per cent; undergraduate students with a disability, whose enrolments increased by 123 per cent; and students from the bush, from the regional and remote areas, whose enrolments increased by 50 per cent. Labor knows that, if you lock kids out of an education, you lock them out of employment. This government fundamentally doesn't understand that or is ignoring that fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in Australian universities is good for all of us. Labor will not oppose the bills currently before the house, but I urge the minister for education and training to give universities the support they need now and to rethink his legislative agenda that perhaps was motivated by some cruel things that happened to the member for Cook. He needs to rethink his legislative agenda and all of those things that make it harder and more expensive for students to obtain a degree.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When someone pays for a higher education experience, they need to be sure they'll get what they paid for. Over the last couple of decades there's been a rapid expansion of the private higher education and vocational education providers in the sector. Many of these providers are of outstanding quality, but, sadly, some of them have proved dodgy, and about a decade ago a number of them went bust, leaving students in the lurch. As a result of this, the Gillard government created the Tuition Protection Service. The Tuition Protection Service has assisted international students affected by the closure of an education provider on course determination. It's industry funded through an annual provider levy. It is internationally recognised as a mark of the quality and surety of studying in Australia. From 2012 to 2019 the TPS assisted approximately 12Â½ thousand international students with over 4Â½ thousand calls on funds from 47 providers that didn't meet their obligations to their students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TPS was a good idea but it never covered the whole sector. Earlier this year we saw the domestic expansion of the TPS. From 1 January the Morrison government expanded the TPS to cover domestic students receiving income contingent loans through the VET Student Loans Program or the Higher Education Loans Program for students studying with independent education providers. This means there are now around 60,000 domestic students with similar protections to international students in case a provider closes unexpectedly. The TPS helps students by placing them into a similar course with an alternative institution, by providing a refund of tuition fees paid in advance for parts of the course that were not provided to the student, or by requesting a student's HELP balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the scheme was expanded to take into account domestic students, there was a Senate inquiry at which a number of the higher education providers, or HEPs, called for the scheme to be further expanded to include all domestic students, not just those on a HELP loan. When you look at the submissions to that Senate committee, it is interesting that many of the providers who provide submissions were actually small theological colleges. One of those providers is Broken Bay Institute-The Australian Institute of Theological Education, located in Pennant Hills in my electorate. In fact, it is located just across the plaza from my electorate office. The BBI is an accredited higher education provider. Most of its courses are online. Most of them are postgraduate theological courses with students from all over Australia, including regional areas. Most of the students are primary and secondary teachers who are primarily subsidised by the employer, and many of them are teachers in the Catholic education system who want to ensure that they have appropriate theological qualifications and understanding in order to teach in that sector. They are a small HEP, and, at the time of the Senate inquiry, they had 465 active students and up to 350 unit enrolments each trimester. I thought it worth sharing with the House some of the words of the CEO, Gerard Moore, from his submission to the Senate committee, on this particular point and on why the bill before the House is so important to an institution like the Broken Bay Institute. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">BBI-TAITE supports expansion of the TPS to include domestic students with student loans. However, we believe this expansion should go further to also include domestic self-funded (fee for service) students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having to plan for and administer TPS levies and separate protection arrangements (and costs) for domestic self-funded students is not only a red-tape and reporting burden, but also a cause for confusion where there are different protection arrangements for different students. It is important for BBI-TAITE, as an independent HEP, to have equity in protections, and it is important for our students to realise this equity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, as a small HEP, the rising costs of TAS insurance has certainly been realised, with a 25% increase in premiums from 2018 to 2019. These rising market costs puts pressure on student fees as we strive to remain competitive in the market while also managing increasing operating costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Equal coverage of all students under a government managed TPS will not only provide the best protections for students, it will remove the high costs of private insurance and ensure TEQSA protection requirements are met without the need for us and other institutions to report their individual protection arrangements. If this does not occur, private insurance for self-funded students will be expensive, premiums will no doubt continue to increase, and these costs will end up being passed on to our students through increased student fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">BBI-TAITE strongly advocate for universal student protections provided by the proposed domestic TPS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education, Dan Tehan, has listened and delivered for the sector and, more importantly, for those students in the sector. Last year, Minister Tehan committed to explore options to expand the TPS to include students from the higher education sector who pay their tuition fees up-front and do not, or are not able to, access a HELP loan. The bills that are before us today give effect to this commitment, enabling the highly regarded and effective Tuition Protection Scheme to be extended to domestic upfront-fee-paying students and to have an annual levy payable by providers that contributes to the Higher Education Tuition Protection Fund. These new arrangements will ensure that all higher education studentsâregardless of whether they're domestic or international, regardless of whether they pay their fees upfront or through a loan schemeâreceive the same protections and assistance against providers defaulting on their course of study. Under the expanded TPS, if a provider goes bust, all students will either be placed into a similar course or with an alternative institution, or receive a refund of tuition fees paid in advance for parts of the course that were not provided to the student, or have their HELP balance recredited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As before, the new arrangements will be funded by the sector and not by the students. They'll be funded by a framework developed by the Australian Government Actuary which will cover the long-term costs of tuition assurance by requiring all private higher education providers to contribute annual levies commensurate with their size and risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about completing the TPS and bolstering the higher education sector as a whole. Registered higher education providers are required to have adequately resourced financial and tuition safeguards to mitigate disadvantage to students who are unable to progress their course of study due to unexpected changes in the provider's operations. At the end of last year, the last commercial tuition protection insurance provider closed its doors, and it's been a challenging time for providers like the BBI and others to meet their tuition protection obligations for domestic upfront students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills place a requirement on all private higher education providers to be a party to the TPS as a condition of registration with TEQSA, and that's a very sensible condition. This expansion of the TPS provides certainty to those students and ensures that private higher education providers will no longer have to source and secure their own tuition protection policies, which, as we've heard from the submission from the BBI, can become onerous to maintain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is good for students. This bill is good for providers. This bill is good for the higher education sector. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  I rise to speak on these two bills, the Education Legislation Amendment (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection) Bill 2020 and the Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2020, which we aren't opposing. And why would we oppose them, when the shadow minister actually wrote to the Minister for Education asking for these very changes? As members before me have noted, these bills basically mean that domestic students would not be excluded from the Tuition Protection Service. It's taken about a year since the shadow minister first raised this issue with the minister, but it's good to see that these changes are finally being adopted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always put quality education at the core of what we do in giving opportunities to young people, and, indeed, to anybody who is seeking to further themselves through higher education. If you have a look at Labor's record, particularly on universities and higher education, the last Labor government opened up universities. We had almost 200,000 additional people in higher education. We boosted investment from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. It was during those years, as well, that I was employed in the higher education sector at various universities throughout that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these policies, we saw a new kind of diversity enter into our universities. Because of Labor's policies, because of our investment in higher education and in universities, we saw the number of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds go up by 55 per cent, we saw Indigenous student numbers jump by 89 per cent, we saw enrolments by students with a disability more than double and we saw enrolments by students in country and rural areas grow by 48 per cent. These are the kinds of goals that Labor strives for when we're in government. This is the kind of investment that we believe creates a better country and a better future for our young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, Deputy Speaker, who am I to speak? I stand before you, a mere woman with four humanities degrees. Yes, Deputy Speaker, I am a humanities graduate. I suppose that as a humanities graduate I should be grateful that I have a job. I suppose that as a woman and a humanities graduate I should be grateful that I'm allowed to drive on the roads that all those non-humanities graduate people designed and built for me to drive on. I suppose that as a woman and a humanities graduate I should be grateful that my husband let me go to university and let me complete my PhD in between baking cookies and changing nappies. I suppose that as a humanities graduate I should be grateful for the sheer luck that has allowed me to be employed ever since I graduated from university. Blessed be! I should just be grateful for a whole lot of stuff as a humanities graduate, because this government would have you believe that a humanities degree is worthless. That's what this government would have you believe, yet many members of the government have benefited from access to university to pursue whatever it was they wantedâto pursue a humanities degree or a degree in any area they wantedâunencumbered by any kind of government policy, by any kind of ideological war on what they wanted to study.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like many members in this House, engage quite regularly with the high-school students in the electorate of Cowan and, indeed, beyond the electorate of Cowan as well. It's one of the joys of this vocation that we get to go and meet with young people, that we get invited to different schools to address the year 11s, the year 12s and the year 10s. It's certainly the part of this role that I enjoy the most. When I'm sitting with these young people and I'm talking to them about their futures and their careers, I ask them: 'What do you want to do?' Inevitably there are some who say, 'I don't know.' They might be in year 11 or even in year 12âsome are in year 10âsaying they've no idea what it is they want to do. I know that the advice that I give them is not much different to the advice that anybody else in here gives them. That is: do what you love and do what you're good at. That's what I did. I started out studying economics, discovered how boring that was and ended up studying my first degree in the arts, in English and comparative literature. I followed that up with a degree in linguistics, then a master of education and then, of course, a PhD. So it makes sense to me that if you pursue your passion, if you do what you love and you do what you're good at, you're going to succeed. That's probably the best bit of advice that I can give to any young person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the government introduced legislation into this House that's going to make it a lot harder for young people. Already I've had several young people in my electorate contact me, young people who had their hopes pinned on studying a degree in communication, in law, in social work or in sociology, who have said that now they're going to have to revisit their plans, the dreams that they had hoped they could achieve, because it is simply untenable for them to attend university and pay the fees that are now going to be charged under this government's legislation. Even if you accept the rationale for this, the fact is that under this legislation the government's aim of pushing young people to do degrees that they have no passion in and probably aren't even interested in or are good at is not going to work. Time and time again, we've heard the experts tell us that it's not going to work, because, under this legislation, students are going to pay seven per cent more, on average, for their degree. Forty per cent of students will have their fees increased to $14Â½ thousand a year, doubling the cost for thousands of people. That is in areas such as the humanities, commerce and communications. People studying those degrees are going to pay more for their degree than somebody studying medicine or dentistry. I just don't think that's fair. It's not that I don't think that's fair because I happen to have degrees in those areas. I don't think it's fair because I hear members on the government side talk a lot about choiceâindividual choice and opportunity and aspiration, and these are noble things. These are noble values to have. When you come into this place you want to contribute to a society and to a country where your kids and your grandkids have it better than you. That's what everybody wants. They want their kids to have more choice than them. They want their kids to have better choices than they did. So I find it incredibly unfathomable that this government would introduce legislation that increases the cost of some degrees, thereby decreasing choice for young people, particularly because many members on that side had that choice, had that opportunityâit was given to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would you want to take away something from the next generation that was given to you? Do we not come to this place to make it better for the next generation? Correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm confused. That's why I came here. I came here to make Australia better for the next generation. I came here to make sure that the next generation had more choices than I did or that my parents did. I came here to make sure that, when I leave this place, I will know that I've done everything that I can to ensure that the young people that I face in my electorate every day have it easier. So I just cannot for the life of me fathom why a government would make it more difficult, harder, and more expensive for young people to get an education, to go to university, and then stand here and talk about choice, opportunity and aspiration. If you truly believe in choice, opportunity and aspiration, then you don't cut university places, you don't make it harder for people to pursue their dreams and you don't break down dreams. That's what you're doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister spoke at length about young people taking on a $58,000 debt for a university degree. She's absolutely right when she says that a $58,000 university degree is a disincentive for a lot of young people to go to university. But I also want to talk about mature age students and what a disincentive it is for them as well, because I was one of those mature age students. I want to talk about women returning to work. Perhaps they have taken a break from work because they've been rearing children. Perhaps, like me, they never had an opportunity, because they got married young, because they had children young, because they spent their 20s rearing children and it wasn't until they were in their late 20s or 30s that they decided there was an opportunity for them to go back to university and study something and make something of themselves in that regard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about men and women who want to retrain. Perhaps COVID has forced them to look at their lives and see that they've been in a job that they haven't really enjoyed. Perhaps it's given them pause to think and perhaps it's given them the courage to finally pursue a passion by going back to university. When I went back to university, many of my classmates were mature age students. Many of them were women returning to the workforce or seeking to return to the workforce. Many of them were men and women who were seeking to retrain. When I taught counterterrorism, intelligence and security at university, many of my students were mature-age students. Many of them were former service men and women who came to do a degree to retrain and get back out there into the workforce. Why would you take that opportunity away from them? Why would you do that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">University isn't just about getting a job. Education isn't just about getting a job. Yes, you do it and you hope that it leads you to the vocation you want. You hope that, if you study something you love, with the passion that you have for it, it's going to be your career and that's where you're going to work, because you love it so much. But university doesn't always lead to a job, and the purpose of university is not always to get a job. There are a whole range of other benefits that come with a university degree. There's personal development. There's critical thinking skills and teamwork skills. There's discipline. There's self-learning and self-paced learning. There are a whole range of other skills that are applicable in any workforce and in any workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we continue to see university only as a means of getting a job, and if we continue to value university only as a means of getting a job, then we are never going to come to a position in this country where we value knowledge for its own sake. We are never going to come to a position where we can go back to a proud tradition of having some of the best universities in the world and the best education system in the world. So, while I support this bill, I reiterate that we have to see this in the context of this government's persistent battle against the universities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I rise today to support these bills, which are part of a package of legislation to expand the Australian government's tuition assurance arrangements to protect domestic upfront-fee-paying students at private higher education providers. This will ensure these students receive the same protection as students who access FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP assistance at private higher education providers. These amendments are about protecting students and, in so doing, supporting the viability of the higher education sector at this incredibly challenging time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering opportunities for higher education is important to me. I was fortunate to complete two degrees concurrently, in arts and social work, at the La Trobe University campus in Mildura, followed by a Doctor of Philosophy degree at the Australian National University. My experiences at university were some of the most rewarding of my life, and I want other people to have the opportunity to discover and explore their passions, as I have. I also believe that the intrinsic value of higher education, regardless of career or financial outcomes, is often understated. The pursuit of knowledge in and of itself is something to be encouraged and celebrated. To have a well-informed mind is a great asset, regardless of the career you undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first bill, the Education Legislation Amendment (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection) Bill 2020, amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 and the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to implement the expansion of the Australian government's Tuition Protection Service to include domestic upfront-fee-paying higher education students. Tuition protection aims to ensure that students are protected and supported in the event that their provider either fails to start to provide a unit to the student on the day on which the unit was scheduled to start or ceases to provide a unit to the student on the day after the unit starts but before it's completed. The second bill, the Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2020, imposes the upfront payment tuition protection levy, specifies the amounts that are payable by providers and prescribes the levy components and the manner in which they will be determined each year. These changes are about protecting students, and they demonstrate the government's commitment to the higher education sector. They reduce administrative burdens for providers and ensure that higher education remains affordable and accessible even during difficult times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support these changes as well as the Morrison-McCormack government's higher education reforms and Job-ready Graduates Package. The government responded to calls from the higher education sector by guaranteeing Commonwealth funding for universities even if there is a fall in domestic student numbers. This guarantee totals $18 billion in funding across the sector this year, which amounts to around 50 per cent of total revenue across the sector. Providers will also benefit from regulatory fee relief so they can focus on their operations and on supporting their domestic and international students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also working with the sector to help Australians upskill or retrain by rolling out short online courses for new students in fields of national priority such as teaching, health and agriculture. I spoke recently to the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University, Professor John Dewar, and he told me how well these courses had been taken up by students in Mildura. These short courses are heavily subsidised by the government to increase uptake, reduce costs for students and generate stimulus for education providers. I was very pleased to learn about the $251.8 million announced in the 2020 Commonwealth budget for an additional 50,000 short-course places in 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, as with many parts of the economy, universities and other higher education providers are facing extreme difficulties due to the outbreak of COVID-19. That's why it's so important to support higher education providers to increase their offerings and protect students at this difficult time. A highly educated, well-trained and skilful population is a key element of Australia's strength as a democratic nation and will be instrumental in our economic recovery on the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. We need highly educated minds to build, restore, innovate and grow. The delivery of priority infrastructure projects announced in this year's budget, the Technology Investment Roadmap in the energy sector and the implementation of the Modern Manufacturing Strategy will deliver enormous economic benefits to the country. That is why it is so important that the government, through measures such as those contained in these bills, supports the higher education sector to provide more opportunities for students and make it easier for students to take up these opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also an ever-growing need for healthcare professionals, especially in regional areas such as the electorate of Mallee, and the current crisis has laid bare the extent of that need. Delivering sufficient healthcare service provision for Mallee is a key priority for me. In Mallee we face shortages of general practitioners, nurses, and primary and allied health professionals. In 2017, the Victorian Skills Commissioner completed work in the northern half of my electorate to identify the future workforce demands of the region. The Mallee regional skills demand profile estimated that between 2017 and 2020 up to 4,400 new workers would be needed to support growth in the region. The report identified that almost one-quarter of these workers would be needed in the healthcare sector. Work has commenced to refresh this skills profile for 2020. I hope the new report shows that we have met this identified need, as I expect the future demand for the next five, 10 and 15 years will be just as great, if not greater, than in the preceding few years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been incredibly encouraging that La Trobe University has been investing in regional health qualifications through a number of initiatives to meet the expected demand. Over the past 30 years La Trobe has become integral to the Mallee community. Eighty-seven per cent of the students who graduate from the Mildura campus stay and work locally, and there are around 1,600 La Trobe graduates working in the region. The importance of this university to our region cannot be understated. The changes made by the Commonwealth government to give greater flexibility to the use of Commonwealth supported places for postgraduate courses were welcomed by Professor Dewar and La Trobe University. These changes meant that La Trobe University was able to offer a number of online postgraduate health courses to regional areas, with Commonwealth supported places attached, resulting in extensively subsidised costs. The following month Rebecca Crossling from the La Trobe Mildura campus told me that eight staff at the Mildura Base Hospital had applied for a Master of Mental Health Nursing, with a further four applying for a Masters of Mental Health. Simple initiatives like these show how the government has supported universities to provide more opportunities, making life easier for students at the same time, thereby improving outcomes for the local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">La Trobe is also doing fantastic work with their rural medical pathway program in partnership with the University of Melbourne. This program is the first to commence as part of the Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network, an initiative announced in the 2018 Commonwealth budget. Under this program 15 students from regional and rural areas begin their studies at La Trobe's Bendigo or Albury-Wodonga campuses, and undertake a three-year Bachelor of Biomedical Science degree before going on to study a four-year Doctor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne's Shepparton campus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network is one part of a $95 million investment to set up the 'train in the regions, stay in the regions' program. The guiding logic behind this program is to train locally to stay locally. We know that people from a regional city or town who learn in a regional place have the best possible chance of graduating and staying in the regions to work. There are seven Mallee students undertaking this program in 2020. They are: Alfred, Isabella, Abdo, Abigail, Kunind, Madeline and Oscar. When I met these students virtually, they all indicated they aspire to work in regional and rural areas after completing their studies. Alfred, who was born in India, says he wants to travel Australia, working in remote communities, ultimately returning to Mildura to work locally. Kunind wants to pursue a career in craniofacial surgery and hopes to bring this area of medicine to areas such as rural Victoria. This is a fantastic example of what can happen when we support higher education providers to increase their offerings and make it easier for students to take up these opportunities. There are more reasons why higher education is important for Mallee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I spoke about the need to improve access to vocational education and training opportunities to meet the rising need for skilled local jobs in Mallee due to a number of emerging industries with massive growth potential. In Mallee we have seen extensive investment and growth in solar energy. We are becoming increasingly reliant on new technologies, like artificial intelligence and robotics in agriculture and horticulture, and we are pushing for more value driven innovation and value-adding manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reason why Mallee can't be a leader for 21st century innovation, but bright minds will be required to lead these developments into the future. Again, the train local, stay local approach will be crucial to support this growth and development. I'm eager to see increased opportunities to be offered in STEM degrees in regional areas, similar to what we have seen with the Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network and the rural medical pathway program by La Trobe and the University of Melbourne. Supporting higher education providers to increase their offerings and make it easier for students to take up opportunities will improve outcomes for regional areas and will help places like Mallee meet their full potential. That's what the government aims to do with the changes outlined in these bills, and that's why I support their passage. I hope that we will continue to see further developments in higher education policy that work towards these regional goals.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  I rise to talk about the Education Legislation Amendment (Up-Front Payments Tuition Protection) Bill 2020 and Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2020 and amendments. Labor won't oppose these bills, as we heard earlier. The member for Sydney, in her speech to the chamber, was saying that in November last year she wrote to the education minister to ask him to consider exactly these changes. She voiced her concerns and outlined what the changes were and I suppose we are pleased that this particular tinkering with the education policies happened, ensuring that it will streamline some of the things that we've been talking about here tonight. It may have taken about 10 months, but we're pleased that the government has come around to legislating to tie up these loose ends and we welcome the practical effect. These changes will create simpler arrangements for students and processes for decision-making, student placements and loan recrediting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, while we welcome these tweaks to the tuition protection scheme, we also have to consider this in light of this government's policies that have been put throughâlast week we saw a particular bill go throughâand the detriment that this will have on Australia's higher education system. For months now we've been urging the federal government to step in and help universities save some of their jobs. I heard one of the members opposite saying that they didn't meet the benchmarks for assistance. Well, since this pandemic started, 12,000 jobs have been lost across the country in this sector, with thousands more predicted to go before Christmas. When you have an industry or an area where 12,000 jobs have gone and there are more to go before Christmas, if it were any other sector, whether it be mining, resources or manufacturing, there would be an outcry and the government would step in. So we cannot see the reasons why the higher education sector is not receiving the support that it deserves from this government. We want to make that point, and I want to urge the government to perhaps think about stepping in and doing something for universities to try to assist them. They are the fourth-largest exporter of this nation. They bring millions into the country. They educate the youth of this country and they're building a better Australia for the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the COVID-19 pandemic we've seen universities working brilliantly to try to come up with a vaccine. We're relying on our brilliant universities and their researchers to find a vaccine for COVID-19. Unfortunately, they can't rely on this government for a bit of assistance to save their sector. We know that Australia's going to require an additional approximately 3.8 million university qualifications by 2025, yet, when it comes to higher education and the education system, this government's priority is always to cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw in the bill that went through this place last week was that this government wants to make it more expensive for students to get a degree or to achieve their higher education aspirations. The job-ready graduates bill makes students pay more for their degrees, and thousands of students around the country will pay more than double for the same qualifications. It cuts billions from the sector while doing nothing to help young people get into higher-priority courses and jobs. What we're doing is the Americanisation of our education system, where how deep your pocket is determines the degree you get and what sort of education you're going to receive. We're going down that track, and that is wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education should be for everyone regardless of your background, regardless of which side of the tracks you come from, where your neighbourhood is or what your post code is. Education is one of the magic levers that governments have to encourage people to go to universities and to turn their lives around. If you want to make someone's life better, if you want to get someone out of poverty, the best way to do it is through education, and we have a duty as legislators and members of parliamentâand the government has a dutyâto try to better the lives of Australians that perhaps aren't as fortunate as the many in this place who went to university. I must add the majority went for free when that was introduced by Gough Whitlam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to give the opportunities to the next generations of Australians, those that perhaps are doing it tough because of their family circumstances or for whatever reason. We have to try to encourage and assist those people, and we know that one of the best levers that exists to change someone's life is education. Governments should be making it easier and encouraging people to attend universities, not making it harder by increasing fees, by not supporting the system or by having continuous cuts to the sector. It is really important that we encourage people to get a university degree or to aspire to higher education. We know that, the higher your education, the more likely you are not to be unemployed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper on Saturday, Clive Palmer's United Australia Party has already spent $400,000 on advertising in the Queensland state election, dwarfing other parties, just as it did in the federal election. Just like in the federal election, the Palmer advertisements are already full of lies. The grotesque lie of a death tax is back, just like it was at the federal election, this time with Clive Palmer inventing a fraudulent 20 per cent Labor death tax in the Queensland election. He's made this lie particularly grotesque by linking it to the voluntary assisted dying legislation. These lies and preference swaps between Palmer and the LNP are part of a coalition of convenience between Palmer and the conservatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Mr Palmer is going to spend millions of dollars in lying, the least I can do is spend five minutes telling the truth about him. Truth No 1: more than 800 workers at Queensland Nickel lost their jobs when the company went into receivership. Queensland Nickel was owned by Mineralogy, which is owned in turn by Clive Palmer and is the company which is largely bankrolling Clive Palmer's United Australia Party. These workers were not paid entitlements and the Commonwealth government had to stump up $66 million to see them partially paid. That is taxpayers' money which companies owned by Clive Palmer should have paid. It is wage theft by companies controlled by Clive Palmer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Truth No. 2: in the days before Queensland Nickel went into receivership, it made a mysterious payment of $135 million to a $2 company called, ironically enough, China First. This $2 company was controlled by Mr Palmer's wife, Anna Palmer, who is now the deputy leader of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party and their candidate in the marginal Queensland seat of Currumbin. Queensland Nickel couldn't afford to pay its workers' wages, but it could afford to pay $135 million to a company owned by Mrs Anna Palmer days before going into receivership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Truth No. 3: equally mysteriously, $180 million was transferred to a company called Palmer Investments based in Bulgaria. This transfer was approved by the now deputy leader of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party, the one and the same Mrs Anna Palmer. Truth No. 4: Clive Palmer's nephew and former fellow director of Queensland Nickel, Mr Clive Mensink, has been on the run overseas for years, avoiding arrest warrants in relation to the collapse of Queensland Nickel. Truth No. 5: Clive Palmer has been charged with fraud and breach of director duties in relation to transfers from Mineralogy to the Palmer United Party before the 2013 election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the facts about Clive Palmer. He might not want Queenslanders and Australians to know them, but they will hear them. I haven't gotten to Clive Palmer undermining the public health efforts of the Western Australian government in relation to the Western Australian border, with the support of the Morrison government, or his latest effort to fleece the taxpayers of Western Australia or his spreading of dangerous misinformation in relation to COVID-19. Clive Palmer has been called a serial pest, and he is. But he is so much more than that. His actions, his greed and his grotesque lies have caused heartache for hundreds of good Australian workersâworkers in Townsville and workers throughout Queensland who have been ripped off. His actions and his greed have seen the taxpayer stump up for his debts, debts that he should have paid. So every taxpayer in Australia has been ripped off by Clive Palmer. Clive Palmer should be ashamed to show his face in parliament. He should not be spending millions of dollars trying to take votes away from the Labor Party and influence elections like with the $60 million he spent telling lies in the last federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The behaviour you walk past is the behaviour you accept, and the LNP does more than walk past Mr Palmer's behaviour; it embraces his behaviour with dodgy, disreputable and disgusting preference deals. The LNP in Queensland putting Clive Palmer's United Australia Party before the Labor Party and other parties is a disgusting example, but it is just the latest. Mr Morrison engaged in preference deals with Mr Palmer as well. Scott Morrison and Deb Frecklington don't condemn Clive Palmer's behaviour; they reward it. They reward it with their preferences because it suits them as part of their grubby political games. They should hang their heads in shame, just as Clive Palmer should hang his head in shame and just as people involved in Clive Palmer's United Australia Party should hang their heads in shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Palmer has no place in Australian politics. He should pay his debts to the Australian taxpayer, he should pay his debts to his workers in Queensland and he should not be engaging in spreading misinformation based on those debts that he has engaged in the past. Clive Palmer is an absolute disgrace to this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  We are rightly proud in this country that, through the encouragement of risk taking and wealth creation, we are able to afford to list life-saving drugs on the PBS, enabling Australian citizens to access medicines that would otherwise be unaffordable. However, we currently have in our nation the obscenity that Australians are being denied access to a medicine, and a medical treatment, that the overwhelming evidence shows is saving lives around the world. And, yes, the medicine I am talking about is hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved in 1955, which has used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide since then and is sold over the counter in many countries today. Sadly, as we witnessed in this chamber today, some members of this House are so completely brainwashed, ill informed and ignorant that they start foaming at the mouth at the mere mention of the word 'hydroxychloroquine'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where hydroxychloroquine deniers fall into error is that they fail to distinguish between early treatment and late treatment. The brainwashed hydroxychloroquine deniers may do well to look at the recent outpatient medical treatment protocol for COVID-19 patients that was recently detailed in a peer-reviewed paper authored by over 20 medical doctors, including five PhDs, and published in no less a journal than the highly respected <span style="font-style:italic;">American Journal of Medicine</span>. This treatment protocol recommends that COVID outpatients over 50 years of age or those with a single comorbidity be immediately treated with a combination of drugs including zinc, hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic. Importantly, this paper notes: 'When started late in the hospital course and for short durations of time, antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine appear to be ineffective'. However, the paper also notes: 'When started early in the hospital course and in outpatients, antimalarials may reduce the progression of the disease, prevent hospitalisation and are associated with reduced mortality.' And here are the words from this peer-reviewed study by the lead author, Dr Peter McLeod, a Master of Public Health: 'We treat serious viral infections always with multiple drugs. Not a single drug can carry the day. Hydroxychloroquine is the most proven of the approaches. In preclinical trials, hydroxychloroquine, when utilised, is very effective. In retrospective trials and clinical studies, when employed early, 100 per cent of those studies have demonstrated a positive result. I am confident that hydroxychloroquine is safe and effective.' And the legendary Dr Zelenko recently wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The rationale for immediate treatment is because the viral load in a patient remains relatively constant during the first few days of the infection. This is when a patient has mild-flu like symptoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After five days of having symptoms, however, the Covid-19 virus begins to replicate at an exponential rate. Based on my teamâs and my treatment of thousands of patients, it is clear that after five days of symptoms most high-risk patients begin to develop devastating complications such as catastrophic lung injury and blood clots. Therefore, high-risk patients must be treated â¦ based on clinical suspicion of Covid-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore, all the studies related to the efficacy of HCQ that were performed on hospitalized and critically-ill patients either missed the boat or were designed to fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet we currently have a situation in this nation where Australians are being denied access to this potentially life-saving medicine and this potentially life-saving medical treatment, a treatment not made up by kooks and crazies but a treatment that is recommended in a peer-reviewed paper authored by 20 medical doctors, including five PhDs, and published in no less a publication than the highly respected <span style="font-style:italic;">American Journal of Medicine</span>. This ban must end. It is contrary to the peer-reviewed evidence, and Australians should no longer be denied access to a drug and a medical treatment that have been shown to save lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise tonight, sadly, to raise the health crisis that is not getting the mobilisation and focus needed. It's a shadow pandemic and an ongoing national emergency. The scourge of domestic and family violence has long simmered away in our suburbs, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions have led to a devastating escalation. Between financial stress, increased substance abuse, uncertainty about the future, increased financial stress and restricted freedom of movement, the pandemic has created a perfect storm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent National Press Club address, the chair of Our Watch, Natasha Stott-Despoja, raised some horrific statistics about the escalation in domestic violence during COVID-19. A survey of 15,000 Australian women found that nearly one in 20 of them were assaulted sexually or physically by a current or former partner between March and May. Two-thirds of those women said the violence started or escalated in that period. Reports of financial abuse are on the rise as well, with the pandemic used to justifying controlling behaviours like limiting access to money or making threats about the family's economic stability. Sadly, today in Sydney, yet another woman was killed. She had a current AVO out against her ex-partner and he is now in police custody. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These facts are raised all too often, and insufficient action results. It must change. These experiences are consistent across Australia, and in Warringah as well. In Warringah, I'm hearing from service providers like Community Northern Beaches that there has been an increase in inquiries requesting informationâwomen asking questions like 'What can I do legally? What government assistance is there if I leave? Where can I go?' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of crisis accommodation is complicated. The Northern Beaches Women's Shelter had to reduce their numbers of available beds in order to comply with COVID-19 health guidelines. They were therefore listed as having no vacancies, so homeless referrals were directed elsewhere, often to the hotel accommodation that was temporarily provided by the state governmentâand, while this was a welcome provision from the government, those hotel rooms did not necessarily come with the support networks that are needed for crisis accommodation in these cases. The shelter also reported an increase in the number of women on temporary visas experiencing homelessness due to domestic violence. At the Manly Warringah Women's Resource Centre, the spike came in July, when they had 67 women referred to them in just one month. This coincided with a dramatic rise in visits to their website: over the six months between March and August, they had a 60 per cent increase in visits to the site, with nearly 87 per cent being new visitors. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this documented escalation of violence during COVID-19, it was disappointing to see the national Women's Safety Council fail to take any further action in respect of family and domestic violence at their meeting on 7 August. Not only were there no measures committed to nor any additional funds committed; the council has reduced their meetings to once per quarter, instead of monthly. Among the sector, there is also concern about the lack of transparency in the operations of the council and their lack of consultation with service providers. Back in March, in the immediate aftermath of the horrific murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children, a letter was written by 67 groups providing services in the women's safety sector. The letter was addressed to members of the Women's Safety Council and called for urgent and immediate changes to improve women's safety. Sadly, we did not see an increase in funding in the budget announcements, and I urge the government to commit to making domestic violence a policy priority and to support the changes requested. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, any discussion about domestic or family violence raises challenges that men are victims too, and they are. But consistent research does show that the violence experienced by men and women is different. Ninety-five per cent of all victims of violence, male or female, experience it at the hands of a male. Women typically experience violence from someone they know, often over a long period of time, while men typically experience it from a stranger as a one-off event. But, let's be clear, all forms of violence must be called out and prevented. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at prevention. This is a social problem, and we all have a duty to be part of the solution. We must change this. I can't raise this issue without being concerned for anyone in such a situation, so this is a reminder to anyone in an abusive situation or concerned about someone who might be: please reach out. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="E5D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Briefly, I would like to concur with the remarks from the member for Warringah. Domestic violence, especially domestic violence against women, is an absolute scourge. Having worked with St Vincent de Paul and other organisations and coming across it, what happens to people is a complete and utter disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I was asked to do an adjournment speech. To be frank, it's the first one I have ever given in this chamber. I was rather surprised, a little bit flummoxed and I was trying to work out what on earth I was going to talk about. What would be a poignant issue for tonight? Then the obvious came to me. It's on my lapel. It's the only reason I am here. It's the people of New England, the seat of New England, the people who gave me this great honour. Country seats are like little countries. Everybody knows the electorate the town is in. They are very aware of who their local member is. I am not detracting from other areas, but in many urban seats people are not quite sure what side of the street one seat starts and another seat finishes, but they most certainly do in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My seat that I representâthe great honour of representing the seat of New Englandâis 500 kilometres long. It starts in Aberdeen and goes all the way to the Queensland border. In fact, to the north-east of the seat of New England is a seat called Wright. It goes into the suburbs of Brisbane. No-one ever thinks about just how far north it goes. The north of the seat does not work on daylight savings time. It works on Queensland time because the major towns that they deal with are all in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a child I used to put NRMA maps up on the wall. You would probably remember them. They had all the little towns. They were given to you because the roads were a little bit more confusing in those days. With those maps, as a child, I would look at all the towns and try and work outâbecause I had a fascination for politics and a desire for it from around about the age of 10âwhere the little towns are, and to try and get my mind around what the issues might be for those towns and how you could represent them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way it works is people have a view to what you have done, what you are doing and what you are planning to do. Overwhelmingly, it is not about politics; it is about delivery. I would say about 10 per cent is about philosophy and about 90 per cent is about delivery, about delivery on roads, telecommunications, health, education. So you can have people who are supporters who might not actually agree with your political philosophies on other issues, but they fight for you because of your desire to deliver. This is the sentiment of what I would like to talk about tonight. Whether it's the delivery of the Chaffey Dam; the Quipolly Dam; the Bolivia Hill realignment; the Scone bypass; the Scone saleyards; the Armajun medical centre, which is an Aboriginal medical centre; the Inverell saleyards; the movement of APVMA to Armidale; the money we've spent on the airports or smaller roads or things such as upgrading the Woolbrook Stampede Grounds, which is my local area; the Nambour showgrounds; the kitchen at Currabubula Pony Club; or the hall in Bundarra these are all incredibly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day I was out because the people of Wollomombi want a new public toilet. Other people may giggle about that but the people of Wollomombi certainly don't. They want to have handicap access to a toilet. It's an old besser block monstrosity. For the dignity of their little village they want a new public toilet. At Ebor they want to do up the Union Church. It is called the Union Church because every faith goes there, but now it's now a community centre. They also want a new bore at the local showgrounds. These are part of the plans. Big plans in the future include the construction of Dungowan Dam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the work that Minister Taylor has being doing to assist us in getting the Ovens River pumped hydro up and running. This project is going to be in excess of a billion dollars. We've put a million dollars into the feasibility study and now we're working very hard towards obtaining the finance and working with the proponents of the construction of this major piece of infrastructure, which I hope will also help us upgrade the Kempsey to Wollomombi road, which has basically fallen down the hill since the flood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I'd like to do is give a big shout-out to the Walcha Rams, my old team, who beat the Harbour Knights. They are grand final championsâ2Â½ thousand people beating a city of 70,000. Well done, boys!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Tomorrow, 21 October, is headspace Day. I want to talk about some of the wonderful work that headspace does in my electorate. Headspace Day promotes mental health literacy among people aged 12 to 25 throughout Australia. In my electorate headspace has supported 809 young people throughout 2019 and 2020 to better manage their mental health and strengthen their wellbeing. I have been a long-time supporter of headspace because I have seen the fantastic work they have done on the New South Wales South Coast over many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luckily, Nowra has a full headspace, which has supported local young people for years, but that support has never been more important than it has been this year. Young people have been some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, but before that in my electorate they also had to contend with a summer of bushfires. Sadly for many young people, their family home and parents' livelihoods were lost during the fires. With an economy heavily reliant on tourism, many young people also lost their summer income with shops closed, holiday rentals empty and cafes without customers, but headspace has been there supporting the community every day. I was lucky enough to pop into the Nowra youth markets recentlyâa wonderful initiative of headspace and Sonder Youth. I was impressed by the entrepreneurship of so many local young people at these markets. There were artists selling photography and paintings, home-made jewellery, candles and wraps, artistic chopping boardsâthe list goes on. There was live music playing, and it was fantastic to see young people who might have lost work from this year's hits getting support from the local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the bushfires, headspace Nowra has also held, among other things, a range of free skateboard workshops in partnership with Totem Skateboarding. They were in areas like Ulladulla, Culburra Beach, Sussex Inlet and Sanctuary Point giving people a place to go, something to do and, more importantly, something to look forward to. Young people knew there was someone there who would listen, someone there who could help if they needed it. That is why I was pleased to see the individual placement support trial at Nowra headspace extended as part of the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of the great work of Nowra headspace that during the election campaign I pushed hard for a full headspace to be delivered in Batemans Bay. With the nearest headspace in Bega, there was a huge gap in services for the northern Eurobodalla, and I wanted to make sure local young people in the Batemans Bay area could see the same benefits that I had witnessed in Nowra. Thankfully, the government matched my commitment at the election, and in the wake of the bushfires I fought hard to have that funding brought forward. The need was now; our young people could not afford to wait. I was pleased to see an interim headspace open in Batemans Bay in the months following the bushfires, and I know it is already having a huge impact out and about in the local community. I look forward to seeing the new full headspace open soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to sincerely thank all our headspace and other mental health workers for everything you are doing to help local young people. Sadly, my electorate, particularly the Kiama and Gerringong areas, has been dealing with the consequences of mental ill health in recent months, with a spike in suicides among local young people. These tragic events are a reminder of why we need things like headspace Day and why we need to raise awareness of mental health assistance. Our local communities have rallied together in an inspiring way, doing their important part to help those who are struggling. Our local towns turned yellow, and the Kiama and District Stronger Community initiative was born, holding workshops and events to improve the collective mental wellbeing of the region. I was delighted to attend the mental health town hall meeting last week at The Pavilion in Kiama. I thank all of the organisers for their work in getting this underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year has shown us that we can never take the mental wellbeing of our community for granted, so this headspace Day I want to show my support not just for headspace but for all the local organisations working hard to improve our community mental wellbeing and resistance, and I encourage others to inspire and share the small steps you take to support your mental health. We really will get through this together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  Edith Cowan University, based in my electorate, has been allocated $245 million in the federal budget to establish a new campus, specialising in creative industries, business and technology courses. The satellite campus, which will be based in Perth central business district and will house the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, is scheduled to open in 2025 at a total cost of $695 million, with the university contributing $300 million and the WA state government providing land worth $150 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public awareness of the significance of this funding commitment to the higher education sector in Perth is only just beginning to be realised, with many residents still relatively unaware of the scale of the tertiary education project. For residents in my electorate, it means a wider range of courses and subjects to choose from, and access to a broader selection of learning facilities and educational resources to equip them for future careers in the workforce. This investment by the federal government transcends electoral boundaries. It does not matter where students live, their access to world-class educational facilities is literally on their doorstep within the Perth metropolitan area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Perth city campus will complement the courses offered at ECU's main Joondalup campus, based in the Moore electorate. It is expected to accommodate more than 8,000 students and 1,200 staff. The new campus should not be viewed as competing with the Joondalup campus. To the contraryâhaving a campus based in Western Australia's capital city will function as a gateway to channel international and interstate academics, students and researchers to ECU, putting it on the map. The modern, state-of-the-art facilities will boost the reputation of the university, which already ranks among the world's top 100 universities under 50 years old, enhancing the status of its alumni and the prestige of its degrees. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the futuristic vision of the vice-chancellor, Professor Steve Chapman, who, in a few short years since arriving in Australia and commencing his tenure, has led the ECU team to institute what is a transformational education asset for the benefit of future generations. Professor Chapman first briefed me on his visionary plans to establish a capital city campus more than two years agoâa massive undertaking for both government and the university. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution of the Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure, the Hon. Alan Tudge, must be recognised. Minister Tudge visited the electorate on two occasions to discuss the federal government's City Deals program, more broadly. We met with the City of Joondalup mayor, Albert Jacob, and the chief executive officer, Gary Hunt, to discuss our regional infrastructure needs for a growing population. I also thank the Minister for Finance, Western Australian Senator Mathias Cormann, who was instrumental in turning this ambitious proposal to expand our local university into a reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the construction phase, the project is expected to deliver $1.5 billion in economic activity and create more than 3,100 local jobs, adding to the government's economic stimulus program. The campus site is located at the central Perth City Link, adjoining the railway station. Interestingly, the northern suburbs railway passes adjacent to ECU's Joondalup campus, effectively directly connecting both campuses with public transport. It is envisaged that the creative and performing arts talent to be nurtured at the city campus will add to the entertainment offering for visitors to Perth city, particularly during the evenings, supporting the local hospitality industry and adding vibrancy. If the City of Perth succeeds, then all of us, as Western Australians, collectively share in that success as our capital city prospers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to congratulate the newly elected Lord Mayor of Perth, Basil Zempilas, and wish him all the best in transforming Perth. This $245 million investment by the Morrison government to expand our local university is good for our capital city and positive for Western Australia, as it expands the higher education opportunities for the younger generation across the Perth metropolitan area.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Last week I was honoured to attend the launch of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Inala 4077 Street Names</span> book. The suburb of Inala is iconic. Not only does it fall in my federal electorate but also it makes up a large part of my good friend Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's state electorate of Inala. Five years ago Aaron Hagenbach published the first issue of this book. It was a limited edition. He gifted two copies to the Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group. Late in 2019 local councillor Charles Strunk was given a copy. The councillor was so impressed with the quality and uniqueness of this publication he hoped to donate a copy of the book to each of the school libraries in the Brisbane City Council ward of Forest Lake. After meeting with the history group members, Aaron was contacted and agreed to reprint, so the huge project became a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aaron Hagenbach is an Inala boy. He and his family grew up in the suburb of Inala. He went to local schools and then to the University of Queensland. Aaron lived in the trees neighbourhood, whilst others lived in the birds or the stars. Inala is a unique suburb. It's probably the only one with street names in such clusters. Then there are the names themselves. There's Ilex Street, Algol Street, Skua Street and many more. Aaron went on a research adventure to work out who named the streets and where they came from. With the help of the Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group, he researched every name and then walked every one of the 199 streets with his camera. Today I acknowledge his work in the Parliament of Australia and thank the history group for all of their support for this project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I wish to also acknowledge and celebrate the life of Glenda McCoy. Glenda was a community leader who was much loved and respected by all those she worked with and supported. I know because I was one of those people who received so much support from Glenda. As a local councillor, and in recent times in my role as the federal member for Oxley, I witnessed her kindness and generosity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Glenda was guided by her deep commitment to faith, family and community, whether it be her dedicated advocacy for seniors and the welfare of her fellow neighbours and friends, particularly through the Inala Pensioners League. As Treasurer not one cent was ever out of place and not accounted for. Her smiling face was always welcome in the most trying and difficult of times when community events wouldn't go to plan. As a founding member of the South West Progress Association she was able to support many community events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a representative, you couldn't ask for someone more loyal and dedicated when you needed help. Election campaigning will simply not be the same without Glenda McCoy working at Richlands East State School on election day. There was a reason I, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, local councillor Charles Strunk and those in the Labor Party referred to her as one of our golden girls. She truly believed in the care of others and a fair go for those in need. On a personal level, I will miss our jokes, laughs and big hugs and the twinkle in her eye. May our golden girl rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Diwali is a festival that celebrates the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance and hope over despair. This year it is celebrated on Saturday 14 November. It also marks the beginning of the Hindu new year. Known as the Festival of Lights, Diwali sees homes filled with diyas and children playing with sparklers. It is one of India's, and increasingly Australia's, most beloved and vibrant festivals. Families and friends come together, share meals, exchange gifts and feast in each other's homes, which are decorated vibrantly to celebrate the joy that this time in the calendar brings. This year, perhaps more than any other that I can remember, we desperately need the message of Diwali, a message that stretches beyond religions and cultures and I know resonates with all Australians. That message is the reaffirmation of hope and the celebration of joy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diwali is a time to reflect on what we uphold as important. On that score it is important for us to reflect on the relationship between Australia and India at this time, a relationship that is growing, is blooming and is really something to celebrate. This year at the virtual leaders summit Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Modi signed a comprehensive strategic partnership, taking the relationship with India to a whole new level and bringing India to the forefront of those important strategic relationships that Australia has. When I reflect on the bridge between the two countries, I think of the 700,000 strong Indian diaspora here in Australiaâ6Â½ thousand of whom are in my own electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, while it has had many challenges, it's brought out the best in us, and the best in us has often been demonstrated by the Indian community. I've seen many in our Indian community going out of their way to help their neighboursâhelping with shopping, opening their homes as refuge and leaving cooked meals at the doors of family and friends. Earlier this year during the bushfire crisis, many Indian Australians travelled from their homes to bushfire affected areas. Some of those worked in the RFS as volunteers. Many other Indians of every creed provided food and support to volunteers and to people affected by the bushfires. That same kindness is my experience of Indians generally. When we've needed Indian Australians most, they've been there to assist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love attending our local Diwali celebrations, but many of them won't be taking place this year or won't be taking place in the same format. I usually go to the Hindu Council, the India Club, the Diwali Milan, the BAPS Temple at Rosehill and the Turramurra Gurudwara. Some of those will be on, but many of them won't be. But the spirit of Diwali and those messages of the triumph of hope over despair, knowledge over ignorance, light over darkness and good over evil are still messages that need to resound for us in this particular year. Let me take this opportunity to wish everyone in the Indian community shubh Diwaliâa very happy Diwali.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  The government is leaving Western Sydney behind. The government recently announced $700 million for construction of business fibre zones, where business can have access to higher speeds, and I was hopeful. Then I looked at the detail to find that, of the 11 business zones announced for Greater Sydney, only one is west of Marrickvilleâone in Australia's third-largest economy. The others are in Botany, the Central Coast, Double Bay, Rose Bay, Gosford, Lake Haven, Wyong, Lane Cove, Marrickville, Mosman, Neutral Bay, Randwick and Parramatta. Eight of the 11 are on the harbour or the ocean. It's great for me that it's in Parramatta, except the Parramatta CBD won't be getting any form of NBN at all until 2022. But, even then, we need strength around it, and this is not a plan to deliver for Western Sydney. There's no hub in Strathfield, Liverpool, Campbelltown, Penrith, Norwest, Blacktown Bankstown or even Ryde. This makes no sense at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney is Australia's third-largest economy. We account for more than half of Sydney's population growth, at 52 per cent. In 2018, there were 1.12 million employed residentsâbigger than the workforce in Adelaide and Perth, and 10 per cent shy of Brisbane. Knowledge workers accounted for 14.5 per centâa greater proportion than Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth. We've seen some jobs growth, but 80 per cent of that growth is in population driven sectors. We need the NBN to grow and do as well as we can. We need fast, reliable internet connection now. It's a basic infrastructure. If you don't give it to us, you really are leaving us behind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government's changes to university funding have gone through the parliament, and they are not good for Western Sydney. The government is leaving Western Sydney behind. The government changed the funding model to, as they say, 'tip the balance towards regional universities', where university attainment rates are low compared to city rates. That's of course necessaryâwe need to raise the rates. But so too should they work to raise the rates in large parts of Western Sydney, where attainment rates are lowerâyes, lowerâthan they are in regional areas, even remote regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Fowler, around Cabramatta, the attainment rate is 12.7 per cent; in Lindsay, around Penrith, it's 13.5 per cent; in Macarthur, around Campbelltown, it's 14.4 per cent; in McMahon, around Prospect, it's 14.5 per cent; in Werriwa, around Liverpool, it's 15.2 per cent; and, in remote Australia, it's 16.3 per cent. So all of those areas of Western Sydney have lower rates than remote regional Australia. If the government really care about attainment rates and raising them, it's absolutely outrageous that they would leave behind the part of Australia which has one of the lowest attainment rates in the countryâand this is what they've done. Unless they address this, they are leaving Western Sydney behind.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I was pleased to inspect the first works associated with the Fig Trees on Manning project on the banks of the Manning River. I was there with Denis Hawkins, CEO of Bushlands Health. Fig Trees on Manning is a vertical seniors living and retirement complex that Bushland Health will be delivering. It is only happening because of an $8.5 million investment into Bushland Health and the project from the federal coalition government. The development will not only have infrastructure like the bridge across Browns Creek, which will link the CBD to the Figtrees on the Manning development and over to Chatham; two bridges will be constructed for both walking and bicycle access. All of this public infrastructureâthe bridges, the roads, the traffic lights and all the upgrades that Bushland Health are doingâwill trigger $455 million of investment from other private capital into a masterplan precinct, including apartments, retail and commercial areas, cafes, outdoor public spaces and a marina. There will also be a refurbishment of the historic dairy factory that served the dairy farmers of the Manning and the Great Lakes. It is a great project.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to be in Wingham to announce a million dollar grant from the federal government's Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program funding round for the upgrade and revitalisation of the Wingham CBDâfootpaths, pedestrian areas, drainage and civil works all around the Wingham CBD. This project has been on the local council's books for over 10 years, and I'm so pleased that the local roads and community infrastructure fund is making it a reality. The local MidCoast Council are contributing $3 million themselves, so it will be a major project indeed. The total for the project will be $3 million-plus. It will change the dynamic. It is a destination for shopping and the food-and-entertainment precinct of Wingham, because it's centred around a historic square. It's going to put a whole new level of complexity and attraction into the Wingham CBD. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to the strength and resilience of the people of Gorton in the fight against COVID-19. Gorton has been hit hard by the pandemic, with the two municipalities within my electorate, Brimbank and Melbourne, having the second- and fifth-highest case numbers in the country. Parts of Gorton have faced the longest lockdowns in the country. People have been kept from loved ones for months, even if they live only a few suburbs away, birthdays have been spent alone at home, weddings have been cancelled, families have not been able to attend funerals, and businesses, particularly small businesses, have faced unprecedented restrictions, albeit for legitimate public health reasons. I want to acknowledge, and show my appreciation for, the patience and resilience of each and every resident of my electorateâevery small-business owner and every worker in Gorton and across Melbourne. Labor knows you are struggling and how truly tough this has been. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While no-one has enjoyed these measures, the need for these restrictions has been abundantly clear. We must never forget that. One only has to look at the figures from countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and many, many other places to know that Victoria's measures have worked: they've saved lives and they've kept people safe. Let's take the daily case numbers on 3 August. In Victoria, we had 687 new cases, and the United Kingdom had 670. Today, Victoria had one case and no deaths, while the United Kingdom had 18,804 cases and, tragically, 80 deaths. This is a testament to every Victorianâindeed, every Melburnianâwho has done the right thing. Melbourne still hasn't reached the end goal, but we are very, very close. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this COVID normal comes the recovery for small businesses and other businesses across my electorate and across the great city of Melbourne. It's been absolutely vital that, firstly, people comply with the restrictions. Secondly, it's been important to focus on the health needs of Victorians first so we can move to an economic recovery. The idea you could find some midpoint where you only bring in restrictions in a second wave, I think, has been found to be false. The reality is: if we had not heeded the advice of the experts, we would be now not suppressing this second wave. Frankly, if you look at the efforts around the world to suppress second waves, no-one has done it better than Victorians, and they deserve the credit for that effort. Now we need to focus on the economic recovery. We want to see, indeed, efforts by the Commonwealth, the federal government, to do the right thing for businesses. We'll be looking at the announcements in the budget to see whether there's enough. On the first look, I have to say there's not enough for businesses in my electorate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  As part of the next stage of the Mitchell Freeway extension northwards from Hester Avenue to Romeo Road, Lukin Drive should be extended by approximately 800 metres east from the new interchange with the Mitchell Freeway, to connect with Wanneroo Road. Local rural landowners, business operators and the North Wanneroo Residents Association strongly support the creation of the new east-west link between Marmion Avenue and Wanneroo Road. Their concerns have not been satisfactorily addressed as part of the community consultation process, despite them providing some very sound economic and public safety arguments in support of their case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important east-west link will reduce congestion by providing an alternative route for commuters travelling to and from the rapidly developing coastal suburbs along Marmion Avenue and the employment zone to the east. Vehicles carrying freight and agricultural produce to markets will have additional route options without having to use the busy school precinct at Hester Avenue. If overlooked, Lukin Drive will be the only freeway interchange in Perth without an east-west connection. Currently the nearest east-west connections between Wanneroo Road and Marmion Avenue are located two kilometres south of Lukin Drive, at Hester Avenue, and three kilometres north of Lukin Drive, at Romeo Road. This translates to commuters being forced to drive the extra distance to go around each day and additional travel times for emergency vehicles responding to urgent situations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental concerns could be addressed through the provision of tunnels under the road for wildlife migrating through the national park, as is currently the case at other locations within the Neerabup National Park. In the event of bushfires or natural disasters, having Lukin Drive as a public road provides a firebreak and additional detour options for residents fleeing potentially dangerous situations. Accordingly, in the interests of public safety, I call upon Main Roads and the WA state government to investigate the inclusion of the 800-metre east-west extension of Lukin Drive to Wanneroo Road as part of the project's scope to extend the Mitchell Freeway to Romeo Road. It makes sense to build the road now rather than incurring higher costs in the future, when the intersections will have to be reconstructed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I rise today to speak on behalf of travel agents across Australia and particularly in my community in Dunkleyâsmall and family businesses who have been absolutely decimated by the impact of the global pandemic and the necessary closure of borders, and decimated not just for this year but, it looks like, for a significant time into the future. I want to thank Linda Forster particularly, a local travel agent who came to my small-businesses Zoom forum with the shadow minister for small business. She raised travel agents in that forum and has provided me with a significant amount of background information. Because of her work, I held a Zoom forum last week with the shadow minister for tourism and local travel agents, to really understand and talk about not just what they're going through but what they need from the federal government for support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to COVID-19, travel agencies were thriving businesses, with year-on-year growth of 7.2 per cent over the last five years. Because of what's happened this year, 40,000 travel agents have been impacted, $6 billion has had to be, rightly, refunded to travellers, and $4 billion in refunds are still to go out. What's not widely understood is that that includes commissions that travel agents got six months ago, 12 months ago or 18 months ago and have already spent. Now they have to pay them back. Travel agents book about 70 per cent of consumers' international travel, and the majority of their revenues have fallen in excess of 90 per cent. Seventy-one per cent of travel agents are women, who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And 61 per cent of small businesses with no employees and sole traders are travel agents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The travel agents that participated in my forum gave me invaluable insight into what they're going through. Chantal's been working in this industry for nearly 21 years. She has a mortgage, she has children's school fees which are on hold, she's trying to pay her bills and keep a positive outlook, she's searching for other jobs on Seek, and she is struggling to get employed. As she said, she works two jobs in travel, they've both been severely affected, and she really wants some assistance for her dying industry. Angela has a three-year lease for a shopfront of about $150,000 a year. How is she going to keep paying that? Natalie and her boss have had to take on other work. Hans raised commissions having to be paid back. As Trish said, 'No-one's holiday will be anything like as good as one booked through your travel agent.' Travel agents were missed entirely in the budget. The budget measures do not help travel agents. They need specific, tailored assistance. As Linda says, 'A campaign to encourage Australians, when they do travel domesticallyâand, in the future, overseasâto book with travel agents, not with websites where the money goes offshore.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I'd like to talk today about the issue of water infrastructure. It's so vitally important. I want to commend the LNP in Queensland for their policy stance with regard to the Bradfield Scheme. This is an immensely important piece of infrastructure, not just for Queensland but for our nation. To bring water from Hells Gate in the Far North, where rivers such as the Ross River spill up to 176 gigs a dayâthat means that, in two days, they would fill Sydney Harbourâto the Fitzroy, then to the Thompson, and then to the Warrego, which ultimately would bring it down through the Darling River system and into South Australia, would be an incredible piece of infrastructure, an incredible piece of architecture for Australia, that would assist so greatly in dealing with the paucity of water that's so apparent in the southern part of our nation. As well, it would open up vast areas of irrigational land in the western parts of Queensland. This is real vision. It's a shame the Labor Party in Queensland doesn't have it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to talk about water infrastructure in my electorate of New England. Water infrastructure has always been at the forefront of what I believe my purpose in politics for my people is. The moment I got back, we went to the stalled Chaffey Dam expansion, which didn't have approval or enough money, and got that underway. That took it from 60,000 megs to 103,000 megs. By so doing, it allowed the city of Tamworth to get through the last drought without running out of water. That's incredibly important. The next step was Quipolly Dam, at Werris Creek. With the large expansion of the transport and timber industries, it's become yet another growth hub in New England. With Quipolly Dam, that expanded the capacity and also the transfer and augmentation of that water system. On top of that, we had water treatment for Tenterfieldâa project not as large as the others but incredibly important. And, of course, there's Dungowan Dam, and the Commonwealth has contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to that project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next one is the pumped hydro facility on the Ovens River, east of Armidaleâa project in excess of $1 billion. The Commonwealth has already put up $1 million for the feasibility, and I welcome the state government making sure that it's a streamlined process when the Commonwealth gets the money. There were some people who thought that the state government's approval of a streamlined process was approval of the money. I wish it was, but it wasn't. Now we'll have to go and fight. I've been working very closely with Minister Taylor to make sure that we get our hands on, via ARENA or the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, in excess of a billion dollars that will be lent out to build this massive piece of infrastructure. It's yet more delivery for New England.</span>

                  </a>  Before the suspension I was saying that it would've been nonsense a year ago but now it's part of our language and, for the foreseeable future, a part of our way of life. What's come home to us is that social connection maintains both physical and mental health of people and communities. Our thoughts in recent months have of course been with Victorians in particular, who have endured lockdowns and missed those connections. Thankfully, with just one case recorded today, it seems the sacrifices that Victorians have made have finally paid off.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent the week between the sittings visiting towns and communities the length and breadth of my amazing electorate. First up was the Railton Neighbourhood Centre in the north-west, where I caught up with Di and her terrific team. They'd been looking forward to the Kentish Neighbour Day planned for Saturday, but it had to be cancelled due to stormy weather. In typical Tassie fashion, they won't let a little bad weather get them down and there will be another event to bring the community together before we know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the rest of the week I travelled through Deloraine, Perth, Longford, Sorell and Bridgewater. On Sunday, a few hours before catching my flight to Canberra, and just hours after I had attended the Deloraine Roos grand final victory nightâcongratulations to the Deloraine Roos on their grand final victory in the NTFAâI attended the Brighton Alive Spring Food Festival at the Gagebrook Community Centre. This is an event that celebrates the start of spring. It was great to see so many community members getting together, with face painting for the kids, great food, the ever popular Snakes Alive stall with the tiger snakes and copperheads and the exhibition there, and community exhibitors providing advice on services. Well done to Helen and Cheynee from Jordan River Service and their team of fantastic volunteers, including Ian, Laurie, Elsie, Anna, Allan and Fred, for putting together such a fantastic day. I also had a chat with Melissa from Midway Point Neighbourhood House, which will be celebrating five years of its community garden next month, with a big day planned including a sausage sizzle, raffle, food stalls and garage sale. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I was at the spring fair my team was 162 kilometres away at the other end of my electorate, attending our stall at the Evandale Market, which has recently started back up. They reported to me that the day started slowly, but it soon picked up, and people were really travelling through this fantastic market. The strength and resilience of these organisations and, indeed, all community groups across Australia, deserves to be recognised. I thank the people and volunteers who work so tirelessly for the vital role they play in supporting our regions through this most difficult time. </span>

They're united when they're saying, 'Tell Morrison, tell the Prime Minister, tell the boss he's doing a good job.' I'd like to put that on the record. As politicians we are very quick to go back and share with our leaders the bad news that travels through our electorates, but in this case I think it's only fair that I place on the public record to the Prime Minister the message that's come from the electorate. They were happy with the leadership during the COVID process. They were happy with his communication and the narrative, and they were happy with the financial assistance that has come out of the budget. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other benefits that's come out of this horrific COVID-19 process has been the establishment of the national cabinet. Punters in my electorate have also seen that as a great step forward. When people put aside politics and work for the benefit of all the nation, that's when as politicians we are at our best. So please take that on board as we come out of the COVID environment. The national cabinet has been a vehicle which has been looked on fondly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the budget, particularly within my area of the road safety and freight transport sector, the instant asset write-off, which is extended to $150,000, I want to make the particular point that that includes second-hand equipment. So if you're looking to upgrade trucks, tractors, harvesters, headers, any type of capital equipmentâyou remember that in earlier days it used to be $25,000, but we have extended it out to $150,000âit includes second-hand equipment. The temporary full expensing is for new equipment. That's the one that's out to an unlimited amount, and it catches 99 per cent of all businesses in the country. The temporary full expenses is a lifesaver for the transport industry. A prime mover is between $350,000 and $450,000. That was just outside the cap of the instant asset write-off. This temporary full expensing has done amazing things as a stimulus. I spoke the other day to Andrew Hadjikakou, the CEO of PACCAR. Not many people know that we build and manufacture Kenworths right here in Australia, in Melbourne, under the current situation. Andrew told me that his order book is as full as it's ever been. That's amazing. In my last couple of seconds, a shout-out to all the year 12 students in the electorate who are sitting their exams. My thoughts and love are with you all. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  What a time in the history of this proud nation that we are living through and what a budget the most recent budget was. These are quite exceptional times, and in exceptional times exceptional things have to be done. The hallmark of this budget is that it is a budget for the time. The world has been thrown into a recession as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether you like it or not, we have done very well compared to the rest of the world. We came into this budget and this pandemic in a good fiscal situation and we have acted in a manner that will support the economy, which is currently in the throes of travelling out of the pandemic induced recession. First of all, we softened the blow and now we are thinking all about recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has brought forward the personal tax cuts that were promised for the forward years. We have brought them forward so that now over 11 million taxpayers in Australia will be better off by paying less tax and keeping more of what they earn. In my electorate of Lyne that amounts to 51,500 taxpayers. The maximum benefit they will get will be $2,745 this financial year. There is also support for 15,900 businesses in the Lyne electorate, with the instant asset write-off ramped up so that any eligible capital expenditure can be written off in this financial year. It will allow businesses to purchase equipment to grow their industrial or business capacity, it will improve their cash flow, and it will hopefully trigger a lot more economic output and activity. There is also JobKeeper, JobSeeker and all those other COVID-related responses that are being supported by this budget. Around 9,905 individuals received the coronavirus supplement. Some 4,200 small and medium businesses have accessed the improving cash flow initiative, which was the first cash adjustment made early in the pandemic response. In the Lyne electorate, 30,576 age pensioners received $750 cash payments in April and July, and this budget is offering them another $250 cash payment in December and a further $250 cash stimulus in March next year. Because Lyne has such an ageing demographic, we have many carersâ3,312 carers. As I mentioned, there are 30,576 pensioners, and we have a large cohort of veterans as well, so it's no surprise that we have so many carers. They have received extra support payments of $750. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, there are so many things in this budget that are designed to get our economy back on its feet and up and running. We have kept control of the health situation, which means that, even though our economy has gone into recession, we're so much better off in a financial sense than other nations who haven't controlled the pandemic as well as Australia has. One of the most tangible and immediate stimulus packages in the infrastructure space is the local roads and community infrastructure spending that was announced. We brought forward $500 million before the budget, and another billion dollars has gone into that. For people listening in my electorate, that means that Dungog council is getting and extra $1.2 million that they would not have budgeted for a year ago; MidCoastâ$8.1 million; Maitland councilâ$3.7 million extra this year; Port Stephensâ$3.2 million extra this year; and Port Macquarie-Hastings Councilâ$5.25 million. That's on top of financial assistance grants: Dungogâ$2.7 million; MidCoast Councilâ$18.25 million; Maitlandâ$7.1 million; Port Stephensâ$6.75 million; and Port Macquarie-Hastings Councilâ$9Â½ million. That is very tangible and very immediate support. The initiatives that have been announced are really coming home. Just last week I was in Wingham. They're bringing forward a whole revitalisation of the Wingham CBD. It is going to be a game-changer for Wingham. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, we've got a large cohort of elderly in the Lyne electorate, and aged care is a huge part of our economy. When I first entered parliament representing the Lyne electorate, spending in the Lyne electorate was $90 million per year. Due to incremental increases in the intervening years and in this budget, it's now up to $180 million per year. We are all familiar with the aged-care crisis, but there is good news. The latest figures show that the home-care shortage has finally peaked and that the number of people waiting for home-care packages has dropped. Aged-care funding overall has similarly grown from $13 billion in 2013 up to $24 billion. That's a massive increase in such a short time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You probably recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilson, that before the budget there was an announcement released about another 6,000 homecare packages. Well, this budget brings on another 23,000 packages. The cost of this is quite exceptionalâ$1.9 billion. It is making a huge difference. The figures in the homecare national prioritisation system reveal that there has been a 20 per cent decrease year on year to March 2020, and that's before these extra homecare places are released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are all the COVID support measures for mental health and for general health in the budget, including in the aged-care space. The COVID-19 aged-care response now totals $1.6 billion. Whether it is increased cash payments for staffing costs or COVID PPE, it covers all sorts of things. There is also extra funding for aged care and training in dementia support. Unfortunately, we have a very high incidence of dementia because of our demographic. We also get extra funds to help young people who have ended up in aged care. Where there has been nowhere to care for them, in a chronic sense, if they've had physical or brain injuries, they've often ended up in aged care. But in this budget there is a plan to move younger people out of aged care and into more appropriate settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I practised medicine for 33 years before I was given the honour of standing in this room and in this building. The general health budget funding is quite staggering, is quite exceptional. It's $467 billion over the forward estimates. That's $32 billion more. These figures are staggering, but the important thing is what they are delivering. They're not just delivering more money; they are delivering significant changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Medicare guarantee in place. Every year there is a requirement to find and fund new medicines, and there is a new initiative in this budget. There is an extra $700 million in the pharmaceutical budget to allow for this exponential growth in complex personalised medicine, biological drugs et cetera. Just to give you some examples of some of the new things being funded, there are new biological drugs for ovarian cancer, liver cancer, a rare eye diseaseâit's actually not that rare; about 500 people each year lose their vision because of a development of new vessels in the back of their eye, but this new treatment will give them hope. There is also stuff for small chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, and for a nasty variety of lung cancer there is a second line biological treatment. It is really exciting for people in the health space to be able to offer people with these unfortunate diagnoses chances of longer survival, better quality of life and, in some cases, a cure. We all know how many diabetics there are in the country. There is another new medicine, semaglutide, for diabetes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put record funding into supporting public hospitals and into intergovernmental agreements. We are reforming private health insurance. A really notable improvement is that dependents can stay on the family insurance policy up to the age of 31. Hitherto, it was up to age 24. Once you struck that age, you had to fend for yourself. It is also great that people with a disability can stay under the health insurance provided by their parents. There are many people with major disabilities who do stay dependant on their parents, and this will give them another level of support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the mental health problem around the country has been exacerbated by COVID and the isolation forced on people by lockdown. There is a massive $5.7 billion to be spent on mental health alone in this financial year. Of note is an expansion of the headspace network around the country. Currently there are 124 services, and that's growing to 153 by 2022. And, over the next four years, that's $630 million into the headspace network. That's really important because in Taree, in the centre of the Manning Valley, there was a commitment to deliver a headspace centre and the funding for that will come out of this appropriation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on just on all the other things in preventative health. There's a life-saving medical research initiative where there'll be regionally-funded research trialsâthat's $125 million. In rural medical and nursing and allied health training, there's another $50.3 million to start another university department of rural health. The list goes on. There's funding for vaccines. There's funding for more research. The Medical Research Future Fund is now delivering all the dividends that were promised when it was set up. We are also funding extra into the aged-care system for development and research. It is really staggering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more things that will benefit everyone in regional Australia, including in telecommunications. There's another extra round of funding for the Regional Connectivity Program. There was over $50 million put into this in the 2019-20 budget, and there's another $30.3 million. In the budget, for regionalisation and decentralisation there's $41 million of new funding to bring forward our decentralisation agendaâthat's not necessarily public service or public government bodies decentralising but private decentralisation. And that's really become turbo charged because people have found with the COVID pandemic the wonders of living in regional Australia. People are buying into regional centres up and down the north coast, and over the Blue Mountains they're just going absolutely ballistic. It's like people have had the sleep taken from their eyes and they've realised how great regional Australia is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have extra road funding all over the country, including for road safety. Unfortunately, a lot of the deaths and major injuries around road safety happen in regional Australia, so it's really great that we've got a special fund set aside to improve road safety around the nation. That's what you get when you have regional members fighting the good fight in this building to get a fair deal for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on and on. There is so much in this budget. As I've said, exceptional times require exceptional responses, and there's no shortage of funding for all those other areas. We're familiar with the defence budgetâthat's massive. We've got a manufacturing recovery plan. We're supporting apprentices. We're getting extra training places in TAFE. We're subsidising over 100,000 apprentices because we know they are vulnerable in this situation. We're building our skills. There's a huge spend on education, healthâyou name it. But, when it comes to managing things, we've had the books balanced before, so we'll get there again, but it's going to be<span style="font-style:italic;">â</span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  One of the things I was really disappointed about in this budget was that it didn't address an issue that has been a gaping wound in my electorate for many, many years, and that's a piece of Commonwealth owned property which is a former Red Cross hall at Greenslopes, right across the road from the Greenslopes Private Hospital. This is Commonwealth owned property. It's a hall. It's an asbestos risk. There are fences up and there is shade cloth around the fences. It's been like this for years, and I've been lobbying the government over that entire time to get it fixed. There are signs up saying, 'Asbestos' and, 'Brittle roof'. It's a really dangerous thing and it ought to have been fixed years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the asbestos risk, the other problem with this hall is of course that it's just a waste. This is a piece of Commonwealth property that could be a really great community facility. It could be being used to assist the veteran community. Of course, the Gallipoli foundation across the road at Greenslopes Private will be well-known to many people in this building. This is a precinct where you could have some really good services for veterans. Legacy is interested in negotiating with the government for the use of the hall, so I call on the government to actually take the step of dealing with this. It needs to be remediated and then it needs to be made available for community use, and I'm sure there'll be no shortage of community organisations interested in using it. But, for the local residents and for the hospital and for all of us who are in and around Greenslopes, I do expect this to be fixed. It has been going on literally for years. I've written many letters about it to a succession of Commonwealth government ministers while I've been a member of parliament, and there's still no action. This needs to be fixed.</span>

                    </a>  Another issue I've been really concerned about is the absence of any support in the budget for the Cavendish Road level crossing. The Lytton Road level crossing was funded by the federal government last year and there is some funding in this year's budget for the Beams Road level crossing, but still nothing for the Cavendish Road level crossing. I certainly don't begrudge the Lytton Road funding from last yearâthere was a terrible fatality at the Lytton Road level crossing; I know the member for Bonner was very upset and devastated by that, and of course he advocated for that funding. But, similarly, the Cavendish Road level crossing is something that is crying out for fixing up. It shouldn't ever take a fatality for funding for that particular level crossing to be addressed. This is something that people have been talking to me about for the entire time that I've been a member of the federal parliamentâand beforeâand it's something that really needs to be resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the most salient issue on the minds of my constituents right now is the COVID pandemic and the consequent issues that people are facing when it comes to their health. Of course, the twin issue is the current recession that we're facing at the moment as a nation. One of the really key issues for my constituents, when they look at this budget, is thinking about whether or not the decisions taken by the Morrison government in this budget are going to potentially make the recession longer and deeper than it otherwise would have been. What do I mean by that? Of course, I'm talking about decisions that might lead to support being withdrawn from the economy too early. We would all be aware in this place that if support is withdrawn too early that can lead to a deeper and longer recession.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's expected that more than 27,000 workers in my local area could be worse off and more than $24 million could be taken out of the local economy because of the cuts to JobKeeper. As you would know, Deputy Speaker Rick Wilson, withdrawal of that sort of support just makes no sense if there's no comprehensive jobs plan to replace it; that's certainly been the case with this budget. In addition, we're very concerned that, under the Prime Minister's changes, Australians on the minimum wageâthat includes people in my electorateâcould also lose up to $300 a week from their pay packets, even if their employer has recovered enough to come off JobKeeper. The wage subsidy is really important. It's crucial for keeping people connected to the labour market. Anything that can be done to make sure that people remain in work should be considered. On the new wage subsidy and the hiring credit that was announced: I am disappointed that almost one million Australians who are unemployed are excluded from the eligibility for that new hiring credit as well. That is, I think, very disappointing for Australians who are looking to the government for support during these very difficult times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronavirus pandemic has seen the number of locals relying on unemployment payments in my electorate increase from 3,947 in December last year to more than 9,800 as at August this year; that's up by more than 5,800 people, or up by around 249 per cent. Across the country, the number of unemployed people looking for work has skyrocketed; it has doubled since the start of the pandemic. My community is being hit really hard by these things. We saw, when lockdown started, massive queues at the Centrelinks. I've given a shout-out to my Centrelink frontline workers before, but let me give them another shout-out and say: thank you, again, for all the work that you've done to look after people during these terrible times. Heading into Christmas, a lot of people are incredibly anxious about what the future might hold. So let me just say once more, to be clear: the Prime Minister must make sure that support is not withdrawn too quickly or too early. If he does allow support to be withdrawn too quickly or too early, that will deepen the recession and make it longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that's of key importance to my local area is child care. Our local suburbs' families have seen costs rise by 4.6 per cent in a year. In that time, CPI has gone up by only 2.2 per cent. With childcare subsidies indexed to CPI, you can see the trouble that we have. People are being left more and more out of pocket because of the increasing costs of child care. As you would know, Deputy Speaker Rick Wilson, nationally childcare fees have increased by 35.9 per cent since the Liberal-National government was first elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last sitting week, in the budget reply, the Leader of the Labor Party, Anthony Albanese, announced Labor's working family childcare boost, which would bring immediate fee relief to 97 per cent of families. We will also task the ACCC to design a price regulation mechanism to shed some light on costs and fees and drive them down for good, and get the Productivity Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the sector with the aim of implementing a universal 90 per cent subsidy for all familiesâincredibly important. Child care, and the absence of accessible child care, is a key impediment to people returning to work after they've had kids. Of course, we also know that child care is incredibly important for early learningâearly childhood development being crucial to people's outcomes throughout their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to mention another issue that's of importance to my constituents, and that is aircraft noise. Throughout my time as a federal MP, I've been calling on the government, on BAC and on Airservices to mitigate noise for people living under the flightpath. Those people, I should say, include me. I've lived under the flightpath for a long time, and this is an issue that I, therefore, know very well. So many of our locals who live under the flightpath have been calling for a decrease to noise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happened very recently is that the second runway has been openedâa really big milestone in the life of Brisbane Airport Corporation. The second runway was opened in July this year. So there's now a second cohort of people in my electorate who are affected by aircraft noise. They have been very concerned about that aircraft noise. In fact, the local state member, the Hon. Di Farmer MP, the local councillor, Councillor Kara Cook and I have been getting so many inquiries that we have started a petition to call on the Deputy Prime Minister, as the minister responsible, to explain in really clear language, in a consolidated way, what the options might be for decreasing that noise. More than 1,600 people have signed that petition already, and, of those, more than 1,000 are actually constituents of ours in our collective electorates. So I will be calling on the Deputy Prime Minister to assist with that. Of course, the area being what it is, there are actually quite a few people who live there who've got aviation expertise. I don't claim to have any aviation expertise, but pilots and people who've got air traffic control experience have all been coming forward with lots of suggestions and ideas. So we are compiling those for the Deputy Prime Minister to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue of crucial importance across my electorate is jobs and job creation. In his budget reply speech, the Leader of the Labor Party, Anthony Albanese, flagged a number of proposals that could assist with jobs, including through supporting construction, maintenance and manufacturing jobs. The government should actually adopt Labor's proposals. One of the early ones that they could adopt would be Anthony's suggestion in relation to funding repairs to social housing. Labor would invest $500 million to fast-track urgent repairs to social housing and call on the states to match the funding. Repairs could start almost immediatelyâpretty much right away. That would mean jobs for chippies, for sparkies and for plumbers. It would mean jobs for manufacturers of components of building supplies and materials. This is a no-brainer. It's something that needs to be done, and it could be done right away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the other issue that Anthony talked about that is absolutely fundamental to jobs creation, because it's fundamental to backing in Australian industry, was energy policy. Labor would modernise and rebuild our electricity grid to drive more jobs, drive cheaper power prices and provide the reliable energy that our country needs to drive industry. We should actually be a renewable energy superpower, but our transmission system isn't up to scratchâand that needs to be fixed. Meanwhile, the Liberal-National government have had 22 different energy policies in the time that they've been in power. So, clearly, they can't be counted on to deliver on this. But it's a really important issue and it needs a resolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue of great frustration for my constituents is the NBN. The Liberals never should have trashed Labor's NBN plans. It was obviouslyâand it was obvious at the timeâsilly to replace the fibre plans with a copper rollout. They finally admitted it, but only after seven years of waste. The fibre-to-the-premises model was the right model. But now the government's going to spend $4.5 billion in public money cleaning up this ridiculous mistake. Of course, this needs to happen as promptly as possible. Whenever there are internet problems at my house, there's always a bit of muttering about the Liberal government and what they did to the NBN. I'm sure that that is being replicated across household after household on the south side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to make some brief remarks about my shadow environment portfolio. We are now seeing the ramifications of the fact that the Liberals cut 40 per cent of the funding to the environment department since they were elected. Those ramifications are playing out in delays in project approvals under the EPBC Act. A couple of months ago, the Auditor-General's report came out and said that there are extensive delays to approvals. There's been a 510 per cent increase in delays for approval decisions under this government. What do you expect? If you cut funding to the environment department, the consequences are a delay on jobs and a delay on investments, because of the delay on project approvals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we shouldn't be rushing project approvals through. They absolutely must be done properly. This is not about cutting corners or waving things through that would have environmental impacts. This is actually just about meeting statutory time frames by resourcing the department properly. I was pleased to see that the government has issued a bit of a mea culpa on this by admitting its cuts are at the root of these problems, the admission taking the form of some additional money for the EPBC decision-making by the department. But the government never should have cut the funding in the first place, and every delayed project that was delayed because of workload problems or mismanagement in the department, rather than for genuine environmental reasons, is a consequence of this government's mismanagement and cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the environment more broadly, the hallmark of this government has been that it is a government of announcements but without delivery. We've seen that in a number of places. For example, there was the remarkable situation recently with the statutory review of the EPBC legislation, where the government announced that they would not bring forward legislation without at the same time bringing forward some proposed national environmental standards. What happened? They brought forward legislation in the August sittings but no national environmental standards. So we are looking very much forward to seeing what they do in relation to the recommendations from the review for national environmental standards as well as a range of other recommendations from that review process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to threatened species: this is absolutely crucial. Less than 40 per cent of listed threatened species have a recovery plan. Environment officials have told Senate estimates that there are 172 species and habitats that required a plan, and most of those plans are overdue. In fact, they haven't made a new plan since June 2019. Quite a bit has happened in the intervening period, including a national bushfire crisis that saw three billion animals killed or displaced. It is absolutely crucial that this government gets its act together, gets a plan for addressing the backlog and works hard on considering all those species that the Threatened Species Scientific Committee is saying need to be considered for listing or uplisting as a consequence of the bushfires. They just need to get their act together. The world is facing an extinction crisis, and Australia leads the world in mammal extinctions. It's not good enough to not be doing a good job when it comes to threatened species in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say something about water. I visited Emu Swamp Dam site last week. This is actually the only dam that the government have been able to point to. Before they got elected, they said they were going to build 100 dams. They have built zero dams. They're now in their eighth year. Finally there's a dam that they can point to. Finally there's some federal funding going into a dam. They've been having a go at us, I noticed, about their theory that Labor are somehow not properly supportive of this dam. What we found out in Stanthorpe last week was that actually they only sent the paperwork to the Queensland government in September this year. It took them more than a year to get their act together to send the paperwork through. Thankfully the Queensland government have turned it around, and I congratulate them for doing it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I think I might continue where the former speaker left off and say that the Labor Party are absolutely hopeless at dams. The first thing that I did when I got back to New England was to do with the extension of Chaffey Dam, which was completely bogged down in environmental tape. We had to have offsets for the booroolong frog. I always thought that frogs live in water, and a bigger dam would make a happier frog, but apparently not. We couldn't get anywhere with it. They didn't have enough money, and, by their own forms of regulation, they had stopped the dam. And that's precisely what they want to do. So we moved the regulations to the side, got further money, put another 40,000 megalitres of capacity into that damn and, by our so doing, the city of Tamworth did not run out of water in the last drought. Otherwise, it would have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the difference between the Labor Party and the coalition, where so many of us have actually been in business. I still have a businessâI was harvesting on the weekend. I was an accountant. I had my own practice, and therefore not only did I have my own business but my job was oversight of so many others. With the Labor Party, I always think their economics is a bit like dada-surrealism. It's disorder and obscurity. It's a sort of enigmatic working of the subconscious, a dictation by thought and an absence of any control exercised by reason. I always think it's pure psychic automatism. That's what you get with the Labor Party. You can see it now: the juxtaposition of a tirade about new environmental requirements and a subsequent statement of, 'We still believe in dams.' I listened to the budget-in-reply speech. They didn't mention one. I don't know which dam they're going to build. We're having a crack at building Rookwood. They don't want to do that. Paradise Damâthey're going to reduce it by a third. It's hardly a case of them falling over themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great instance at the moment, where the LNP have actually done something I'm so happy about. They've taken the first steps towards the Bradfield Scheme. The only way we're going to fix the water situation in the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin is to find a new source of water. It doesn't matter how many times you cut and dice it: you can't make water appear from nowhere. You have to find a new source and bring it in. This move by the LNP in Queensland should be at the front line of their political joust as they go into this election, and they should challenge the Labor Party on exactly what they are going to do to match it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, currently the Labor Party have Ross Garnaut on their committee. Well, good luck with that one! I don't think he's going to be recommending a dam. Then they have, I think, Professor Dale from James Cook University. Remember him? James Cook University is the one that kicked out Peter Ridd because he dared to dissent from their zeitgeist, so I don't think you're going to get a recommendation for a dam out of them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to the coalition, I'm very happy that Frasers transportâyou see their trucks moving aroundâgets a 100 per cent write-off. New trucks mean new truck drivers. Nolan'sânew trucks, new truck drivers. There will be new prime movers for Carey's, McDonald's and even single operators like Dugald Geddes in my area. A new truck means a new operator. It means a new driver. It means an expansion in the economy. Whether scrapers or dozers or cranes, this 100 per cent write-off is going to be instrumental in driving an economy forward by finding the peopleâbecause you can only get a tax write-off if you're making a profit. The business that is making a profit is the one you want to stimulate to grow so that they employ more people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of infrastructure, what we have on both sides is a form of Keynesian stimulusâan attempt to increase aggregate demand. Yes, it works, but it's best if it works with a legacy component and the highest possible multiplier that you can get. Infrastructure is good at that, because you've got the initial stimulus of the people working on it and you've got the legacy of what's left after it. One of the great things that drives economies forward are roads. Cities don't build roads; roads build cities. Roads are instrumental in the growth of the economy. Dams are absolutely fundamental. Water is wealth, and a dam is a bank. If you don't have proper water infrastructure, the capacity of an economy to grow has a ceiling on it. If you are involved in industryâand I have beenâthe first questions people ask about is the price of power, access to labour and access to water. If you don't have access to water, you just can't do it, because it's a fundamental input into business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some local infrastructure that I think is vitally important in my areaâDungowan Dam. The federal government has now placed a quarter of a billion dollars towards Dungowan Dam. That's a huge, huge win. Once more, it underpins the economic growth of the blue-collar workforce, which is very strong in the city of Tamworth. Taminda, Glen Artney, the intermodalâthese are all parts of the expansion of the blue-collar workforce in Tamworth, and they're a key part of my constituency and probably one of the reasons I have maybe a different perspective on the way I approach politics to others. It's because it is a blue-collar workforce, and we're well-supported by them. We have also started towards Mole River dam in the north, and it's vitally important that that goes ahead. A major piece of infrastructure, which the Commonwealth has put a million dollars towards for its feasibility study, is the Oven Mountain pumped hydro. This would be a $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion project. I support pumped hydro because, to be quite frank, I have concerns about wind and solar, which are not dispatchable power. To shore it up into dispatchable power, you must be honest and find the mechanism that turns it into dispatchable power, and pump hydro does that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side, of course, once you add pump hydro to a windmill, the cost of that power is beyond that of coal. Apparently this is one of the things that both sides can't talk about. It is the truth that established coal infrastructure is a cheaper form of power. It is overwhelmingly still our power. We should be developing the most efficient form of coal-fired power delivery in the world because we still stand behind the fact that our nation's biggest export is fossil fuels. It just is. It's denying the simple economics of how our nation works to say, 'We won't live with gas and we won't live with coal, but we somehow will magically live with all the services that we want at this current point.' You've got to pay for them; therefore, you have to understand the basic economics of how your nation works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have other issues. Inland Rail is going to be vitally important. Did you know that the pipes for the Inland Rail are made in Tamworth by Humes? Therefore, the economic stimulus of that project goes way beyond the rail corridor. One of the proudest moments was when I got the money for the Inland Rail. I remember conversations with then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and finance minister Mathias Cormann, because it was a key component of the coalition agreement. For years before the leaders on our side spoke about it, tilted towards it and promised it, but they just never got it. That was the point. We had to drive a deal, and we got it. Now they're building it. I and my colleagues in the National Party will take that as one of our greatest achievements. I'm happy about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some concerns about where our debt is. I understand the Labor Party's attack saying, 'Liberal debt,' but the problem though is that the Labor Party want more debt. They want universal child care, an extension of JobKeeper, an extension of JobSeeker and more money for public housing. These are all noble causes, but you have to borrow further for it, and we're at $1.7 trillion. There's this myth that you never have to repay money. People don't give it to you and say: 'Don't worry about this, Charlie Chaplin. We never want it back.' They actually do want it back, and you have to have the capacity to pay it back. Any mother who has run a budget and any person who has seen a credit card understands the concerns I have with debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some suggestions of quantitative easing. Let's just go through that. It has been a fascination of mine. Did you know that at the start of the hyperinflation period in Germany there were 170 marks to the dollar? At the end it wasâand wait for thisâ87 trillion marks to the dollar. You might just think that that's a peculiarity of the time, but, no, Argentina had similar circumstances, but not to that extent. Even back in Roman times, in antiquity, near the collapse of the Roman Empire the denarius was about one-fiftieth of its value at the start. You have to be careful. Your fiat currency is sacred. It's merely paper. There has to be strength in the economy behind that. You can't glibly say that it's not important.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this appropriation debate I want to state that you have to understand the fundamentals of your economy. Fossil fuels are your biggest export. Then it's iron ore. Then there is daylight, daylight, daylight and more daylight, then education and then agriculture. If you lose your big ones and think that it's politically incorrect to talk about your big ones, then you're not going to have an economy and you're going to have very little to manage. Everything around here is importedâthe clothes you wear, these glasses, the phone, the electronics and the lights. Find me something nowadays that's not imported. Therefore, if you're living with everything that is importedâand they're not sending it to you out of charityâyou have to be putting something on the boat and sending it in the other direction, otherwise you just don't get it. What do we put on a boat and send in the other direction? Gas, coal, iron ore, rare earths, bauxite, beef, horticultural products and cotton. Yet, according to the previous member, so many of these things have become politically incorrect, which means that you are naive to the economics of how your own economy works.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to go through a couple of the things that I think are really important. I'd like to see, in the future, some further vision. We only have two sealed roads across our nation. I reckon that's pretty poor after about 250 years. We should be sealing the third one. We've started. We got $100 million years ago to start the Laverton-Boulia Road. We should be finishing that off and getting it sealed because that opens up the gold precincts around Laverton and gives us more access to money. The Toowoomba-to-Gladstone rail corridor should be built so it attaches to the Inland Rail. We should be building new power stations, new coal-fired power stationsâthe most efficient in the world. We should be changing tack and looking at nuclear. We just seem to have bogged down in the 1980s. We should be brave enough to say, 'We've moved on.' If they've got pebble-bed reactors from new energy in the United States that basically are unable to melt down because of the mechanism from which they're constructed, we should be looking at it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am supportive of in our budget is the new money for mobile phone black spots. That is incredibly important in regional areas. There's the move towards decentralisation, with $41 million towards that, but we should be nominating the sections of the departments that are going to go, and the inspiration for that should always be at the federal level and having the bravery to say, 'This section of this department is going to go to this regional town,' like we did with APVMA to Armidale, AFMA to Coffs Harbour, part of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority down to Wodonga and part of the GRDC to Toowoomba. So many of these things are vitally important. With Stronger Communities, we get $150,000 per electorate. It works so well. There are so many small organisations that benefit, such as Men's Sheds; even fixing the roofs on local community churchesâthings that would never get done without the money that we have from that $150,000 allocation from Stronger Communities. It is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is obviously a Keynesian stimulus budget. I hope it does that job. Ultimately, we're going to have to have an honest discussion about how we bring the debt into a position where we can start to repay it or at least hold it where it is, and that's whether we're in government or whether the other side is in government. It's going to be your problem if it's not ours, and we should have a discussion about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll close with this. The bushfires were caused by fuel load. I know; I was fighting them. Yes, of course, you have issues pertinent to the climate, but to say that somehow our actions in Australia caused the bushfires is ridiculous and a bit of an insult. The bushfires were caused by an excessive fuel load, by lack of access with regard to fighting fires and a lack of capacity to get access to such things as water. They're the things that caused the bushfires. I know because we had one at our place.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I acknowledge the member for New England's contribution. They're never boring! I'll move on. The budget funds the National Disability Insurance Scheme for another year. Mind you, it does so after ripping $4.6 billion out of the scheme last year and calling it an 'underspend'. Last year, the government ripped $4.6 billion out of the NDIS to prop up a budget surplus that never eventuated. In this year's budget, they've kindly returned only $1.5 billion of what they took. But I acknowledge the scheme is funded for another year, and this is a good thing for Australians with disability and those who love and care for them. That the NDIS is funded for the year is a small mercy that we have to celebrate, with a seven-year Liberal government. Despite what the Liberal government's comments are publicly, I think that, corporately, they are ambivalent about the national disability safety net and, at worst, many of them have a secret view that it is too expensive. You always have to wonder with the current government. When they seek to change something about the NDIS, you wonder: 'Who are they changing it for? What's really driving the agenda?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I want to talk about the government's most recent changes to the way that Australians with disability will now get onto the national scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has recently moved to introduce a process called 'independent assessments' to the National Disability Insurance Scheme from 2021. This is a change from the system where a person with profound disability would seek to prove their eligibility for funding under the NDIS using expert reports from their treating doctors and the allied health professionals that they and their families have been dealing with. And where successful, based upon the evidence of treating medical experts and the people who work around them, the NDIA would approve their entry to the scheme. And there are 430,000 people now on this remarkable scheme. It would be a change though, this government's proposing, whereby they now seek to use a private national panel commissioned by the government that would see all existing participants and all applicants on the scheme and this independent panel would assess them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the government, the basis for this changeâmoving from the participant providing reports and evidence to an independent assessment processâis that it is a response to the 2019 review into the operation of the NDIS by David Tune, the former secretary of Finance, a respected public servant. Mr Tune's review is now known as the Tune review. The Tune review made a single carefully qualified recommendation regarding independent assessments. It said that we should have independent assessments following the completion of pilot programs to be introduced through amendments to the NDIS legislation. However, of the two pilot programs which were scheduled, the first one was limited to a small number of people; it didn't consider all disability types; and it didn't sufficiently consider culturally and linguistically diverse people, people from Indigenous communities or people with highly complex needs. And this pilot program was discontinued halfway through this year. This is right. So the process upon which the move to independent assessments was to be justified hasn't been completed. We don't know one way or the other whether or not the two pilot programs in their entirety were a raging success, an unmitigated failure or, indeed, just insufficient. But the government in the meantime, even though it hasn't completed the two pilot programs, has announced the new direction. We presumed that when Mr Tune said there would be a pilot program before the full change was brought in nationally that was what was meant to be the case. We presumed that he meant it would be a completed pilot, not an abandoned one. The government's response to the Tune review cited independent assessments as a solution to no less than four of the Tune recommendationsâhe made several recommendations. It has announced that independent assessments become mandatory for all disability types at both access decisions and plan reviews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has claimed that the original Productivity Commission report supports the introduction of this new system of independent assessments. However, they have been unable to adequately explain why the government has waited seven years from the Productivity Commission report or why assessments were not included back then. The absence of proper evidence to support the introduction of these significant changes to over 400,000 participants and their families on the NDIS is unacceptable. It has infuriated the Australian disability community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, over recent weeks and months, has heard from many peopleâmany people with disabilities and their carers, and from service providers and their representative organisationsâthat the government hasn't adequately consulted them before it's decided to introduce the independent assessment process. We believe in Labor that this contravenes the principle of the NDIS Participant Service Guarantee that the NDIS be transparent, which the NDIA has said has been in place since July this year. You can't be transparent if you don't provide all the information or complete the pilot process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many NDIS participants are fearful that independent assessments are yet another standardisation scheme from the government that inflicted the unlawful robodebt program on more than 700,000 unsuspecting, innocent Australians. Labor shares concern that independent assessments are another way for the Liberals to simply take support away from disabled Australians by unfairly restricting access to the scheme and to limit plan funding. I say to the government, having spoken with people with disability, having spoken to their representatives and their carers, that the independent assessment process is causing more fear and more concern than should be the case if the government simply adhered to better implementation processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the Tune review recommendations and agrees that there needs to be an approach that delivers more consistency and fairness in the NDIS. It is unfair that people who are unable to afford reports for an occupational therapist or an allied health professional should have to wait years on public waiting lists. We accept the principle that there needs to be equity in outcomes for NDIS participants. In other words, people with identical physical conditions shouldn't receive radically different funding packages without proper investigation. Consistency is a principle of equity. But the potential for the solution to these problems is being undermined by the way that the minister and the government are implementing independent assessments without proper process. We don't think that they shouldn't empanel a system of independent assessments, but they shouldn't do so until they've overcome the grave concerns of the disability community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why Labor won't support the policy changes until the government has met at least the following conditions: first, the government should listen to participants and immediately pause the rollout of the current independent assessments program. If you do the process right the first time then you won't need to come back again and again, and it won't cause anxiety in the manner in which it is now doing. Second, there needs to be a genuine transparent consultation process to confirm what the issues are and trial different options. Not all people with disabilities come in the same size and shape. Third, they need to co-design a solution best supported by evidence with participants, families, carers and the sector. And fourth, as a minimum, they should make public all modelling, all actuarial advice and evaluation reports used to support the chosen process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government have ignored the Tune recommendations to put the changes which they're introducing into legislation, so there's no opportunity for the parliament to properly scrutinise and, indeed, amend or improve the independent assessment process. This undermines the role of the parliament, and I know there are many individual Liberal and National MPs who are equally motivated to make sure that people with disability get a fair go, but I put them on notice: I spent 10 years working with people with disabilities on creating the NDIS and it would be far better to respect the role of government backbenches and the opposition as legislators as opposed to rubber stamps. The government won't put the changes through parliament, through legislation, so it becomes incumbent to have a public debate, denying the role of legislators of all political stripe to have their say and reflect the views of the community. I've written to the minister for the NDIS, Mr Stuart Robert, outlining Labor's opposition to the independent assessments in the current process. I will continue to draw attention to the matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is a vital national scheme, but under this seven-year-old government it's been implemented in an ad hoc manner, which is jeopardising the scheme's aims of providing greater independence and quality of life for Australians with disability. There are many success stories with the NDIS, but there are many people complaining about the NDIS. We hear cases every day. I'll just share a couple. NDIS participant Wendy waited five years for home modifications that left her unsafe and tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket because the NDIS picked a dodgy builder, the lowest-cost builder. There's Indiana, who is eight. She's intellectually delayed, and she has aggressive epilepsy. Her single mum, Meghan, wants NDIS funding for an assistance animal, an animal that can help predict and work with Indi's seizures. It's a cheaper option than 24-hour, seven-days-a-week monitoring care and more accurate than any other available technology, according to the family, but the NDIA refuses to look at the assistance animal. Now, mum, Meghan, is forced to fight the decision at the AAT, while Indiana is in hospital for brain surgery. There is Kim, who, due to having shortfalls in her supported independent living funding, is having her insulin injected by a support worker, not a registered nurse, and who has ended up in hospital due to complications with her diabetes. There's Matthew, who's been waiting for over a year for custom-built specialist disability accommodation housing. At the last minute, the NDIA have withdrawn his approved supported independent living package and tried to force a lower care model on him, despite his high-support needs. If he doesn't accept, he won't be able to move in and he'll have nowhere to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we're at an important moment in this country for disability. I think there is political consensus about the role of the NDIS, which is a significant development in our social safety net. It's about empowering individuals living with profound or severe disability and giving them choice and control over their lives. It is a significant accomplishment. Without the outbreak of COVID related Keynesian of the born-again big government champions of social security, other Labor achievements are always at risk from our conservative governments. But the NDIS I think is one which doesn't need to be changed at an election. I think it is one that can be worked on with goodwill between the government and opposition now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I genuinely believe that the government would be well advised to put a pause on the independent assessments process, not because the principle is all bad, because it's not. Equity and consistency in decision-making are important. But, when people with a disability have got a glimpse of home with an NDIS package, there's genuine fear and anxiety the independent assessment will override or trump the reports of treating allied health professionals. How in an hour or two can someone make an assessment about someone's adult child with autism and not as a starting point accept the reports of the treating allied health professionals and understand the family and the organisations providing care?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a situation where people are now nervous, people are scared, people are anxious. There are 430,000 participants. Many of them are asking themselves, as they become aware of the changes to the independent assessment process: 'Is this just an attempt to reduce my funding?' In the case of some people, their funding may go up. But there is no doubt that there will be losers out of this scheme. The government agency has said as muchâthere will be losers in this scheme. The point about it is that the government has already said that some people will go backwards. But, to go backwards on a process where people with disabilities voices haven't been heard, is an avoidable mistake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes in politics there are some arguments that aren't avoidable. You can have arguments about industrial relations, you can have arguments about refugees and you can have arguments about the climate. But, on the NDIS, the government is making an avoidable decision to have an argument with participants in the scheme. There is nothingâthere is no electoral stop clockâthat says that independent assessments have to be resolved by a certain day and rolled out. Many other things in the NDIS have taken a lot longer. All I advise the government is hasten slowly. Put the evidence out there, complete the pilot programs and consult people with disability. Let the joint select committee, made up of Liberal, National and Labor MPs, do their job as legislators. It is time to say to the executive of government: respect the legislators, respect the everyday experience of MPs from all sides of the people they see in their office. Let's put people with disabilities, their carers and the people who support them every day first. Let's put them first and let's not cause needless anxiety.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  My electorate of Mallee has had a unique experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the only electorate in Victoria that borders two states. Not only has Mallee endured some of the strictest lockdowns seen anywhere in the world, we have also been barred from our two neighbouring states, despite our extremely low case numbers. Taken together, these two elements have caused huge strains on families, businesses, communities and our economy and we'll have untold impacts for years to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison-McCormack government's economic response to the pandemic has kept hope and businesses alive. The JobKeeper payment has supported 4,300 businesses in Mallee. The cash flow boost has assisted around 6,300 small and medium businesses. Over 10,000 individuals in Mallee have received the JobSeeker coronavirus supplement, and 23,700 aged pensioners in Mallee received support payments of $750 in April and July, and will receive two further $250 payments in December and again in March. This has provided the people of Mallee with hope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 Commonwealth budget is a way forward out of this crisis and a return to life as we once knew. Whether it's by putting money back into the pockets of hard-working Australians, encouraging investment and growth in small and medium to large businesses, supporting businesses to bring on new employees and apprentices, or providing for the health and wellbeing of our nation, this budget is working for all Australians as we look towards economic recovery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax relief measures for individuals will provide confidence for families and much-needed stimulus for local businesses and the economy. Around 61,100 taxpayers in Mallee, or over 40 per cent of Mallee's entire population, will benefit from tax relief of up to $2,745 this year. This measure will put money into people's pockets at a time when it's desperately needed. I encourage those who can afford it to spend a little more in the coming months and to shop local. Local businesses need our support now more than ever before, and this government understands that. That's why the tax relief measures for business in this budget are so important. I know that many small and large businesses in my electorate have taken advantage of the instant asset write-off scheme. Rod Stuart from the Dunolly Bakery told me that he was able to use the write-off scheme to purchase new mixers, ovens and a bread slicer. The purchase of the new equipment helped to dispel the uncertainty surrounding coronavirus, giving his staff a huge morale boost. It showed staff and customers that things were still moving in the right direction. The new equipment has led to greater efficiencies for the business, leading to huge takings in September despite the lack of travellers from Melbourne. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that the scheme has been expanded to include over 99 per cent of businesses and the full value of any eligible asset, small and large businesses will continue to benefit and grow. The instant asset write-off provisions will unlock investment, expand the productive capacity of the nation and create tens of thousands of jobs across the country. Purchasing new equipment helps businesses increase efficiency and productivity. Small businesses will buy, sell, deliver, install, and service these purchases, stimulating the economy. It will also be hugely helpful for farmers in Mallee, who will be able to purchase new equipment, whether it's a new truck, tractor or harvester. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently spoke to Damien Matthews of GTS Freight, a trucking and transport company based in Mildura that has grown into one of the largest wine and beverage distributors nationwide. GTS Freight is backed by an ever-growing fleet of vehicles and has long-term plans for expansion. Damien told me that he plans to bring forward five years worth of purchases and upgrades of trucks and trailers in the next two years to take advantage of the instant asset write-off scheme. This will mean millions of dollars of accelerated investment and associated economic activity, and it will mean job creation in industries up and down the supply chain. This is just one business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing local industry is instrumental to our nation's economic recovery, and this government knows that apprentices are vital to industry. Giving Australians the skills they need and getting them into a job will lift us out of this recession. Businesses in Mallee who take on apprentices are now eligible for a 50 per cent wage subsidy to help bring on new employees and free up money to cover other costs or make new investments. This measure supports local tradies looking to bring on a new apprentice, and it will also assist bigger businesses like True Foods in Maryborough and Entegra Signature Structures in Swan Hill. Overall, it supports Australian businesses to employ 100,000 new apprentices and trainees. Apprenticeships and traineeships for young people ensure that there are skills in the pipeline to meet the future needs of employers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $1.2 billion boosting apprenticeship commencements wage subsidy will feed into other planks of the government's economic recovery plan, including the Modern Manufacturing Strategy and the Technology Investment Roadmap for our energy sector. After having visited many manufacturing businesses across Mallee, including Polymaster, Pumpa Engineering, Global Rotomoulding, Nu-Edge Solutions and many more, I am very excited about the Modern Manufacturing Strategy and for Mallee's prospects to become a leader in 21st-century manufacturing and innovation. I know the $52.8 million for round 2 of the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund is also welcomed by businesses in Mallee. This is an important opportunity for Kooka's Country Cookies, in Donald, to apply for funding for their new factory and production line, which will help meet demand for their products.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 Commonwealth budget has displayed the Morrison-McCormack government's commitment to regional infrastructure and, in turn, job creation and economic development in regional Australia. Local councils in my electorate were elated by the initial Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program funding announced at the height of the pandemic. The $1 billion extension of the program announced in this budget will help councils to prioritise key projects while creating jobs and stimulating economic activity. The 12 local government areas in Mallee received almost $19 million in the first round and will receive another $17 million in the extension. Northern Grampians shire is using part of its money to fund a streetscape and town centre rehabilitation project in St Arnaud, while Gannawarra Shire Council will allocate some of its funding to the Murrabit Stormwater Project. These are shovel-ready projects that will assist the economic recovery of our region and create jobs for locals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office I've made a point of keeping in close contact with the leaders of each of the 12 shires in my electorate. The CEOs and mayors of each shire have made it plain to me just how important the Roads to Recovery and Financial Assistance Grant programs are to their running. For many of the small regional councils, maintaining and upgrading roads is a major expense. That's why I'm glad this budget includes an additional $400 million to support the extension of the Roads to Recovery Program by an additional year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I'm also excited for round 5 of the Building Better Regions Fund, which has been hugely successful for key projects in Mallee. In round 4 of the program Mallee secured funding for Woodbine's specialised disability support accommodation, the Birchip streetscape project, upgrades to the Ouyen Livestock Exchange and many other important projects. With half of the $200 million of round 5 allocated for tourism related projects, I hope to see the Mildura Rural City Council reapply for their additional riverfront development project along the Murray River. Infrastructure remains hugely important to the Morrison-McCormack government, and I'm ecstatic that the Albacutya Bridge was funded through the Bridges Renewal Program this year. I will now be directing my efforts to secure funding for the Davis Park grandstand in Nhill for the people of the Hindmarsh shire.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my very first speech to parliament in August 2019 I spoke of the need for greater access to quality health care. I said a person's postcode should not determine their health status. Since then I have been fighting for health in Mallee, and the 2020 Commonwealth budget has delivered with an $18.6 million program for border oncology research which funds the Mildura Base Public Hospital as a new site for the regional trials network in Victoria. This project will help bridge the metro regional clinical trials gaps by 2025, with the bonus of attracting more specialists into our region. Having research done in clinical trials means people gain access to better treatments. This funding will help put local researchers and doctors at the forefront of global research and will lead to more treatment options for regional patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out of this year's budget, the Mildura Base Public Hospital will also benefit from the coalition government's commitment of $133.6 billion over five years to fund public hospitals in Australia. This is an increase of $33.6 billion on the previous agreement with states and territories, and it's a huge win for hospitals. My expectation is that the state government will allocate funding for the Swan Hill hospital and the Mildura hospital to address the needs of these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic continues to weigh on the mental health of our communities. That's why I'm so glad that mental health and suicide prevention continues to be a national priority. Medicare funded psychological services through the Better Access initiative have been doubled, meaning that patients can now access 20 sessions instead of just 10 under this budget. And more funding is being provided for Lifeline, headspace, Beyond Blue and Kids Helpline. These and other initiatives bring the coalition government's commitment to mental health support to $5.7 billion this year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mallee has had a unique experience of the pandemic, and I have firsthand knowledge about how the restrictions on the people in the Mallee have affected the wellbeing of our communities. I recently sent an electorate-wide email to check in on Mallee locals and request their feedback, to which I received over 700 responses, which I read and responded to individually. Only 14 per cent of people supported the restrictions, while 53 per cent opposed them. Almost 200 responses expressed significant concerns about the economy, and the mental health and wellbeing of their community. There were also 129 responses that mentioned words like depression, suicide and anxiety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from Lisa from Mildura, whose daughter's partner tragically lost his life in a motorbike accident in June in Brisbane. Lisa was not able to travel to Queensland to be with her daughter, despite her willingness to quarantine. She said the ongoing mental and emotional impact is something that will haunt her forever. Allaya from Amphitheatre told me she feels isolated. She feels that she and her family are not important, and that people who have lost everything and who can't see their loved ones have been forgotten. I've also heard from David from Murrayville, who has been running the Cobb &amp; Co Cafe for the past 10 years. His business is nearing closure because of the 80 per cent downturn due to border closures and hospitality restrictions. He supported the South Australian economy by purchasing produce for his store from that state for the past 10 years, but has now been locked out by the South Australian government. On top of this, David can't get to Adelaide for medical appointments. These are just a few of the hundreds of heart-wrenching stories I've heard in the past few months. Some I have had the privilege to assist, but certainly have created no miracles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 Commonwealth budget has outlined a path to recovery for Australia through job creation, infrastructure expenditure and tax relief. But Victoria's social and economic recovery cannot truly begin until freedom of movement across state borders is entirely free, and coronavirus restrictions reflect the reality of case numbers in regional areas. The budget contains many important measures that will continue to support individuals and businesses across the country, but the federal government can't provide everything that Victorians need right now. What they need is their freedom back, and they need that urgently.</span>

                    <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  This is Australia's first recession in 30 years. The Morrison recession is the second recession in my lifetime. Nearly one million Australians are unemployed, and the government expects another 160,000 Australians to be unemployed by Christmas. In September alone, 30,000 jobs were lost. The unemployment rate is rising to 6.9 per cent, and we don't know how far it will go. There are some 2.5 million Australians who are looking for work or looking for more work, and a new report from Deloitte Access Economics expects Australia's unemployment rate to get as high as 8.6 per cent in the June quarter of 2021. And yet many unemployed Australians face, at the end of this year, the Christmas present of their JobSeeker payments snapping back to just $40 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Morrison recession has hurt those in insecure work the most, particularly women and young people. Think about what young Australians have already lost, and what they face in 2021. Under this government, 140,000 trainee and apprenticeship positions have already been lost. Now they're making university education unaffordable for an entire generation. The cost of studying commerce and law degrees is going to increase by 28 per cent next year. From one year to the next, this government is increasing those degrees by 28 per cent. But it doesn't stop there. When it comes to humanities degrees, they are increasing in cost, in one year alone, by 113 per centâcosting as much as $14,500 a year or $60,000 over the course of a degree. This is on top of the fact that young people were forced to raid their tiny superannuation accountsâmany of them going down to zeroâjust to survive through this pandemic. We're a rich country and we're a country that's taken on a lot of debt, and we have treated young people appallingly during this pandemic. It's estimated that some $40 billion in superannuation has already been withdrawn during COVID. While we're saying to everyone, 'Go and take money out of your superannuation,' this government has managed to increase gross Commonwealth debt to $1 trillion. We've got record youth unemployment and huge dents in superannuation accounts, and young people will be saddled with paying back $1 trillion of Morrison Liberal debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the thankyou gift that we gave young people in this place this week was to increase their HECS debts massively, through one piece of legislation. Last week I met with year 12 students in my electorate to discuss the government's knowledge tax, to get their feedback. These were year 12s who were in the middle of studying for their exams, but they thought it was important to meet with me and tell me what they thought. Elizabeth told me that she felt the government were trying to coerce students into what they said were the job-ready disciplines. She has decided to ignore the government's financial coercion and instead study what it is that she's passionate about: humanities, history and anthropology. But she's worried that many students that she's studied alongside may not follow their passions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that's how we've treated arts degrees, let's talk about how we've treated the arts industry. This government has continued to punish those who have pursued a career in the arts. The arts, entertainment and events industry was one of the first to be shut down by COVID and will be one of the last to reopen. But somehow, despite the Liberal Party advocating for a deregulated labour market and advocating for more casual employmentâthe Liberal Party sometimes tell us they believe in the free contract and movement of labourâif you swapped jobs in the last 12 months, they punished you. If you'd worked as a casual, you were punished by this government. The 600,000 Australians who work in the arts and creative industriesâsome 4,663 in my electorate aloneâwere forgotten, and they have had to pay the financial consequences of being ignored by this government. The feedback I've received from organisations and individuals working in the arts and entertainment industry is that they do feel that this government has let them down and left them behind. They've been saying now for six months that we need a tailored package for the arts. We've seen small amounts. Very little of that money has actually gone out the door, and it has been a terrible way to treat our artists, who have actually helped enrich our souls in the hardest of years. They have started capturing the stories of Australia, in the middle of a recession, in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of a health crisis. They've been capturing these stories and sharing them. They've been putting on free concerts and entertaining us in many ways, many of them giving away their craft for free. I will never accept that in this year, of all years, we are treating our artists and our creative industries worse than we have in any other year since Federation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is about choices and it's about the alternative visions for this country. With the budget and the opposition's budget reply, we have started to see a choice for Australians. I believe that this government has left too many people behind, but at the same time it has managed to rack up $1 trillion of debt. It's a unique set of skills the Prime Minister has that he can forget so many peopleâso many women, so many young peopleâand still rack up that much debt. But you've got to be optimistic in the business of politics. There are ups and downs. I think we're an optimistic country, and I'm pleased that Labor has an optimistic vision for the future. Rehire our workers. Give people new jobs, supporting industries old and new. Rewire our economy. Make sure that we can actually transmit power, at the lowest possible cost, to all Australians. Recharge the workforce participation of women by doing something serious about child care. Any family you talk to about this system knows it does not work when you get to certain income points. Rebuild our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care should be one of the great economic drivers of our country. It should be the thing that allows our economy to succeed well above and beyond. It not only invests in the minds of young people; it also means that those people that we've invested in training can actually get out there and work, whether it be for four or five days. But, again, how did we treat workers in the childcare sector? The first and only sector to be kicked off JobKeeper was the childcare sectorâan industry that, by some coincidence, is made up of 97 per cent women. To have kicked the entire sector off JobKeeper after the incredibly difficult work they did, particularly in the middle of the pandemic, at the same time as ripping way free child care from millions of Australian families, was seriously one of the great policy missteps of this government. We know that affordable child care is a key driver of women's participation in the economy. The Prime Minister used to lecture us about this himself when he was responsible for this policy area in a previous portfolio. And Australia still, despite all the reforms, has some of the most expensive childcare costs in the world. Fees have gone up 35 per cent under this government alone, and in the north-east of my electorate, at Bayswater to Bassendean, some 48.6 per cent of services are charging over the cap. That is, many of the families reached the services cap by September and received no subsidy for the remainder of the year. This means that they are paying thousands of dollars more as they head to Christmasâindeed, now. Families in Bayswater and Bassendean are paying more for child care now than they were at the start of the year, because the Prime Minister and his government refused to do anything about the caps that they have imposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I received a bit of correspondence from a constituent in the member for Canning's electorate. Lana wrote to me, and this is the story of hundreds of thousands of families across Australia. Lana said, 'My young family with two kids can't afford to go to work either. Between childcare costs and train fares from Mandurah to Perth, the future looks grim for a professional young mum who may end up unemployable if she is forced to exit the workforce and stay at home. Her income doesn't even cover the costs.' Her income doesn't even cover the costsâthis is why we've got to fix the childcare subsidy. We need to increase the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent, remove the disincentive to work additional hours and help 97 per cent of families by between $600 and $2,900 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you'll indulge me, Deputy Speaker, I want to give a shout-out to all of the people who work in childcare centres in my electorate. This is a huge employing industry. I sit through question time. We heard the story of one employer who's employed two or so people, in some pre-prepared, formulaic answer from the government. I want to say a huge thankyou to all of the childcare workers and early childhood educators in the Perth electorate. I'm going to name their workplaces because I think it's important that we recognise all of these small but significant centres of early learning across each of our electorates. I'm luckyâI've got 62 of them in my electorate of Perth. There is MercyCare Early Learning in Bassendean; Wind in the Willows in Ashfield, Buggles Childcare Brookfield Place and Buggles Childcare in Cherry Court; Citiplace Child Care; Little Peoples Place in Forrest Street; Goodstart Early Learning in East Perth; Community Kids Morley Early Education Centre; Italian Australian Child Care Centre; Great Beginnings in Bayswater; Care for Kids School of Early Learning in Morley; Jellybeans Child Care Centre in Morley; Kidz Galore in Kyilla; Little Peoples Place in Monmouth Street; Amare Child Care; Leederville Early Childhood Centre; Marjorie Mann Lawley Day Care Centre; YMCA Maylands Early Learning Centre; Meela Child Care Centre; Mercy Child Day Care Bedford; Mount Lawley Child Care Centre Inc.; Mulberry Tree Mount Hawthorn; Indigo Montessori in both North Perth and Mount Hawthorn; Indigo Outside School Hours Care in North Perth; Noranda Child Care Centre; OrganiKids Childcare Centre; Perth College Kindergarten; Rossi Child Care Centre in Embleton and Morley; Ruth Landau Harp Early Learning; Salisbury Child Care Centre; Silverwood Child Care Centre; 10th Avenue Childcare in Inglewood; Sparx Early Learning Centre in Eden Hill; Eden Hill Outside School Hours Care; Wind in the Willows in Bassendean; YMCA Morley Child Care; Thriving Threes and Fun for Fours; Murdock Early Education Schools;. City West Kidz Early Learning Centre; Buttercups Childcare; Inglewood Station; Helping Hands at Hillcrest; Learning Sanctuary in Kings Square; Helping Hands in Inglewood and Helping Hands in Bayswater; Derrick Ernst Neighbourhood Centre; Smart Start in West Perth; Mama Moose; KinderPark Early Learning; Kiddies Learning Hub; Inglewood Station on Beaufort Street; The Akidamy School of Early Learning; Leaps &amp; Bounds Preschool; Bilingual By Five in the CBD; Nido Early School at QV1; North Perth School of Early Learning; Global Village Family Day Care;  Kids on Beaufort; Rightway Learning Family Day Care. That's a long list, but that's just for my electorate alone. There are 62 centres in the Perth electorate alone: This is a huge sector. It employs thousands and thousands of people, predominantly women, in my electorate alone. They are incredibly qualified and educated, and some of the most compassionate and hardworking people you'll meet in any electorate across the country. I want to say to everyone who works at every single one of those centres: thank you for everything you did in 2020. It was one of the toughest years that you've ever had to work in early childhood education, and many people here in parliament and, indeed, across the country, owe you a great debt of gratitude.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish on something important to the people of the City of Perth, which comprises just one small part of my electorate: finally, the City of Perth has an elected council again. The City of Perth has been through an incredibly rough time. I want to particularly congratulate the new lord mayor, Basil Zempilas, who is well known to people in this place. It is great to have a new lord mayor for the City of Perth. I look forward to working with Basil. I know that he is a guy who is passionate and driven. He has a vision for the city and will be pushing many things that he and I care deeply about, including a national centre of Indigenous culture and history, which is something I strongly believe should be located within the City of Perth. I also congratulate: Deputy Mayor Sandy Anghie, and councillors Di Bain, Rebecca Gordon, Catherine Lezer, Clyde Bevan, Brent Fleeton, Liam Gobbert and Viktor Ko. This is a fresh start for our city. It is an incredibly exciting time for Perth. Again, I congratulate the entire new council, and I wish them and their professional staff well.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  It would be trite to say that this has been a tough year for all Australians, but it's been particularly so for those in my electorate of Cowper. They've copped a triple whammy: they had the end of the very long drought, then severe, devastating bushfires and then the irony of devastating floodsâand then coronavirusâall in the space of four months. On behalf of the federal government, we were handing out federal support packages for all four situations: drought, fires, floods and coronavirus. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank all the people in Cowper and, in fact, all the people across Australia, for what they have done for each other. During the drought, we saw Australians donate to get hay and water out. Then, during the fires, volunteer firefighters were putting their lives on the line and, indeed, losing their lives. Then, with the floods, we had the SES, and people were stepping up and volunteering and donating. I'd like to thank all the people in Cowper for what you have done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such extraordinary times call for an extraordinary budget, and I'm proud of this coalition's budget. This is a once-in-a-century shock that requires an unprecedented level of support across the economy. The government's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic provided $299 billion in support. It was exactly what the Australian people needed, because it has helped us get to this point, and the budget will help to get us through. This budget is a strong economic plan to enable local businesses to get through the triple crises of COVID-19, bushfires and droughtâand, in some places, floodsâand provide them with the confidence and the hope to continue. That's what we do as politicians: we provide hope to people of the land. We may not agree on everything, but our intent is there. We want the Australian people to succeed, and we want Australian businesses to succeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest successes of this budget has to be the extension of the instant asset write-off scheme, and you would only understand that if you have run a business. It might escape you if you've worked in the public service all your life, and I'm not suggesting that's a bad thing. What I'm suggesting is if you've worked in business you understand how important this instant asset write-off is. It means you are not carrying the debt, the millstone around your neck, of a substantial purchase for the whole of the year. What you're doing is writing it off instantly, and what that does is put the money back in the coffers. And because the money is there and it's accessible, what happens? The business can grow. You can put more people on or, God forbid, put some money in your back pocket for your hard work, for the slog of the day. This instant asset write-off has been extremely well-received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I received an email from Rodney Mole. He is the manager of RM Diesel in Kempsey, and he said, 'The instant asset write-off has allowed us to purchase a new test bench and surface grinder to recondition and overhaul diesel engines. It has allowed us to fast-track the upgrade of essential business capital. The new equipment really helps the turnaround time in our busy workshop. We mainly serve transport and agriculture, so better efficiency from us gets them back on the job faster. It's a win-win.' That's a real person saying that we've just bought this, we've implemented it into our business and people who are coming to us are getting their machinery back quicker for them to work, because we've been able to do that because of this instant asset write-off. This is huge. So it's not only assisting businesses, but it willâand canâcreate jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury estimates that the $4 billion JobMaker Hiring Credit scheme on top of the instant asset write-off will support 450,000 jobs by giving employers incentives for each new job they create over the next 12 months for someone who's been on JobSeeker or youth allowance or a parenting payment. And I'll concede: there are plenty of people on JobSeeker, youth allowance and parenting payments in my electorate. We've been hit hard. The predominant industries in my electorate are tourism and hospitalityâthe first ones to get hit and the last ones to come out of it. So this plan to create 450,000 new jobs by contributing $200 a week to employees for somebody under 30 and $100 a week for somebody under 35 will create incentive for employers. And I know that, because I talk to them and they've told me so. I've spoken to many business owners over the past two weeks. The principal from PRD Real Estate was one. He said he's going to put on three new young people to support his senior staff in his real estate office. The director of Hopkins Consultants in Port Macquarie said that the job-hiring credit will give him confidence to hire a young civil drafting and design trainee. And of course we can't forget that the wages for new apprentices and trainees have been subsidised too, and that's in any size business in any industry. We're not targeting anyone. We're just allowing that to happen, allowing businesses and industry to get on with the job and employ young people as apprentices and trainees. That's a $1.2 billion measure where employers will be eligible for 50 per cent of the wages for a new or recommencing apprentice or trainee up to $7,000 a quarter. That's substantial. When you're an employer, that is a substantial amount of money if you're considering whether or not to put someone on. That $28,000 a year will make the difference. It has made the difference. People are already putting apprentices and trainees on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course there are the tax cuts. Australians work hard. They deserve to have more money in their back pocket. There is no point taxing the Australian worker to get out of debt. It has never worked in the past. Why would it work in the future? That's why we haven't done that. We're giving them tax cuts. Low- and middle-income earners will receive up to $2,745 of relief compared with 2017-18 and high-income earners will receive $2,565 of relief compared with financial year 2017-18.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot forget the record infrastructure investment. This infrastructure investment will make a huge difference in my electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman, I know how concerned you are about the road toll. I know your advocacy for reducing the road toll. That's why in the election there was an additional $490.6 million for the Coffs Harbour bypass. This is effectively the last link in the M1, with the exception of the Heatherbrae bypass. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years there have been thousands of deaths on this road. This will address that very issue, and I'll address the social and economic benefits. This will create safe passage for residents of Coffs Harbour, Cowper and Australia and those visiting our shores when we finally open the borders. This will create 12,000 new jobs over the life of the build, and 80 per cent will be local builders, local tradies and local labourers. For five years there will be an additional 12,000 jobs. Every single day it will take over 12,000 vehicles off the road going through Coffs Harbour. It will improve the amenity, the safety and all of Coffs Harbour for the benefit of those living in Coffs Harbour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, there was the much smaller and quieter investment of $1.5 million to seal a five-kilometre stretch of The Hatch Road near Port Macquarie. During my campaignâand you know that this is my first time in this placeâI became aware that that road had been ripped up about 10 years ago by the local council. In the past 12 months that road had been resealed with crushed concrete containing crystalline silica. Many may not be aware that crystalline silica is the new asbestos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Along this five-kilometre stretch of road there are 80 residents on small farm allotments. Kids live there. The school bus goes down there every day. There is an equestrian centre where kids go to learn how to ride. Every time it was dryâand it was dry for a very long timeâand a car or a truck drove down there, plumes of this crystalline silica would be sent into the air, across the fields, into the water catchments and onto the roofs of the homes. They're not on town water there and that crystalline silica would wash into the water tanks when it rained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to see in this budget $1.5 million to seal that road, because the little things are so important. I think the saying is, 'The smallest fish are the sweetest.' The little things, this $1.5 million, means more to the community of The Hatch Road than the $491 million for the bypass, because it's about their health, their safety and their amenity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous benefits in this budget. But one that I'm very, very pleased about is the $5.7 billion towards mental health. Because this has been tough. This has been tough for all Australians, particularly young Australians. We have seen a tragic spike in youth suicide all over Australia. It doesn't discriminate. It doesn't discriminate between cultures. It doesn't discriminate between economic classes. I was really pleased that this government has recognised that and has ensured that we're going to be there for those who are having mental health challenges, particularly the youth. I was very happy to be at the groundbreaking of the new headspace in Kempsey. They have been getting by with an outreach centre, but now they're going to get their own youth centre. One in four young people who walk through that door will be Indigenous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is a good budget. It's providing for all Australians, and it's providing for those Australians who are less fortunate. I certainly am proud to get out there and tell people that I'm proud of my government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (19<span class="HPS-Time">:26</span>):  In the short time we have left this evening I'll start my contribution and continue it tomorrow. Obviously throughout this year Australians have faced their first pandemic in a century and their first recession in 30 years. The COVID crisis has tested us in ways we never expected. We've had to spend long periods of time without seeing our friends, families and colleagues. Many in our communities have lost their jobs as Australians have selflessly put the health of the broader community above their own material interests. It's not been easy, but we are getting through it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's federal budget was a chance to address the twin crises that Australia is facing: the COVID pandemic and the recession that has been exacerbated, lengthened and deepened by the weaknesses in the economy because of the decisions that the Morrison government has made in the past six years. But it also had the opportunity to rebuild in a way that left a legacy, that reformed many of the structural problems we've got within our economy and society, and that built in resilience into our communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that is not what the government did in this budget. This year's budget leaves us with a trillion dollars in Liberal debt, but it leaves behind no long-term, lasting legacy. A trillion dollars of Liberal debt, but millions of Australians are still left behind, denied the support they need and forgotten by the government when they need it most. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own community of Ballarat we've faced our fair share of challenges over the past month. Whilst we have escaped the extended hard lockdown endured by Melburnians, our businesses again were forced to close and our community again closed down as the virus unfortunately re-emerged across our state and, at times, in our own community. Our community has borne these challenges well. We know why we were doing it, and we're proud, in regional Victoria particularly, of our success. But that doesn't mean that it has been at all easy. Many in our community are still out of work. Many businesses are closed and many are still struggling to get by. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than providing extra support through the budget, the Morrison government is continuing to cut the JobKeeper payments, leaving around 20,000 people in my community worse off. With nearly one million Australians unemployed and unemployment expected to increase, it frankly makes no sense for the Morrison government to be withdrawing support, not just from Victorians, but from those industries that are going to take quite some time to recover, such as aviation and tourism. Without a comprehensive jobs plan to actually replace it, it is a very, very blunt mechanism. Our community is just coming out of lockdown and businesses are just beginning to reopenânot all of them yet. Now is not the time to be withdrawing that support, just when we're literally getting up onto our knees. </span>
