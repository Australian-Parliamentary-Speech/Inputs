       Tertiary Education
      </title>
      <para>
       The Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers:
      </para>
      <para>
       Tertiary Education
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt burden or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualification for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher-education. Given that 70 per cent of teacher-education students are women, these cut-backs will have a disastrous effect on women's access to education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) that the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education unless they are rationalised be rescinded.
      </para>
      <para>
       And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever humbly pray.

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post-secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditure) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their financial difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) the imposition of post-secondary tuition fees of comparable levels to those imposed prior to 1971 would force many currently enrolled students to discontinue their studies and deter many persons willing and able at present to undertake post-secondary study from doing so.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) those students and potential students from social groups currently under-represented and disadvantaged in the post-secondary education system would be most severely affected by the reintroduction of fees for post-secondary education.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. post-secondary tuition fees not be re-introduced for any courses or for any category of students
      </para>
      <para>
       2. the visa charges upon private overseas students be removed immediately

       3. the Minister for Education immediately clarify the Government's attitude to the reintroduction of post-secondary tuition fees.

       We the undersigned believe it is the duty of our government to promote peace. We believe the greatest threat to peace lies in the division of the world into two blocs grouped around the United States and the Soviet Union.

       Trans-Australia Airlines
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.

       Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in-

      <para>
       (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;

       Excise on Beer
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The club industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The club industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. The club industry is entirely within the private sector and makes a contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The club industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The club industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian club industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the club industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.
      </para>
      <para>
       11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       12. The club industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian club industry in the social and economic life of the nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Accept that the viability of the club industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the club needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.
      </para>
      <para>
       And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.

      <para>
       7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.
      </para>
      <para>
       11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.
      </para>
      <para>
       And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.

       (i) the financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditure) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their financial difficulties.
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) The introduction of a loans scheme, subsequent review of the level of TEAS and the tightening of the eligibility criteria for TEAS will cause great financial hardship and will deter students from enrolling in tertiary institutions.

      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under 'Cosmetics' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.

       Plant Variety Rights

      </para>
      <para>
       1. Note that legislation establishing plant variety rights in other countries has had adverse effects, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise the maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic material from falling into private hands.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant variety rights in Australia.

I would have thought that many governments would want to do all they could to reduce tensions. Israel and Egypt have been in pursuit of peace between them. Ten years ago that would have been regarded as an impossible achievement, but it has been advanced by the Camp David Accords. They may not have gone as far as many people would like; nonetheless the situation is a vast improvement on the state of open hostility and warfare that had existed between Israel and Egypt in the past. If things can be done to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East, I believe that any government should weigh the consequences seriously. There should not be a necessary connection between the events of the last day or two and the furtherance of the Camp David Accords. I hope that honourable members of this House will be able to keep the two things separate in their own judgments.

         —The House is well aware of the interest and concern of the honourable member for Wentworth in this matter. The House is also aware that the Government is currently accepting approximately 4,500 East European refugees in this financial year. This is the highest intake of the program which has been running for some years and which has always included a high proportion of Polish refugees. At the time the refugees are interviewed by Australian immigration authorities they are advised to expect considerable difficulties in the achievement of family reunions in the event of their settling in Australia. This is not the making of the Australian Government but rather reflects difficulties that members of the refugee families can expect in being granted exit authorities by the Polish Government. Reports received by the Government early this year suggested that since the events of late 1980 the Polish authorities were becoming more liberal in the issue of passports for travel to Western countries. According to one recent report, the number of travel documents issued so far this year is 45 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. However, it now appears that this general liberalisation is not always being extended to the families of people whom the Polish Government regard as being illegally abroad.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Australian Government has received complaints that passport applications are being refused and of attendant difficulties being experienced by family members of Polish refugees. The House can be assured that the Government is concerned about an early and acceptable solution to the problem of family reunions and is conscious of the anxiety of members of the Polish community. We will continue to make representations to the Polish authorities in such cases where these are seen to be helpful and appropriate.

         —I will not comment on the substance of questions based on communications between my colleague and Secretary of State Haig. I am disturbed at the persistent thrust of questioning by members of the Opposition. Quite plainly the Middle East area has been disturbed by hostilities for decades. We know quite well that a major disturbance or difficulty, a further movement by the Soviet Union from Afghanistan to Iran using what it has gained in Afghanistan as a foothold, would have possibilities of enormous consequence for the whole world. Whilst that area might be beyond Australia's direct strategic area of concern-let me emphasise the word 'direct'-it is quite clear that events could happen in the Middle East which would be of vast consequence to all the Western world, including Australia, and of vast consequence to the peace of the world. It is against that background that I think any Australian government ought to look seriously at the arguments for and the undoubted arguments against any possible Australian involvement. There are legitimate and honourable arguments on both sides of this equation. It comes, finally, therefore, to a matter of judgment by the Australian Government as to what is in the best interests of Australia and of our contribution to peace.

        We have been involved in other areas beyond our direct strategic interest. We have said that we are prepared to contribute to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Namibia. That is not in our direct area of interest, but it will help to advance the common cause of peace and well-being of peoples if the United Nations proposals for Namibia can be put into effect. That will involve a multination peacekeeping force. On many occasions we have been involved in areas beyond our direct strategic interest because we have a concern for the well-being and peace of mankind.

Does the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment recall that some years ago, at the time of the referendum to choose a national tune, the nation was advised that in due course a suitable form of words would be chosen? Is the Minister aware of my forwarding to his predecessor several word form suggestions received by me from people right across the nation and my asking his predecessor whether we are awaiting a revolution before something is done? Can I inform my constituents that the present words are now official, or has the Government something else positive in mind? If so, when will the long awaited decision be made?

         —Yes, I am aware and other members of this House are well aware that in 1977 a poll was taken to get the view of the Australian people as to which tune they preferred for a national tune. The majority of people at that poll indicated that they wanted the tune known as Advance Australia Fair. Since that time there have been many suggestions as to which words should be used, for there are at present no official words for that tune. In 1979 the Government established the National Australia Day Committee and sought from that Committee its views on the words which might be used for the tune. That Committee considered the traditional words by P. McCormick. It also sought the advice of the Literature Board of the Australia Council, and a contemporary poet was asked to put forward some suggestions. Many suggestions were received from people around the country.

        I am aware of the great interest of the honourable member for Fadden and constituents within the electorate of Fadden whose words he has sent to me for consideration. There are continuing representations on the matter. I am aware that there is great interest in a decision as to what words should be adopted, and the matter is under consideration. I am not in a position to indicate when a decision can be reached as to what will be the official words. When that decision is reached one would hope that a conclusion can be achieved resulting in words that will be generally acceptable to the Australian people.

         —My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it still the Australian Government's view, as stated in a cable to United States Secretary of State Haig on 27 April, that European Community countries have a major stake in a peaceful settlement in the Middle East? Is it also still the case, as stated in that cable, that the Australian Government is particularly concerned that no major European countries appear to be under active consideration as possible participants in the proposed United States-organised peacekeeping force in the Sinai? In the event that Australia agrees to join the peacekeeping force, does this reluctance by nations with an established stake in Middle East peace to endorse the American proposal expose an Australian contingent to the charge that it is a mere rump force and part of a United States strategic ground presence in the area? In view of these considerations, and in view of the serious escalation of violence in the Middle East arising from the Israeli raid on Iraq, will the Government declare unequivocally that Australia will not take part in the Sinai peacekeeping force and become embroiled in a situation that is becoming increasingly dangerous?

But let me say only that I would have thought that any Australian government would want to know quite plainly, since the Camp David Accords relate to peace between Egypt and Israel, that if there were to be a peacekeeping force the total membership of that force would be completely acceptable to both Egypt and Israel. The best way to achieve that is quite plainly to follow the course that the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined. But at the same time that communication makes it perfectly plain that no decision has been made. The response of the Secretary of State to that also acknowledges quite plainly that no decision has been made by the Australian Government, as indeed it has not up to this point. I have no doubt that the attempts by the Leader of the Opposition to relate the circumstances in the Middle East to circumstances in Indo-China will be noted.

         —I am not sure of the over-run of expenditure at the Townsville airport, if there is any over-run, but I would like to assure the honourable member that none of the works referred to has been abandoned. Construction is proceeding to schedule. Only one or two minor items are expected to be completed beyond the end of July. All the initial works have been completed or will be completed by then, to facilitate the limited number of international flights from and to Townsville at the present time. A number of other works are currently being considered by the Department. One of them is the construction of additional apron for domestic air services. There is provision for a shelter between the international airport and the domestic facilities and additional car park facilities for international traffic. Quite a lot of planning is being done to improve the total facility at that airport.

        The Government, in the course of its budgetary considerations, will take a decision on the level of expenditure and the level of priority which will be accorded to that expenditure within the overall expenditure for airports throughout Australia. I might say that the Government is facing a very substantial capital outlay in airport expenditure right around Australia. The latest estimates indicate that it could be somewhere between $1,300m and $1,400m over the next decade in order to accommodate the wide-bodied jets and to provide upgraded facilities at some of our major capital city airports. Townsville, now being an international airport, will of course be receiving the priority necessary to maintain a growing degree of traffic from that airport. I would like to thank the honourable member for Herbert, as the local member for that area, for the co-operation that he has given me in relation to plans that have been developed.

         —Organised crime, and particularly drug trafficking as a part of that organised crime scene, presents very large problems to this Government and to various State governments. Therefore, the Commonwealth Government, in co-operation with State governments, is determined that it will develop its policing agencies, particularly the Australian Federal Police, so that the people involved in organised crime and drug trafficking can be sought out and eventually brought to justice. The formation of the joint task force with the New South Wales Government was a joint initiative following the Woodward and Williams royal commissions. The honourable member asked about the number of people involved. We have 15 Australian Federal Police officers attached to the task force, as well as three administrative officers who are provided by the Department of Administrative Services. I am told that the net cost up to the end of this financial year is estimated at about $380,000. That is after allowance is made for the cost-sharing arrangements between the two governments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The methods that have been used by the task force are those that were recommended by Williams and Woodward. Basically, the task force is targeting its efforts on those people who are central to drug trafficking or drug trafficking groups. Of recent months the Commonwealth directed that the task force extend its activities to looking into drug trafficking associated with the Nugan Hand bank and people involved in drug trafficking who may have had associations with the Nugan Hand bank. The work of the task force will take a long time. I am advised that up to 1 May the task force can claim the following achievements: Five groups involved in the importation of heroin have been broken up. Another four groups supplying heroin have also been broken up, as well as a minor group that has been supplying morphine. In all, a total of 66 offenders have been charged on a total of 186 counts, including 40 persons in relation to the importation and supply of heroin and three in relation to the supply of morphine. Until 21 April this year a total of 718.5 grams of heroin had been seized by the task force.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate that the commitment of the Government, in co-operation with State governments, to attacking those people involved, particularly those central to organised crime, is something that we intend to pursue with all the vigour we can. I have spoken about only one task force. Other task forces have been established or are intended to be established with the New South Wales and Victorian governments. I hope that as the months unfold the sort of success that the New South Wales-Commonwealth task force is having will also be evident in those task forces.

The Australian Broadcasting Commission FM stations depend on the overall funds to be provided for the ABC.

         —What I have said, of course, is that the legislation in New South Wales will be corruptive and corrosive, and it is. It means quite plainly that every time Mr Wran cannot build a pre-school and cannot do something for a school or hospital he is saying that the funding of the Australian Labor Party with taxpayers' dollars is more important than that pre-school, that women's refuge and all the rest. If that is Mr Wran's and the Labor Party's exhibition of political priorities, quite plainly it is not ours. In addition to that, the Wran socialist legislation establishes an inspectorate which will make it possible for the New South Wales Government to discriminate against individuals and corporations that provide funds to other political parties. It will also make it possible for the New South Wales socialist Government to give that information to trade unions, which would then use their undoubted power to destroy the corporations that might be involved. The purposes of this legislation are certainly of very doubtful merit. They will be corruptive of the political processes in New South Wales. They represent a condemnation of the political priorities of the Wran Government. The most insidious part of the legislation is the establishment of the inspectorate, which will be able to look into the books of political parties, with the resulting invasion of privacy involved and then the possible use of the information that will be thus gained.

         —The Indicative Planning Council is an independent and authoritative advisory body which forecasts short, medium and long term trends in the housing industry. Membership of the Council is drawn from builders' and industry organisations, organisations in the housing finance sector, trade unions, the real estate industry, materials suppliers, the Reserve Bank of Australia, Commonwealth departments and individuals prominent in the housing industry. Council Chairman, Professor Noel Drane, is Professor of Economics at Macquarie University, Sydney. Besides the national Council, committees operate in each State and the Australian Capital Territory. It is impressive to see the way that members of the industry with such varied backgrounds have worked hard together to produce such a timely and relevant report. Sectional interests have been set aside so that an impartial overview of industry prospects could be compiled. I thank Council members, and particularly the Chairman, for their work.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The report concludes that due to the impact of the resources boom, higher overseas migration and the emerging widely-based recovery in the economy, demand for housing will show a gradual increase over the coming three years. Further growth in demand is likely during the 1980s. The report also predicts that housing activity will increase not only this financial year but also in 1981-82. Dwelling completions are forecast to increase from 129,300 in 1979-80 to 135,500 in 1980-81 and to 139,000 in 1981-82. Dwelling commencements, after showing strong growth in 1979-80, will increase to 136,000 in 1980-81 and 139,000 in 1981-82. Such forecasts, which are good news for the housing industry, are given added weight by the calibre and composition of the Council. But the Council also notes that this relatively strong picture for activity is dependent on housing finance institutions being able to compete for funds at interest rates which do not choke off demand.
       </para>
       <para>
        The council also recognises that the national picture hides wide variations at the State and regional level. In 1981-82 activity is expected to increase markedly in Victoria, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, remain buoyant in Queensland, show some recovery in South Australia, remain stable in Tasmania and decline marginally in New South Wales. The capital investment surge, particularly in resource related projects, is identified as a major influence on housing activity during the 1980s. It will bring significant benefits to the housing industry but also may create problems. The main message contained in the report is that the health of the housing industry will depend upon sound policies and planning by all levels of government, designed to ensure that the industry is a beneficiary not a casualty of the resources boom. The resources boom is already placing large demands on the capital market. The industry is facing competition from semi-government authorities borrowing to finance resource related projects and infrastructure development.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government has sought to restrain its own demands on the capital market by reducing overall public sector borrowing and by reining in the deficit. But the Commonwealth Government cannot expect to be able to overcome all the problems on its own. We will lead the way but planning, co-operative effort and far sighted policies are required from all levels of government. State Governments should examine their expenditure plans critically to ensure they do not siphon off too large a share of available finance and labour. They should plan adequately for the housing and social facilities they need before they permit massive development.
       </para>
       <para>
        If all governments do not discipline their own demands and those of their authorities, housing borrowers could be crowded out and the building industry dealt a damaging blow. I hope this is borne in mind by States when they come to the Loan Council discussions on 19 June. At the same time State Governments should be aware that unrealistic interest rate ceilings imposed on permanent building societies are hindering the flow of funds to these institutions. Neither the permanent building societies nor any other financial institutions are guaranteed a share of available funds. If interest rates are overcontrolled, the report points out that the result is frequently to dry up the flow of funds. That is why the Commonwealth allowed an increase in bank housing loan rates and removed the regulations on deposit rates. Bank lending for housing has picked up considerably. In the March quarter 1981, the number of loans approved for dwellings by savings banks increased by over 9 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. That means more prospective home buyers are now home owners.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it does not end just with the finance sector. The resources boom is likely to place pressure on the labour market and housing costs. Already the Commonwealth Government has taken initiatives designed to ensure that the benefits of the resources boom are maximised and that people's housing aspirations are met. Besides announcing higher immigration targets, which increase the supply of labour to all industries and also increase housing demand, the Government has lifted its support for labour training programs. The Commonwealth has supported the work of the Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council on housing costs. It supports the conclusion of the inquiry into the nature and terms of employment in the New South Wales housing industry that there should be no change to the cost effective sub-contract system of housing construction.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Council has indicated, in a climate of intense competition for finance and pressure on housing costs, further pressures are likely on home ownership rates. I will be watching the situation closely and examining the flexibility of housing programs and appropriateness of policies. The housing industry is well placed to capitalise on the growth forecast by the Council during the 1980s as long as constructive and far sighted policies are maintained. I can assure honourable members that my Government has a strong commitment to maintaining a healthy and stable housing industry and that this report will be carefully considered as we make our major decisions. The 1981 report of the Indicative Planning Council has come at an opportune time and provides a full discussion of the prospects and issues facing the industry. I highly recommend it to members of this Parliament, the industry and governments at all levels.

         —The Opposition welcomes the report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. The Council is a remnant of what is remaining of the Federal Labor Government of 1972-75. This Council was established by the Labor Government to advise on the estimated needs and capacity of the housing industry in order to assist government intervention to provide stability in the housing market. The sad situation is that in no way has this market forces government paid any heed to the advice of the Indicative Planning Council in the past. But we are grateful for the crumbs that fall from the Government's table. At least this body is still intact and can still make reports to this Parliament. Someone in the bureaucracy may draw information from it and that may have some influence on the Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The advice from this Council remains the only advice which is provided to the Federal Government in relation to housing policy. I am not trying to be personal about the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) or the Government-I suppose, in a way the Minister will want to take advice from the Council-but we know that the market forces controlled by the Department of the Treasury are the dominant authority in the Government relating to the housing industry. They are the forces that really determine what occurs in relation to the housing policy of this Government. The housing industry has been the real casualty of this Government's policies both in the public sector and in the private sector. This is the only body which can have any influence on the Federal Government's housing policy. The recommendations of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty have had no real influence on the housing industry policies of this Government. The Government also has not been influenced by the recommendations of the Eyers Committee of Inquiry into Housing Costs. The Government has failed to assess the housing needs, the number of homeless in Australia, the population mix, size and age, the regional dislocation that is now occurring on a large scale, the quality of housing stock, and the adequacy of aged persons accommodation. The Fraser Government shows no evidence of acting on the advice of the Indicative Planning Council. It shows no intention of intervening to offset the disruptions in the housing market and no preparedness to plan ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Indicative Planning Council considers the effective demand for housing rather than housing need. I criticise the membership of the Indicative Planning Council even though, as the Minister said, it does represent a very wide section of the community. It has representatives from the building associations such as the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association-the ownership and production level of the industry. It includes one representative of the trade union movement on its membership, but there is no representative of the consumers on that Council. There is no representative from the housing co-operative groups and other bodies such as the Shelter organisation that should be represented so that there is some understanding of the social needs and problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Council underestimates the real requirements for housing provision. It underestimates the real social problems of 80,000 families which are on housing commission lists. These lists are growing and will grow dramatically in the next few years. It underestimates the problems of the 250,000 people living in caravans and in temporary accommodation and it underestimates the problems of the 150,000 homeless people throughout this country. Australia's population in the next two decades will increase by one-third. There is no indication of that in the report. The Indicative Planning Council works from the assumptions of government policy in relation to impacts of resource development and the availability and price of housing finance. Yet in no way does this Indicative Planning Council report deal with the deregulation of the capital market or interest rate increases. There is no real understanding of that situation. In fact, the Council implies that interest rates will hold their present levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        In spite of all these limitations, the Indicative Planning Council report poses a challenge to the Fraser Government's policy. The 1981 report indicates a range of pressures emerging in the supply of labour, land and material in the context of expanding resource development or tourist resort activity in a number of regions. It is a matter of regret that the earlier years when such advice was available were not used more effectively to absorb labour lost from the building industry and to train a higher number of new apprentices. When labour and materials were under-used, this Government began cutting back on the housing industry in a way which raised prices. The price of building materials in New South Wales, where the housing industry was more buoyant, rose at a faster rate than in States such as Victoria. The Government undermined the capacity of the housing industry to cope with emerging needs. As a result, the pressures are greater now than they should be. According to the Council, the resources development activity is likely to affect the demand for housing in different regions, the cost of housing, the availability and cost of housing finance, finance for developers and infrastructure finance. On page 7 of its report the Council states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether this demand is reflected in the rental sector or as increased demand for owner occupation, will depend in part on the availability and cost of housing finance, and in the cost of purchasing a dwelling.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Council implies that the position is so difficult that more housing will be made available for rental. I question that. The monthly repayments for a $30,000 loan, repaid over 25 years at an interest rate of 11.5 per cent, are $305. I ask leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out monthly repayments and total repayments of loans of $20,000, $25,000 and $30,000 with various interest rates over a 25-year period.

         —I thank the House. It costs $305 a month for a $30,000 loan over a 25-year period. In Sydney the bottom of the market for a house and land is now $50,000. A person would need to earn about $300 a week to qualify for a loan of $30,000. Average weekly earnings are $250 a week. That means that 70 per cent to 73 per cent of all male wage earners are excluded from purchasing a home. So it is becoming an impossible dream for some people in Sydney and the situation is becoming just as difficult in other cities and States. It is becoming a tragic situation under these regressive policies of this Government. On page 6 of the report the Council states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In areas where the resource developer is not required to make a major contribution to finance for local infrastructure, major financial and administrative pressures on local authorities frequently serve to restrict the supply of serviced residential land and place a heavy debt burden on the local community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Particularly in the western suburbs of Sydney, because of the Government's resources policy, local government authorities are finding it hard to fulfil their loan allocations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        Increased pressure on the supply of housing and housing costs can be expected. This may not be a significant problem for those who have high incomes deriving from the development or whose housing is company supplied. For others, particularly those on low incomes renting in the private market, there can be severe personal hardship. These difficulties have already emerged in some areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the Government's Indicative Planning Council talking about what is occurring within our community. The inference is, firstly, that resource developers should pay more towards their costs. It is about time that the resource developers paid more towards infrastructure costs. Secondly, it is essential to improve forward planning. There is no forward planning because this Government isolates its position from State and local governments. This Government thinks that all it has to do is supply 2 per cent of the income tax for local government and it has met its responsibilities. It is transferring more and more responsibilities to local government, and there is not that interrelationship which is so necessary between Australian State and local governments if we are to overcome these difficult housing and social infrastructure problems in those areas. Thirdly, it is necessary that action be taken to protect low income tenants. How can we protect low income tenants? If we look at 1974-75, the last full year of Labor Government, we made available $150m in constant terms to the Commonwealth, the States, the Territories, and Aboriginals. In the coming year all that this Government will make available is a base amount of $200m. That represents a cut in the public sector from $850m in the peak year of the Labor Government to $200m this year. That is another difficult problem. This Government is squeezing the housing industry not only in the public sector but also in the private sector.

        On page 61 of the report the Indicative Planning Council considered the problems of Gladstone and its relationship to the large development proposals and the limitations of the expensive provision of accommodation. Similar problems are foreshadowed for the Hunter region and for Portland. Last night I gave figures on the housing situation in the Latrobe Valley. It costs between $85 and $105 a week for a normal worker to rent a house in that area, if a house can be obtained. In Gladstone 25 per cent of the people are now living in caravans. This is a social problem which has not been taken up by the Government. On page 9 of its report the Indicative Planning Council deals with the question of adequacy of housing finance. It states:

       <para>
        Housing finance institutions are already facing considerable competition from semi-government authorities borrowing to finance resource-related and other infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is right. Again, the Government cannot pass the buck to the State governments. It got out into the highways and byways and argued about Australia being the El Dorado of tomorrow, the great resource boom. This Government forced through this policy. It is about time that this national government co-operated with the States to overcome those problems. Even the Minister for Housing is still fiddling figures. The sad thing about this is that the Minister said today:

       <para>
        That is why the Commonwealth allowed an increase in bank housing loan rates and removed the regulations on deposit rates. Bank lending for housing has picked up considerably. In the March quarter 1981, the number of loans approved for dwellings by savings banks increased by over 9 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms.

        However, the value of loans approved for new dwellings is forecast to decline slightly in 1980-81 because the proportion of funds lent for new dwellings is expected to continue to fall.

         —by leave-I wish to outline for the information of honourable members the conclusions reached by the Government following an assessment of the recommendations in the report of the Law Reform Commission on insurance agents and brokers. The Law Reform Commission report recommended that legislation should be introduced to regulate the activities of insurance brokers by imposing registration requirements, compliance with certain financial requirements, compulsory professional indemnity and fidelity guarantee insurance, and prohibitions on certain relationships between brokers and insurers. Views were sought on the Commission's report from insurance industry organisations and other interested parties, the States and the Northern Territory. Whilst those groups that responded generally favoured regulation of brokers, their reaction to the terms and coverage of regulation proposed by the Commission differed significantly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As should now be well known, the Government's general view on intervention in commercial relationships is that a clear need must be demonstrated before Commonwealth regulatory legislation is considered. The Government does not believe such a need has been established either by the Law Reform Commission or by others making submissions. Indeed, the recent decision on the Review of Commonwealth Functions requires by the Government critical examination of existing supervision of the insurance industry. It is clear that over the past decade the vast majority of broker transactions have been conducted in a satisfactory manner. Losses from broker insolvencies over this period, while attracting considerable publicity, have represented only a minute proportion of business turnover. The more than $7.25m known to the Law Reform Commission to have been lost from broker insolvencies in the 10 years preceding its report represented less than 0.1 per cent of premiums handled by brokers in the period. Furthermore, it appears that much the greater part of those losses have affected businesses rather than individual consumers. It should also be recognised that the States have traditionally been the regulators of intermediaries such as solicitors and estate agents and in areas of consumer protection. Several States either have or are foreshadowing legislation in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        One aspect of the pattern of operations of insurance brokers does appear to be worthy of special attention. That is the traditional practice in the general insurance industry whereby brokers, and to some extent other insurance intermediaries, are entrusted with premiums and other moneys which they are able to hold and invest, or otherwise use on their own account and receive income therefrom, over and above whatever commission is received by them. While it is evident that the great majority of brokers handle these moneys in a responsible manner, potential does exist for abuse. In large part, this practice amounts to extended credit to brokers. It enables them to extend credit to clients or to hold permium moneys for periods exceeding normal business practice before the moneys are transmitted to insurers.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to this particular aspect, consideration will be given, in consultation with the insurance industry, to amending the Insurance Act 1973 with a view to circumscribing dependence on extended credit terms and to ameliorating the consequences of broker failure for insureds and insurers, provided this can be done without undue regulation or administrative cost. I will be making a further statement on that matter, in conjunction with the introduction of a number of amendments to other areas of the Insurance Act, at a later date. I should emphasise that the Government remains of the view that the most effective approach to the basic issues relating to insurance brokers is the development of sound and appropriate self-regulatory practices. No system of regulation can provide an ultimate assurance against loss in all circumstances. But with self-regulation consumers are given the freedom of choice to deal with intermediaries who are subject to such arrangements, or, if they prefer, to seek services elsewhere in the market. The ultimate judgment can therefore rest with the consumer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might point out that there is now no shortage of readily identifiable insurance brokers operating within the market who are subject to self-regulatory arrangements. Specifically, the Confederation of Insurance Brokers of Australia and the Insurance Brokers Association of Australia impose membership requirements similar in a number of respects to the controls recommended by the Law Reform Commission. The Government would hope that any prospective legislation by the States will recognise the benefits of these existing self-regulatory arrangements and have regard to the advantages associated with uniformity in controls. In this latter context the Commonwealth Government stands ready to assist wherever it may be able in achieving uniformity between the States in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am conscious that there will be some in the community who will be disappointed that the Government has not embarked upon the course of full-scale regulatory legislation. However, Governments have to justify the cost of regulatory intervention by establishing a clear public interest in so intervening. It is often erroneously claimed that the only answer to default and dishonesty is to pass more legislation. On the contrary, whilst legislation can go some way to reduce bad and inefficient practices, no amount of legislation can provide a guarantee against fraud and business failures. The attempt to provide such a guarantee would inevitably bring with it an unacceptable level of intervention in the affairs of businesses and individuals. I commend the statement to the House. I present the following paper:

         —The statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) destroys five years of detailed and constructive investigation and recommendations on the need to legislate for insurance brokers. It is a slap in the face to the industry, to the community and, above all, to Professor David St Leger Kelly and the staff of the Law Reform Commission. The Treasurer has not even had the courtesy to pay a tribute to the work of the Commission.

       </talk.start>

        The track record of Liberal governments over the years, particularly in the field of insurance, is simple of definition. It is a series of rearguard actions taken after the horse has bolted, of closing off certain stable doors in the hope that in doing so policy holders will be protected against further failures in the future. This is no way to act responsibly in a highly complex and important industry such as the insurance industry. I have read the debates in England; the Minister obviously has not. Past actions have been repeated time after time. Voluntary controls, however good, have been inadequate. There are some who would argue that the industry itself has failed and has passed the buck to the Government. It has been demonstrated that the whole field of insurance is too big and complex to be operated entirely by voluntary control. The policy holder pays a premium and in return he gets a mere promise-a promise that on the happening of some event the insurer has a contingent liability and will pay. The Government must be concerned as to whether the people who make the promise are suitable persons. It must also be concerned about their capacity to carry out their promise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the legislation was to deal with the severe problems faced by members of the insuring public in relation to misconduct by insurance intermediaries. There are thousands of insurance intermediaries in Australia, the vast majority of whom act honestly in the interests of clients. But cases of misconduct occur and, when they do, severe loss can be caused to numerous honest people. The Treasurer has a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the controls suggested by the Commission after an exhaustive inquiry. Yet the Commission's central recommendations have the support of the insurance industry in its entirety. There has been a whole succession of collapses of insurance broking houses. The total estimated loss incurred in the period 1969-1981 is not $7.3m but $14m. Losses of $7m have occurred over the last two years. Someone has to pick up the tab. Obviously this is left to the policy holders. The Government's inaction in relation to the question quite frankly is scandalous. Protective legislation is desperately needed by the community and will be welcomed by all reputable sections of the industry. It is utterly irresponsible to unload that responsibility back on the States. All the Government is doing is recycling the need as in the case of uniform company law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The need for regulation has been long recognised overseas, within the State jurisdictions and by all sections of the community involved in the broking industry. As the Minister is aware, the Queensland Insurance Act 1960-1976 provides for the licensing of insurance brokers. The United Kingdom brought in legislation in 1977. The Whitlam Government drafted legislation before we got turfed out in 1975. Since then there have been a number of somersaults by the Government. In April 1976 the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer announced that the Government would introduce legislation for the supervision of insurance brokers. In March 1977 the Government reversed this decision and announced its intention to pursue a scheme for self-regulation in conjunction with the Insurance Brokers Council. In 1979 the Treasurer announced that he would seek government approval to develop legislation for voluntary regulation arrangements for brokers. Six months later he changed his mind again. The Government refused to grasp the nettle, claiming that there was no consensus among the various bodies representing brokers on the forms of control that ought to be and might be introduced. The Treasurer waited until the Law Reform Commission's report was tabled. One might be forgiven for expecting that the tabling of the Commission's report would finally have stimulated the Treasurer into some action. Great was my disbelief when on the tabling of the Commission's report in September of last year, after four years of extensive consultation, the Treasurer announced that as a first step in the Government's consideration of the present report he proposed to seek the views of the industry, organisations and interested parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report's recommendations, which I will deal with in more detail, show clearly and unequivocally how endemic is this Government's capacity for vacillation on the regulation of business in the public interest. The Government cannot claim in its defence that the insurance broking lobby is against the legislation. It cannot sustain that claim. Bodies representing the insurance brokers and all sections of the insurance industry have persistently supported and demanded the legislation. We have the spectacle of the Western Australian Government being obliged to bring in legislation. The New South Wales Minister has repeatedly indicated that if the Commonwealth fails to act New South Wales will legislate. The Victorian Minister is committed to bringing in legislation. Unquestionably the only two remaining States will be obliged to bring in legislation to protect the consumer section of the industry. What is the Minister going to have? I will tell him what he will have. He will have a plethora of mismatched, ineffective, inefficient State laws. The situation is scandalous.
       </para>
       <para>
        In September 1976 a reference which I obtained from the then Attorney-General required the Law Reform Commission to report on insurance contract law. I must confess that the Treasurery has overlooked this aspect, which is inextricably mixed up in the whole insurance industry. If one is to bring in recommendations on insurance contract law one has to cover intermediaries. If one does not regulate that one is wasting one's time regulating to update insurance contract law. The Commission reported separately on the regulation of brokers and it is about to bring in a report on insurance contract law. If the Minister were honest, he would request the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to ask the Law Reform Commission to cancel any further procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is an appalling situation that anyone may call himself a broker, whether he is a true broker or an agent tied to a single company. The company is readily misled by this practice, and the major problem with agents is that some insurers will not accept responsibility for them. They choose their agent, but when something goes wrong it is the insured who worries. The insurer simply denies any liability. In the past this has led to scandalous decisions. The insurers have made the insured sign a statement to the effect that the insurer's agent is not the insurer's agent at all. Instead, he is the agent for the insured, and regrettably the courts have upheld this charade. Insurers have also been able to avoid liability by denying that their agents had authority to do certain things. We all know that agents and employees often fill in proposal forms for clients. When those agents make a mistake, the insurer should accept the responsibility. The most frequent complaint is in relation to motor vehicle insurance. A car salesman is an agent or a sub-agent for insurance. He offers to arrange insurance for the buyer, often at scandalously high rates. He fills in the form on the strength of the answers given to him by the buyer. The buyer tells him that he has had two accidents in the last five years. I have handled many such cases. The salesman knows that the insurer may not be willing to insure a buyer with that record, so he writes 'no' alongside the question concerning the buyer's claims history. In that way he makes sure of the contract and his commission. If the insured makes a claim, the inaccuracy of the answer as recorded by the agent is discovered. The insurer denies liability on the basis of the insured's misrepresentation. When the insured says 'It was your agent who made the mistake', the invariable answer that he gets is: 'Too bad'. The insured loses out. That position is intolerable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Disreputable insurers are encouraged by the law to have concern, but they have no concern whatsoever for the behaviour and ethics of their agents. That is bad business practice. Insurers owe a duty to train and supervise their agents. They will do so uniformly only when they are made legally responsible for their conduct. I suggest to the Minister and to Government members that the real question involved is not so much the question of the need to regulate brokers as the need to get some updated revision of insurance contract law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps one other disastrous feature of the collapse of the insurance broker, to which the Minister has made no reference at all, is that a policy holder who has in good faith forwarded his premium to the broker may find that due to the broker's failure to forward the premium to the company he is entirely uninsured. Similarly, an insured may have forwarded funds to the broker in settlement of a claim against it, and this sum may not have been transferred to the insurer. It is true that insurance companies have persistently, for a variety of reasons, assumed liability. According to the legislation, that payment of a premium to a broker discharges the insured's liability to the insurer in respect of that premium. Conversely, that payment to the broker by an insurer of money intended for the insured does not discharge the insurer's responsibility to the insured in respect of those funds; nor should it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Self-regulation has been proved a failure time after time. What is needed is urgent legislation. If there is no legislation, all that we are doing is what we did in the field of company law. We give an open misere to the spiv, the charlatan and the corporate crook. The Minister is misleading the Parliament when he says that the cost involved in self-regulation would be an impost on the taxpayer. If we look at the proposals put by the two insurance brokerage organisations in Australia, it would not have cost a cent. One of their recommendations was that the whole system could be funded entirely from registration fees, if the English practice were to be followed. The Minister was not prepared even to legislate in that form. I repeat that, quite apart from insurance contract law, in the field of insurance brokerage law there is a critical and urgent need for the legislation to be implemented. There is a need for a statutory system of registration of insurance brokers to be supervised by an insurance commissioner, and a life insurance commissioner. There is an obligation for registered brokers to keep all premium moneys and moneys received from insurers in a separate trust account, the investment of which is to be closely controlled. There ought to be heavy penalties for misleading conduct by brokers and agents. Greater protection is needed for consumers by making insurers statutorily liable for the actions of their agents and responsible for premiums received by brokers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's actions, after five years of exhaustive examination, are utterly scandalous and irresponsible. Protective legislation is needed by the community, and it is needed by all reputable sections of the insurance industry. I utterly condemn this Government for its failure to give the insurance industry and the public the protection they deserve. I can say only that after the next Federal election the Labor Government will as a matter of urgency bring in uniform legislation to cover insurance brokers and to update, revise and implement a new code of insurance contract law.

        —This report is the result of the Expenditure Committee's largest inquiry in terms of the amount of information examined and the length of the inquiry. It arose out of concerns expressed to members of the Committee by companies supplying goods to the Commonwealth. The main complaints were of delays in awarding contracts and paying for goods. After a preliminary hearing in September 1978, a sub-committee was established on 25 October 1978 to examine the efficiency of administrative procedures and the effectiveness of the purchasing program in meeting its objectives. I would like to thank my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) for his tireless and thoughtful contribution as Chairman of the Sub-committee. He was a member of the Sub-committee from its inception. I must also thank the other member of the Sub-committee, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), and former members of the Sub-committee, particularly the former member for Henty, Ken Aldred, and the former member for Grayndler, the late Frank Stewart. I was also a member of the Sub-committee.

       Expenditure on purchases of goods and services by the Commonwealth Government is a mess. In 1980-81 the estimated net expenditure, less the salaries and wages of those conducting purchasing, is $4,461m which is over 12 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays. In addition, the Committee has calculated there are about 2,000 purchasing staff with salaries totalling over $25m in the current financial year. Although responsibility for purchasing is dispersed throughout the Commonwealth Government the prime responsibility lies with the Purchasing Division in the Department of Administrative Services. It became apparent to the Committee that the Department of Administrative Services has made significant advances in its operations since the Scott committee completed its inquiry into Commonwealth purchasing in 1974, although some deficiencies remain. By contrast, in other departments and authorities there are many elements of purchasing which have glaring weaknesses. The exceptions to this broad criticism are the trading authorities-that is, those engaged in commercial competition-where purchasing sections appear to be in generally better shape. The Committee believes in many departments and authorities the attention of senior management is confined to matters directly related to the department's area of interest with the result that ancillary matters, including purchasing, receive less attention.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has made 54 recommendations affecting all stages of the purchasing process. The main categories of recommendations are aimed at making purchasing more efficient by avoiding unnecessary expenditure, paying less for goods purchased and reducing staffing requirements. Other recommendations are designed to improve public accountability, examine the effectiveness of programs and improve the management and use of resources. Over the course of the inquiry the Committee looked at a wide range of examples of government purchasing and uncovered many areas of bureaucratic absurdity. The purchase of crockery was an example of this. The House may be interested in brief details of what the Committee learned from evidence on that subject, particularly in relation to the problem of overspecification.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst some departments and authorities judged that commercially available crockery if made to hotelware standard was acceptable, others demanded from suppliers the most stringent tests; so much so that until recently the Department of Veterans' Affairs considered Australian produced crockery unacceptable for its requirements. This meant that the Department of Veterans' Affairs paid 40 per cent to 100 per cent more for crockery than other departments with similar crockery usage. In relation to the Department of Defence, there were two crockery specifications-a 12-page one for other ranks and sergeants messes and an 18-page specification for the officers mess. Included were detailed engineering drawings for the manufacture of a crockery impact machine to test crockery for breakage.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has already achieved some results from the inquiry process itself. The Committee has been successful in having one piece of red tape removed. During the inquiry the Committee found that departments had to obtain approval from the Public Service Board when purchasing office machines. This seemed unnecessary and created inordinate delays. The rules were changed so that only in cases of large value purchases of office machines and for some specified categories did departments need to seek approval from the Public Service Board. Also, a series of threshold levels within the tendering process have been raised in line with the Committee's earlier discussion with the Department of Administrative Services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Before concluding, I wish to pay tribute to the work of Kevin Newbold and Bob Harlow who were the clerks to the Sub-committee. The report owes much to the consciencious work of these two able young men over the course of the inquiry. This has been a long and exhaustive inquiry. The Committee believes its findings and recommendations will assist in more efficient and more effective purchasing. As I indicated earlier, we are talking about $4.5 billion in total and over 12 per cent of the Commonwealth Budget. We look forward to the response of the Government to this report and hope that there will be a broad measure of agreement with the recommendations we have made. I commend the report to the House.

        —by leave- As my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) has said, the report on Commonwealth Government purchasing is the result of an exhaustive and comprehensive inquiry. Fifty-four recommendations are included covering all aspects of purchasing. If the Government implements the recommendations, which I trust it will, there should be a significant improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness with which Commonwealth goods are purchased. There were 236 submissions to the Committee and 75 witnesses appeared before the Committee. Members of the Committee, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) and the honourable member for Hume, made tremendous contributions to the work of the Committee and in the final stages of preparation of the report.

      <para>
       The Sub-committee Chairman during the last Parliament was the former member for Henty, Mr Ken Aldred. He was the main force behind the inquiry and I believe its success is due in considerable measure to the energy he put into it. The late Frank Stewart, the former member for Grayndler, was also on the original sub-committee when it was formed on 25 September 1978. It is hoped that the report reflects the feelings of these two former members. I also wish to make special and favourable mention of the work of the clerk to the Expenditure Committee, Mr M. E. Aldons, and the clerks to the Sub-committee, Mr R. S. Harlow and Mr K. Newbold. Their dedication, their efficiency and their attention to detail has made this the effective report I believe it to be.
      </para>
      <para>
       The expenditure on purchases by the Government is significant, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Hume. This is referred to in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the report. The Joint Committees of Public Accounts and Foreign Affairs and Defence have recently published reports on the purchase of computer and defence equipment respectively. Consequently the Expenditure Committee did not subject these areas to the same degree of scrutiny as it did other areas. The Committee determined the essential elements for effective and efficient purchasing in the Commonwealth. Together these constitute a model of how purchasing should be conducted. In the report these are examined in the logical sequence in which goods are purchased, from deciding what and how much is needed, to ensuring the quality of the goods supplied.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has been anxious not to try improving purchasing by adding more rules, regulations and controls. Rather, it has devised simpler, cheaper and more effective ways of getting goods for the Commonwealth. The Committee does not recommend a central purchasing body for the Commonwealth but suggests that all departments take advantage of the expertise in purchasing built up in other departments, particularly the Department of Administrative Services. The major category of recommendations is designed to reduce costs of goods purchased. The Committee has recommended greater use of government bulk purchasing power. Although the Department of Administrative Services has already made advances in this direction, a lot more needs to be done. The Commonwealth, as previously indicated, is a major purchaser and as such should be able to use its bulk to get better prices, for instance in hospital supplies.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Canberra almost $1m is spent on warehousing facilities for centralised purchasing within the Capital Territory Health Commission, but each hospital still has its own purchasing staff, storage, accounts, et cetera. Much of the purchasing is conducted in ignorance of where other hospitals are buying their goods and for how much. This relates also to the States. The Committee found a great deal of support for centralising purchasing within the CTHC, but so far nothing has been done.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has recommended that a more careful analysis be made of the buying of goods rather than leasing or hiring. There is a temptation to lease because of short term advantages, whilst committing the Commonwealth to high long term payments. For example, the Committee estimated that for the major brand of photocopiers used in the Public Service, the saving by buying rather than leasing would be $1.4m over the life of the machines. There are also recommendations on program effectiveness. The Government has a commendable policy of giving preference to Australian-made goods to aid industry recovery, increase employment and improve productivity. However, the Committee felt there were problems. For instance: Firstly, protection provided is small in aggregate; secondly, it discriminates in favour of industries which are major government suppliers; thirdly, it does not focus on employment; fourthly, the costs of policy are unknown and, fifthly, it has not been subject to in-depth review.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee believes there is an urgent need both for improvements in the collection of information on benefits and costs of Australian preference and for a detailed review of the impact of these programs. The Committee has been concerned for suppliers of goods to the Commonwealth, especially small businesses. The Committee has recommended that unsuccessful tenderers be advised more thoroughly as to why they were unsuccessful. The Committee has also recommended two-phase tendering be introduced so that every firm does not have to supply detailed tenders initially.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee also inquired into the payment of accounts for purchasers and felt that, through a previous Government instruction, this process had been shortened. Other recommendations simplify and shorten procedures, thereby reducing staff requirements; for example, revised quality control procedures which would reduce Government inspections and place a greater reliance on the firm's quality control. Again I pay tribute to the co-operation of the Committee members and of those witnesses who appeared before it in the genuine hope, I believe, that answers and suggestions could be given to improve this major part of Government involvement.

        —by leave-I commend this report to the Government. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has spoken at length on the recommendations in the report, and I believe he should be congratulated on producing such an excellent report. He is the longest serving member of a rather lengthy inquiry. When one looks at the members who have come and gone from the Standing Committee on Expenditure over the years the inquiry has continued, it is obvious that the honourable member for Dawson would know more about government purchasing than most people presently in this Parliament. As has been said earlier, this report points out most vividly that purchasing on behalf of the Commonwealth Government is in an absolute shambles, and no department shows that more than the Department of Defence. I believe that the Committee's report highlights the same problems in the Department of Defence as those shown by the Katter Sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I think that the sooner the Government tightens up the procedures of Commonwealth Government purchasing, the sooner the wastage in that area of Commonwealth expenditure will be removed. I conclude my remarks by congratulating Bob Harlow, the Expenditure Committee officer who finally put together the report. That work will stand as an example of some of the good work parliamentary committees can do to assist the Government and the bureaucracy to fulfil their functions.

         —by leave-This report fol- lows the decision by the Committee, in November 1979, to inquire into 'The changing power structure in Indo-China since 1975 and its effects on Australia and the region'. Sub-Committee A undertook the reference and, in the course of the inquiry, submissions were received and evidence heard from a wide variety of individuals and representatives of organisations. These include nationals and diplomatic representatives of the Indo-Chinese countries, Australian academics with expert knowledge of the region, representatives of Commonwealth departments, and United Nations representatives. Five members of Sub-Committee A individually visited the region between 1979 and 1981, which has provided the Committee with valuable first-hand information, especially regarding the refugee situation and conditions in Kampuchea.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the Committee's recommendations in the report tabled today is that the Government should encourage further and continuous study of this volatile region, which is likely to become more important to Australia's future. In this way, the Australian public can become aware of the many political, military, social and economic factors contributing to the present instability of the region, and public interest in events in the region will be stimulated.
       </para>
       <para>
        The very large Indo-Chinese refugee problem which has arisen in recent years has had direct consequences for Australia since over 50,000 Indo-Chinese refugees have been accepted for resettlement here since 1975. The humanitarian aspects of the Indo-Chinese refugee situation, and Australia's role in assisting the refugees, is currently being examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and has not been studied in depth by this Committee. The existence of a very large body of refugees is also a major cause of instability in the region, particularly in the Thai-Kampuchean border area. The Committee therefore recommends that, working through United Nations organisations, the Government should press for the establishment of some form of administrative machinery on the Thai-Kampuchean border so that those refugees seeking a new life in another country can quickly and permanently be separated from short-term refugees who intend returning to Kampuchea.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Indo-Chinese refugee problem is a tragic by-product of the recent political and military upheavals in the region, which are documented in the report tabled today. The most widely known of these events is the virtual destruction of Kampuechea's social fabric, as a direct result of the policies of the Democratic Kampuchean Government-better known as the Pol Pot regime. Between April 1975 and the end of 1978, it would appear that the DK leaders caused the deaths by massacre or starvation of as many as one to two million Kampucheans. Also, the events taking place in Kampuchea resulted in large numbers of Kampuchean refugees fleeing to Thailand and Vietnam. The report notes that there have been few regimes this century so reviled as the so-called DK Government. The Committee recommends that the general abhorrence felt in Australia towards that regime should be kept in mind when considering Australia's attitude towards the Indo-Chinese region, and that Australia should discourage diplomatic support for the Democratic Kampuchean regime. The Committee does not, however, support the recognition of the People's Republic of Kampuchea-Heng Samrin-whilst Vietnamese military forces are present in Kampuchea.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the overthrow of the DK Government in January 1979, there was a new outflow of Kampuchean refugees into Thailand. The movement of Kampucheans towards the Thai border greatly increased in the second half of 1979, after the onset of a disastrous famine in their devastated country. By the end of 1979, there were over a quarter of a million Indo-Chinese refugees and displaced persons in Thailand, including 119,000 Kampucheans who arrived in the last months of the year. In addition, approximately another quarter of a million Kampucheans were camped near the Thai-Kampuchean border. In recent months, the international relief agencies and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations-FAO-have expressed a belief that the worst of the food shortages in Kampuchea may now be over. The country is still far from self-sufficient in food production, but, due largely to the international aid effort in 1979-80, the food situation has greatly improved. This improvement is reflected in the fact that, in recent months, people have been returning to their farms and villages from the temporary settlements along the Thai-Kampuchean border. However, the FAO's reports have stressed that the country's economy is still so fragile that famine conditions could easily return if drought or floods occur, or as a result of political or military upheavals, or if there is an abrupt end to international aid.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interests of encouraging stability in the region, every effort needs to be made by the international community to prevent the re-occurrence of famine in Kampuchea. The Committee therefore recommends that Australian humanitarian aid to Kampuchea should continue. The refugee problem that has arisen in the last six years is also related to events in Vietnam and Laos, and to policies adopted by the governments of those countries. These policies and their consequences are described in the report tabled today. Over 100,000 Laotians had fled their country by the end of 1977, and the outflow has continued since then. In 1978, nearly 200,000 Vietnamese of Chinese origin fled over the Vietnamese border into China, while almost 90,000 Vietnamese boat people, among whom Vietnamese of Chinese origin predominated, arrived in South East Asia that year, followed by a further 160,000 in the first half of 1979. The exodus of Vietnamese-Chinese by land and sea in 1978 and 1979 brought accusations from the international community that the Vietnamese Government was deliberately and callously driving out the country's Vietnamese-Chinese minority. As a result of international criticism, the Vietnamese Government undertook to reduce the outflow of boat people, and the numbers leaving by sea dropped substantially in the second half of 1979. Since mid-1980 the numbers of boat people reaching countries of first asylum in South East Asia began to rise again, and this trend has continued in 1981. According to figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, approximately 11,150 Vietnamese fled in April, compared with 5,154 in March.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most notable developments in Indo-China since 1975 is the emergence of Vietnam as a strong military power. This development is one of the main causes of the present instability in the region, and has tremendous potential for causing instability in the future. The Committee recommends that any Australian foreign or domestic policy decisions concerning future developments in the region should take into account the existence and capacity of this power. Vietnam's emergence as a military power has also been responsible for a near breakdown in its relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations, especially Thailand. Vietnamese forces have clashed with Thai troops a number of times in the ill-defined Thai-Kampuchean border area, and both sides engaged in heavy fighting during the Vietnamese military incursion into Thailand in June 1980. Prolonged confrontation has not yet occurred between the opposing forces along the border. However, as long as Thai and Vietnamese forces continue to face each other across the border there is a constant possibility of renewed armed conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently, there has also been a resurgence of serious fighting in the Sino-Vietnamese border, where China is currently reported to have some 250,000 troops deployed, and Vietnam a similar number. As the report tabled today indicates, Vietnam is apparently determined to maintain its present domination of Indo-China, even at the cost of conflict with China. Under the so-called Twenty-five Year Treaties of Friendship and Co-operation signed with Laos in July 1979 and Kampuchea in February 1979, Vietnam has legitimised her military presence in those countries, under the guise of defence co-operation. Currently, there are 40,000 to 50,000 Vietnamese troops in Laos and some 200,000 troops in Kampuchea. Consequently, Laos and Kampuchea must now be regarded as client states of their powerful neighbour. The Committee is concerned at this situation and recommends that Australia should support policies which would result in the independence of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea, based on democratically elected governments. The Committee also recommends that economic aid should not be given by Australia to Vietnam until it withdraws its military forces from Laos and Kampuchea.
       </para>
       <para>
        Vietnam's domination of Indo-China entails her continuing dependence on the Soviet Union for large-scale military and economic aid. The Soviet Union has been able to utilise its relationship with Vietnam to obtain access to port facilities and thus increase its own presence in the region. The physical presence of Soviet advisers in Vietnam and the Soviet naval presence, particularly in such major ports as Da Nang, appears to have expanded considerably since February 1979. Vietnam has apparently become an important staging-cum-naval observation post or depot for Soviet naval operations in the South China Sea. To China, this no doubt appears part of what is seen as a Soviet plot to encircle her on all possible borders. A reduction in the tensions in the Indo-Chinese region will not be achieved easily. The Committee believes, therefore, that Australia must face the prospect of continued instability in the region, coupled with the very real prospect of renewed armed conflict there.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommends that Australia should make strenuous efforts to promote regional solutions to Indo-Chinese problems and, in the interest of peace and stability in the region, attempt to decrease the involvement of the super-powers. The Committee further recommends that the Government should utilise its relationship with ASEAN to encourage all forms of dialogue between ASEAN countries and Indo-China which may help decrease tension in the region and promote a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Kampuchea. Australia should also continue to lend its support to international efforts aimed at decreasing regional tension.

         —by leave-I think the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is well worthy of note. As with most committees of this Parliament there are a large number of areas of agreement among the membership of this Committee. There is agreement by all members of the Committee on a bipartisan basis of the denunciation of the Pol Pot regime of Democratic Kampuchea. I think that is recognised in recommendation No. 4 of the report. There is also bipartisan support for and bipartisan statements on condemning the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea. I point out that as far as the Opposition is concerned the invasion of any other country, whether it be of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union or the raids carried out yesterday by Israeli forces on Iraq, is to be condemned. I think that point is registered in the report as far as the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea is concerned.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is also agreement that the Heng Samrin regime in Kampuchea is dependent on the continued presence of Vietnamese forces. In Committee discussions there was a slight difference in emphasis on how we should handle the question of the Heng Samrin regime. My colleague the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) moved a motion in the Committee, which I was very happy to support, stating that the recognition of the Heng Samrin Government ought not to be entertained at this stage, that clear evidence should be presented that the Heng Samrin regime is independently capable of controlling Kampuchea before such recognition was granted. I believe that was a very sensible motion. It was in slight contradistinction to the recommendation that was carried and included in the Committee report. All in all the areas of agreement were large. The one area in which there was difference was on the question of resuming aid to Vietnam. This is in curious distinction to the position taken on the continued humanitarian aid to Kampuchea. We certainly see some contradiction in the views of Committee members on this subject.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to draw the House's attention to the dissenting report on recommendation No. 3 which starts at page 93 of the report. I point out that the dissenting report was signed by one of the Government members of the Committee-Senator Sim. What we were seeking to do in that dissenting report was to point out that although the decision to terminate the aid program to Vietnam was understandable-it was only a very small aid program-we believe by the continuance of that policy we will deny Australia an identifiable position in the discussions and negotiations which will have to be undertaken in order to bring a sense of peace and a resolution of the very complex problem in the Indo-China area. I commend to the House the consideration of the dissenting report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think some matters of grave concern flow from the report. One that is particularly topical is the attempt by the Singaporean Government to create a third force. I noticed in the newspaper today a report of a threat by the Singaporean Minister for Foreign Affairs which is directly relevant to the matters discussed in the report of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. It was reported that if Australia did not vote in favour of the Pol Pot regime that would be a black mark, to use Mr Rajaratnam's phrase, against Australia. The Committee report indicated that back on 4 February Singapore is alleged to have asked Australia to provide active support for the third force. That support was to be in the form of money and arms. It was an attempt to create a force to counter the Heng Samrin regime by military means. First of all, we can say that no such official approach was received, and the report underlines that fact. If such a request were ever received I hope that the Australian Government would treat it with the contempt it deserves.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report categorically states in recommendation No. 4, after pointing out the abhorrence felt in Australia for the Pol Pot regime of Democratic Kampuchea, that we should discourage diplomatic support for the Democratic Kampuchean regime. I hope that the Government will take note of the recommendation that we should take no actions in the international field to give any support or succour to the Pol Pot regime. This will be a complete denial of the propositions put forward by Singapore. I do not think we are being anti-ASEAN-that is, the Association of South East Asian Nations-when we take that position because it is well known that Singapore and Thailand take a particular position in relation to Kampuchea. This position within the ASEAN context is not shared by Malaysia and Indonesia, which countries have very grave reservations about the proposals put forward by the Singaporean Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think one of our other concerns is the ambivalent position of the Australian Government in relation to its policy on Kampuchea. On 14 October 1980 Australia cast a deceptive, certainly misleading, vote in the United Nations where the Australian delegation was instructed to vote for the credentials of the Pol Pot regime. In fact this meant that for the succeeding year until the next meeting of the credentials committee of the United Nations-in September or October this year-Australia will have continued to give international respectability to the Pol Pot regime. The Government has stated in international forums that it will not vote for the Pol Pot regime. I point out that by the Government's vote back in October 1980 it has committed itself to that course. It has taken that position and I hope it will continue to observe it. Its position has not yet been tested. I think the Government, in light of the recommendations of this bipartisan Committee report, should act in conformity with the abhorrence expressed in the report for the Pol Pot regime of Democratic Kampuchea and with its view that we should not provide diplomatic support for the continued recognition of the Pol Pot regime.

         —by leave-I will confine my comments to the interpretative aspects of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which were the most controversial and on which the Committee was most divided. I have a particular interest in the recognition issue because I think I was the first member of this Parliament to call for Australia to withdraw its recognition of the Pol Pot regime. I did this in the form of a question to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) in the House of Representatives on 29 April 1976. My call for derecognition was based on the horrendous atrocities being committed by that regime. It seems to me that we have an enormous problem in establishing criteria for recognition, and maintaining consistency in the application of such criteria. At the moment there appears to be a constant dilemma between granting or withdrawing recognition on pragmatic grounds-based on whether or not a certain government or regime is in control of a country-or granting or withdrawing recognition on moral grounds, that is, whether or not a particular government is acting humanely and according basic human rights to its citizens. If it is not, should we apply our own standards and perceptions to that regime when considering our diplomatic relationship to it?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It seems to me that if we apply one principle to the total exclusion of the other, we are in some difficulty and if we apply a combination of both we can be seen to be inconsistent. For example, if we derecognise Pol Pot-as I have long believed we should-on moral grounds, perhaps one could legitimately ask: 'Where does one draw the line?' Totalitarian governments of the Left and the Right account for most of the governments around the world. They are governments such as that in the Soviet Union which do not grant basic human rights to their citizens. If we apply this moral principle exclusively we would recognise very few countries at all, which might be unwise on both diplomatic and strategic grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, do we recognise a government which, whether we approve of it or not, does happen to be in control of a particular country? If so, why is the Government of Taiwan not recognised, or the previous Administration in Rhodesia? After all, the regime in Taipeh is the Government of Taiwan and has perpetrated much less undesirable policies than, say, Pol Pot whom we have long continued to recognise. I am not advocating recognition of any particular nation. All I am saying is that we appear to be inconsistent in our approach to this whole question. This poses a serious dilemma which should be canvassed by this Parliament. Adherence to any one principle at the exclusion of others certainly creates difficulties. If recognition is based solely on moral grounds it can ignore our best foreign policy and political interests. If it is based solely on whether or not a regime effectively controls a particular country, then this can offend our moral sensibilities and harm our own political interests at the same time. If we are to grant recognition firmly in accordance with one criterion or another, very fine judgment will be required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the old adage that there are no permanent friends, no permanent enemies and no permanent alliances but only permanent interests is the best and most practical guiding principle in such matters. The Committee's recommendation No. 4, in which it is basically said that Australia should not recognise any regime in Kampuchea at present, has my support and certainly seems sensibly to embrace both of the recognition principles I have mentioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter of aid to Vietnam was the subject of a dissenting report. I support recommendation 3 of the report. I say this for a number of reasons, most of which are contained in the report. Firstly, as stated in the report, Vietnam has frequently been referred to as the Prussia or Sparta of Indo-China. In fact in proportion to its population Vietnam has one of the largest armed forces in the world; secondly, Vietnam has some 200,000 troops still in Kampuchea; thirdly, Vietnam has 40,000 to 50,000 troops in Laos; fourthly, increasing military and economic aid has been given to Vietnam by the Soviet Union which is now re-equipping and re-arming the Vietnamese armed forces; and fifthly, Vietnam, following its reunification after some 40 years of warfare which had destroyed the country's economic infrastructure, made a conscious decision of its own to further its military imperialism in the area at the expense of economic development and the furthering of the living standards of its people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given these reasons, together with the fact that Vietnam deliberately destroyed an important base of its economy by expelling the Chinese middle-class-the nation's merchants and entrepreneurs-and given that our report states that the economic aid it now receives from the Soviet Union has allowed it to divert its domestic national resources to military expansion, I find it impossible to justify Australia's giving economic aid to Vietnam. More aid would simply allow Vietnam to divert more resources to military expansion in the region, with the endorsement and support of the Soviet Union. To give economic aid under these circumstances to a country over which we have no influence, to a country which has itself decided to give priority to military expansion rather than economic development and to a country which has strategic interests clearly against our own best interests in the region, would be absurd. I therefore support the Committee's recommendation not to give aid to Vietnam.

         —by leave-I would like to add a few words to the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I am one of those whose views on the derecognition of Pol Pot preceded those of the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean). I opposed the original recognition back in 1975.

        It is important to note that the report was unanimous on all recommendations except recommendation No. 3. Whilst there was some disagreement, not so much on the original Sub-committee but on the full Committee, the members of the Committee as a whole presented a dissenting report only on the question of aid. Let me make my position quite clear on that matter. I would support aid if I thought for one minute that it would lead to a split between Vietnam and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or even to a withdrawal from Kampuchea and Laos by the Vietnamese. I believe there is no evidence whatsoever for this hope. I think at present our aid to that area is being given to the thousands of refugees from Indo-China many of whom are still in refugee camps. Large numbers have come to Australia.

        The question of the recognition of the Heng Samrin regime has not produced a minority report, I believe the people who support the recognition of Heng Samrin in Vietnam are the same people who gave us Stalin, Pol Pot and the Ayatollah Khomeini. Every time they thought they were improving the set-up in the country. They thought they were improving the situation in the Soviet Union by supporting Stalin, they thought they were improving the situation in Kampuchea by imposing Pol Pot on the country and they thought they were improving the situation in Iran by supporting the Ayatollah. In many cases within a very short time of those people taking over in those countries it became quite clear that they were changes for the worst. Very few people would now argue-I do not think anybody in the Australian Labor Party would argue-that Stalin was an improvement on Kerensky and, after all, the communists overthrew Kerensky and not the czar; very few people would argue that Pol Pot was an improvement on the type of government in position in Kampuchea or that the Ayatollah was an improvement on the Shah, however bad the previous rulers were.

        I think that appeasement has not paid off vis-a-vis aggressors. It did not pay off before the Second World War and it has not paid off since the Second World War. I strongly support the proposition that we give no aid to countries if they behave in an aggressive fashion towards their neighbours.

         —South-west Tasmania, including the wild rivers area of the Gordon, Franklin and Olga systems, is arguably Australia's most beautiful area and it is certainly our last great wilderness. The Franklin River, Australia's last wild river, runs from the Cheyne Range across flats, around 5,000 feet mountain peaks, through 3,000 feet gorges and turbulent rapids to the Gordon River and to the sea. I have been to the area four times since last December. Already the upper Gordon has been flooded and so has Lake Pedder. Now a new Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission integrated hydro scheme is proposed to flood the Franklin River and the lower Gordon in ignorance of its grandeur in the best Hydro-Electric Commission tradition that no Tasmanian river, regardless of its environmental value, shall flow to the sea without first passing through a power turbine. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has previously recognised the value of this wilderness to the nation and to the world.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps you could call these Tasmanian recalcitrants to order so that they might learn something about their own State. They are in complete opposition to their own Prime Minister. In 1978 the Prime Minister contacted the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Lowe, advising that nominations were being called for the World Heritage List. He suggested that south-west Tasmania be considered for listing. After a long time-I admit it was a long time-the Tasmanian Government advised the Prime Minister last year that the request had been acceded to. Now the Tasmanian Government has gone one step further and has proclaimed an extension to the South West National Park along the Franklin River which is to be named the Franklin Wild Rivers National Park. It is expected that this area will also be added to the south-west nomination for the World Heritage List.

       <para>
        Despite the delays, two clear facts emerge. Honourable members should take note of them. The Prime Minister says he wants the south-west of Tasmania to be part of the World Heritage List-correctly so-and the Tasmanian Government agrees with him. But a political crisis has erupted in Tasmania to match the environmental crisis which has resulted from the Hydro-Electric Commission's plans to dam the Gordon River below the Franklin River. Despite the apparent agreement between the Federal Government and the Tasmanian Government, the Tasmanian Opposition, using its stooges who are in the majority in the Upper House, has set out clearly to frustrate the wishes of an elected State government to save the Franklin River by imposing an environmentally destructive HEC plan upon Tasmania and Australia. What is the Federal Government's position now? What initiatives has it taken? What initiatives has the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) taken, given the environmental value of the area and given a clear Federal Government involvement resulting from its requirement to authorise the immense Loan Council borrowing programs that will be needed to construct the dams? Tasmania is split four ways. Honourable members opposite who are trying to interject, such as the deposed Minister and the little Aussie battler who does not even know what is going on in his State, should listen to this for a change.

I do not think the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment who is sitting opposite me will have had time to acclimatise himself. Tasmania is split four ways. The conservationists want no more dams. The Hydro-Electric Commission's integrated plan involves three dams, one on the Gordon below the Franklin, one on the upper Franklin and one on the King River. The Government proposes to dam the Gordon above the Olga and the King River at a later stage. The fourth option is the amendment to the Government's proposals by the Upper House which has proposed a variation of the hydro scheme which involves the damming of the Gordon below the Franklin. That is essentially the same as stage one of the hydro scheme.

       <para>
        It is very interesting to examine the huge capital investments involved. These commitments compare with a very low comparative power output. I will give honourable members the figures. The total hydro scheme would cost approximately $810m in real terms to produce only 340 megawatts of power. It would flood the Gordon River for 37 kilometres above the Franklin and would flood the lower Franklin for 35 kilometres. The Government's scheme would cost $611m to produce 180 megawatts of power. The select committee's program, which still involves the damming of the Franklin, would cost approximately $650m and produce only 230 megawatts. The unit cost of energy from the Government's proposal is only 0.22c a unit more than the upper House program. I will give a cost comparison with coal-fired power generation. The power stations at Eraring, Bayswater and Mount Piper in New South Wales will cost an all-up total of $2.6 billion and produce 6,600 megawatts of power. Loy Yang A and B power stations in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria will cost $3.2 billion and produce over 4,000 megawatts of power.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are unanswered questions regarding Tasmania's future power requirements and the capacity of hydro-electric schemes to meet them. Tasmania's average current power output is now 1,033 megawatts. After completion of the Pieman scheme for a cost of over $500m, a further meagre 135 megawatts will be added to make a total capacity of 1,168 megawatts. The upper House scheme would add a mere 230 megawatts giving a total capacity of 1,400 megawatts. The Government's scheme would give a total Tasmanian capacity of 1,340 megawatts. The integrated hydro scheme, if completed, would give the State 1,500 megawatts of power in all. The Hydro-Electric Commission forecasts a total Tasmanian requirement of 1,650 megawatts within 20 years. If the Commission's assessments are correct, even if it has its way and floods the Franklin, the Gordon, the King and every other dam and creek in Tasmania, there will still be a shortfall on its own estimation by the year 2000 A.D. The Directorate of Energy in Tasmania has produced a report that the Hydro-Electric Commission is greatly underestimating the demand for electricity, particularly future bulk industrial use. If the Directorate of Energy is correct, there could be an even larger shortfall even if the Franklin were dammed. On the other hand, those who favour no more dams and a policy of co-generation, including the use of the 370,000 tonnes per year of wood wastes, energy conservation and perhaps thermal power, argue that the Hydro-Electric Commission's figures are grossly over-stated and involve an exaggerated HEC projection rate of increase of 7 per cent a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are three separate positions. The Directorate of Energy is saying that Tasmania needs more power than the Hydro-Electric Commission estimates, the Commission is taking the middle ground and the conservationists are on the base line taking basically a no-growth position. The conservationists could be right. On the other hand, the Directorate of Energy could be right. There needs to be an inquiry. The conservationists say that in 1970 the Hydro-Electric Commission predicted a need for almost 1,500 megawatts of power by 1980 and that that was a projection error over the last 10 years of almost 50 per cent. Those are facts and figures. Either the HEC's projections are grossly over-estimated and the proposed expensive low power yield hydro schemes are unnecessary, or the HEC and the even more bullish State Directorate of Energy are correct. That would mean that hydro power in Tasmania would have a limited scope in satisfying rising demand and in no way could satisfy Tasmania's requirements. If this is true, perhaps now is the time to break with hydro power and look at alternatives such as conservation, co-generation, thermal power stations and an undersea cable from Victoria delivering power as part of an interstate energy grid.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a very strong case on environmental, economic and employment grounds to develop either a 200 or 400 megawatt coal-fired power station in northern Tasmania using local coal from the Fingal Valley or imported coal from New South Wales. Current economically recoverable reserves in Tasmania are approximately 130 million tonnes. The demand for a 400 megawatt power station is 1.5 million tonnes of coal per year. Such a station could be constructed for $240m. It could be expected to employ 300 people during the construction period and provide 120 permanent operational jobs compared with only 30 permanent jobs for the HEC's integrated scheme. Although hydro power is cheaper than coal-fired power, over a long period this is greatly offset by the hydro power's greater capital costs and the increased long term employment opportunities with coal-fired power. Last December the State Liberal dominated upper House amended the State legislation put up by the Tasmanian Government by seeking to impose its own scheme to dam the Gordon and Franklin Rivers.

I said also that the hydro-integrated scheme, which the upper House wishes to implement, must not proceed in Tasmania. We have heard arguments-I have no doubt that I will hear them from the Minister-that the Government should not intervene in Tasmania, that this is a State issue. We do not agree with that. Whatever scheme is passed in Tasmania, that Government will be requiring funds from this Federal Parliament through the Loan Council, or it will be requiring Federal assistance to compensate for the saving of the wild rivers area. Those are clearly matters that should be determined by Federal inquiry.

        Another option, which could be the long term answer, is an interstate power grid to link Tasmania with three mainland States. This would obviate the necessity for each State electricity commission to construct its own electricity empire based upon providing for maximum peak demands. A proposal from the Institute of Engineers is currently being studied by the Ziedler committee. That proposal suggests that reserve capacity in four States could be reduced by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of maximum demand and total savings of some 2,500 megawatts could be introduced in four States in the next decade; that is, a power station the size of Eraring in New South Wales, or over seven times the output of the entire Hydro-Electric Commission integrated scheme in Tasmania-the destroyer of the Franklin River. If we linked up the Latrobe Valley with Bell Bay by undersea cable as part of such a scheme, this would cost approximately $230m. I repeat that it would cost $230m to save the Franklin and $810m to flood it.

        We are dealing now with a subject of immense importance-the energy and economic future of Tasmania, the need for rationalisation of our eastern States' electricity system, and the need to preserve a magnificent area of national and world significance. We have a federal Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act which allows the Federal Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, who is sitting at the table, to set up a public inquiry to examine developments of national significance or where the Commonwealth has an interest through the issue of export licences or Loan Council funds. After all, if any new hydro scheme proceeds in Tasmania the Loan Council will provide the majority of funds.

        There is a need to save south-west Tasmania, and it has all of these federal connotations. The Opposition knows that the Prime Minister and the Government are on record as wishing to save south-west Tasmania for the appreciation of many generations of future Australians. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment supports a Federal inquiry; so does the Opposition and, from my information, so does the Government of Tasmania. Now that the Tasmanian Opposition has attempted to flood the Franklin on two occasions there should be a Federal inquiry to assess once and for all Tasmania's future energy needs, the best way of satisfying them, and whether the people of Australia-besides the people of Tasmania-want to save the Gordon-Franklin system for all time. Mr Deputy Speaker and Tasmanian members of Federal Parliament, let the Franklin River run wild and free.

         —In this matter of public importance the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) has drawn attention to the beauties of south-west Tasmania. There is no argument about the environmental value of south-west Tasmania. Only recently the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in response to a question from the honourable member for Cunningham, reaffimed the Government's view when he said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The south-western wilderness area is land of great beauty. It is unique; it is irreplaceable.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope it can be listed on the World Heritage list.
       </para>
       <para>
        He pointed out that in his view it was a good thing that Mr Lowe, the Premier of Tasmania, had made a decision to seek the nomination of this area on the World Heritage list. The area is part of a national park.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth has taken a number of steps in recognition of the value of south-west Tasmania. In particular, we have consistently maintained that the Government is prepared to assist Tasmania to establish in south-west Tasmania a national park of world significance. We have listed south-west Tasmania in the register of the National Estate, and the effect of that registration is to impose obligations on Commonwealth Ministers and authorities. The House would be aware, of course, that that legislation does not impose any legal obligation on State or local authorities. That is a matter for the Government of Tasmania to determine. We have suggested-we are pleased to know from the Tasmanian Government that it now agrees with us-that south-west Tasmania should be nominated on the World Heritage List.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Tasmanian Government is unsure about what it wants to do in this area. It has not made up its mind as to the values it places upon south-west Tasmania. The honourable member for Cunningham, in bringing forward this matter of public importance for debate today, and in urging this Government to set up an inquiry when a whole range of other inquiries are already going on, is trying to camouflage the Tasmanian Government's desire to proceed with a hydro-electric proposal. At the same time, he is seeking support from many whose concerns are far broader than that, who would like to see the whole area brought within a national park and placed on the World Heritage List.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within the Commonwealth of Australia, land use decisions are largely matters for State governments. This issue is primarily a matter of concern for Tasmania. At the present time Tasmania has not made a final decision as to what it wants to do in terms of land usage in the area of south-west Tasmania. In recognising the great value of that area from an environmental point of view, the Commonwealth has given support to Tasmania in its provision of $350,000 for a resources survey. The object of that resources survey is to provide a basis for future decision making by the Tasmanian Government in the administration and management of the area, including the wilderness values which may require reservation and management as a national park. The Government has assisted also in the commissioning of aerial photography of the area to assist in the definition of key habitats for endangered fauna and flora and by funding some research into the ecology of the lakes in the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final report of the resources survey is expected to be relaxed in the near future. When that survey has been released, all governments, according to their responsibilities, can then make a determination as to the future moves they might wish to make taking into account the information that is brought to our attention in that survey. It will be a matter of great interest to the Commonwealth to learn from the Tasmanian Government its assessment of that report. Further Commonwealth assistance for the management and administration of the park has been requested by the Tasmanian Government. The Commonwealth has undertaken to consider these requests by the Tasmanian Government in respect of specific proposals associated with the protection of the region when the report of the resources survey has been assessed. Concerning the proposed hydro-electric development in south-west Tasmania it should be appreciated, as I have already mentioned, that land management and land use decisions are generally matters for State governments, except where Commonwealth-owned land is involved. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, believes that the decisions on the development of State-owned land in south-west Tasmania are largely the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation tabled its report in August 1980 on south-west Tasmania and hydro-power development. The Committee, amongst other things, recommended that the Commonwealth seek advice as to whether the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 applies to proposed hydro-electric developments in south-west Tasmania and, if there were such proposals as defined under the Act, that the Act be invoked. The Government is considering these recommendations and in due course an announcement will be made to the Parliament on the outcome of the Government's considerations. But, as Tasmania indicates to us its views as to what it is proposing to do, those changed views of the Tasmanian Government need to be taken into account.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable gentlemen will be aware of the continuing uncertainty in Tasmania on which a hydro-electric power proposal, if any, is to proceed. Pending resolution of differences between the two Houses of Parliament, it is quite proper, I believe, that the Commonwealth should reserve its decision until it knows what the Tasmanian Government has in mind. On 30 April 1981 the Premier of Tasmania advised that the Franklin-Lower Gordon-Wild Rivers National Park had been proclaimed. This park encompasses areas of the Franklin and Olga Rivers as well as the lower part of the Gordon River. In addition, the proclamation provides for the extension of the south-west national park to include the catchment area of the Davey River. It would appear that this proclamation has excluded one of the hydro-electric options under consideration-the one favoured by the Tasmanian upper House.
       </para>
       <para>
        The area affected by the Gordon above Olga proposal has not yet been included by the Tasmanian Government in the area either within the south-west Tasmanian national park or the wild rivers national park. The honourable member for Cunningham did not indicate whether he believes that that area should be included in one of those parks. So he brings before this Parliament a matter of public importance on the pretence that he is concerned about the whole of the south-west Tasmania region and then spends a large part of his time in support of a hydro-electric development proposal in the Olga above Gordon section of the river.

         —At the present time it is a matter for the Tasmanian Government to determine what its own policies are with regard to its energy future. That is true of other States. When they have development projects in mind they determine their own priorities. When they have made their decisions, and there is an involvement by the Commonwealth Government as a result of those decisions, it is then proper for the Commonwealth to give concern under its own legislation and to take into account the national interest. So what the honourable member for Cunningham is endeavouring to do is to move from Tasmania a decision which is a decision for the Tasmanian Parliament, the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people. When they have made up their minds what course of action they wish to take in this regard it will be proper for that decision to be assessed in the manner that takes into account the Commonwealth's legislation.

         —If they are being frustrated they are being frustrated in accordance with the appropriate political processes applying within Tasmania. In view of the continuing uncertainty as to the intentions and the capacity of the Tasmanian Government about the future in south-west Tasmania, it has not been appropriate to respond to the recommendations following the inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives committee. To date there is no proposal. If the Tasmanians were to find that their energy needs were not dependent on hydro-development in the region there would be no circumstance which would give rise to the question of the applicability of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. It would be interesting to learn what environmental value Tasmania places on the south-west wilderness area and its views as to the appropriate way of preserving the area. I was interested to hear that it had extended the south-west park and had declared the wild rivers park.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is up to Tasmania to determine whether it has in mind proceeding with the hydro-electric proposal in the Gordon above Olga area, and when that decision is taken it will be proper for the Commonwealth to consider its position. Of course, Tasmania, like the Commonwealth, is awaiting the outcome of the report of the committee looking into energy resources in south-east Australia. Whilst this report is directly concerned with the possibility of further integrating existing and planned electricity systems between the States, the further development of electricity supply systems within a particular State are also being considered. The committee's report may have a significant bearing on the future power development proposals in Tasmania and the economic, social and environmental impacts of possible alternatives including the linking the Tasmanian power grid with the mainland grid and matters of energy conservation.

        The failure of the Government to instigate a Federal inquiry into the environmental value to Tasmania and Australia of its South-West Wilderness area and the most appropriate way of preserving the area consistent with Tasmanian State development.

What the Government is concerned to do is to recognise in the way that we have in the past the important environmental value of the whole of the south-west Tasmania region. We have set in motion inquiries such as the inquiry into energy in south-east Australia. We have provided funds for Tasmania to carry out resource investigations. We have urged the Tasmanian Government to list the whole area on the World Heritage list. So the ball is very much in the court of the Tasmanian people and the Tasmanian Parliament and, through the Tasmanian Parliament, the Tasmanian Government. So until the Tasmanian Government comes forward with a proposal, it is not appropriate for the Commonwealth to indicate what its views are. When a proposal comes forward that involves any development in south-west Tasmania that is the time for an assessment to be made as to the effect of that development on that wonderful rivers area in south-west Tasmania.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Provision of army housing at Townsville, Qld.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal is to provide 120 married quarters for soldiers of the Third Task Force. The need for this housing results from the Government's decision to expand the Task Force to carry out its new function as an operational deployment force. In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee has indicated its acceptance of the need for additional housing in Townsville and has recommended the construction of these 120 houses subject to the reservations expressed in its report. The Committee has made a number of comments and specific recommendations in its conclusions and throughout the body of its report has made several other observations. These recommendations and observations not only concern the Townsville project but provide constructive comment for administrators in the provision of defence housing generally throughout the Commonwealth. They relate amongst other things to the provision of some villa type medium density housing; the need for liaison with representatives of Service families about defence scales and standards and the need for putting more emphasis on safety, comfort and variety of design for Service housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can assure the Committee and this House that careful consideration will be given to the views expressed throughout the report both for the Townsville project and housing projects generally. The estimated cost of the proposal examined by the Committee was $5.35m at February 1981 prices. The Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference and if the House agrees to support this motion, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.

       That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Australian Antarctic bases.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposal is for the progressive replacement of buildings and the provision of facilities needed to support current research programs in Australia's Antarctic Territory. The redevelopment will be carried out over a 10-year period and will involve replacement of accommodation which is sub-standard and whose structure has deteriorated to a state where continued maintenance is no longer economical or practicable. The replacement of buildings will occur at Casey, Mawson and Davis stations. The proposal comprises construction or replacement of facilities including: Living and sleeping quarters; store, workshop and administration buildings; laboratories and scientific support facilities; powerhouses; engineering services including electricity reticulation; water supply and sewage disposal; and general siteworks.
      </para>
      <para>
       In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee has made one recommendation that the timing of the construction of the recreation buildings for Mawson and Davis be put back from the 1984-85 program year to 1986-87. The purpose of this change is to give higher priority to scientific buildings and the Committee's recommendation is acceptable to the Government. It is noted that in the body of its report the Committee has made a number of useful observations. They include reference to such topics as the use of hydroponics in the stations, questions of air travel and wharfage facilities and conditions of service in Antarctica. These matters have been noted and will be further considered in the development of the construction program. The estimated cost of the civil works component of the proposal examined by the Committee was $35m. Additional costs of $23.14m will be incurred for plant and equipment, logistic support and shipping. The Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.

         —I have been given the responsibility for the carriage of the Statute Law Revision Bill on behalf of the Opposition. The Opposition supports the legislation. I am privileged to be followed in this debate by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). The honourable member for Holt is one of the most eminent barristers in Australia, particularly on constitutional and statute law. The Statute Law Revision Bill is a welcome measure in this era of proliferation in statute law. As the legislative output of Acts and regulations expands, the ordinary citizen is becoming increasingly concerned with the effects of statutes on his life, his business and his employment. The legislative process assumes compliance with laws once enacted, and for compliance to be a reasonable expectation the minimum requirements for legislation are that it should be, firstly, accurate and up to date and, secondly, intelligible and certain of interpretation. I say that these are the minimum requirements. Honourable members are aware of how often one or other of those requirements is not met. This Bill goes some way towards meeting those requirements. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has indicated that statute law revision Bills will be introduced on a regular basis, at least once a year, and this should contribute to the maintenance of an accurate and up to date body of statute law.

        I turn to the second innovation of this Bill which concerns the intelligibility and interpretation of legislation. I refer to the proposed amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which is tucked away in Schedule 1 to this Bill. That amendment intends to insert in the Act a new section 15AA under the heading 'Regard to be had to purpose or object of Act'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed sub-section (1) provides a direction to the courts to have regard to the purpose or object of legislation in performing their vital task of statutory interpretation. Proposed sub-section (2) preserves the existing limits on the aids to construction which are available to judges. I shall return to this point later to argue that the effect of the new direction to the courts will be much weakened unless the courts are empowered to look at a wider range of materials, such as parliamentary debates, in seeking to elicit the purpose or objects of Acts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The obvious attraction of this new role of construction is that it must increase the probability that the intention of Parliament will be implemented rather than frustrated by the courts when they interpret Acts of Parliament. I want to stress that the principles of statutory interpretation have direct relevance to the impact of legislation on ordinary people. As the commissioners of the English and Scottish law commissions said in their 1969 report on the interpretation of statutes, we must aim at ensuring that any statute can be understood, as readily as its subject matter allows, by all affected by it. In pursuing this aim I recognise, of course, that to understand the complex legislation of the modern state the ordinary citizen may require expert legal or other professional advice. Indeed, problems will arise from time to time which will require reference to courts. Satisfactory rules for the interpretation of statutes can help to keep such recourse to professional advisers or to the courts within at least acceptable limits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The intelligibility of statutes from the point of view of ordinary citizens or their advisers cannot be dissociated from the rules of interpretation followed by the courts. The ability to understand a statute depends in the ultimate analysis on intelligent anticipation of the way in which it will be interpreted by the courts. In this context, the rules of statutory interpretation constitute the rules of communication between the legislators, the legislative audience and the citizens affected by it. What could appear more obvious, more self-evidently sensible to ordinary people than a direction to the courts to implement the legislative purpose? Ordinary citizens-for instance, the man on the Bondi tram-might well be amazed that any such direction should be necessary. He might assume, and with fairly good reason, that the primary task of the courts in interpreting statutes is and always has been to ascertain what Parliament intended and to reach the result which best conforms with that intention. The record of the courts in the common law world has been far from consistent, and all who followed the nullifying of clause 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the Barwick High Court, will know just how misguided that was. Judicial frustration of the legislative interest through adherence to strict canons of construction is regrettably common. It is to be hoped that this amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act will minimise such judicial behaviour in the future. Lest it be thought that the Government has shown initiative in taking this step, I stress that both the purpose test and this legislative direction to the courts to use it have been around for a very long time. As in so many areas of law reform, Australia brings up the rear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the test, or the mischief rule, as it is called, was first enunciated by the Barons of the Court of Exchequer in 1584. More recently, but still almost 100 years ago, the Canadian and New Zealand Parliaments both gave express directions to the courts of their respective countries to have regard to the object of legislation when interpreting it. That direction appeared in the Canada Revised Acts 1886 and in the New Zealand Interpretation Act 1888, and now appears as section 5 (j) of the New Zealand Acts Interpretation Act 1924. That section states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Every Act, and every provision or enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its immediate purport is to direct the doing of anything Parliament deems to be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of anything it deems contrary to the public good, and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is salutary to note that this provision has had a chequered career in influencing statutory interpretation. According to the New Zealand Law Journal of 4 June 1963, section 5 (j) frequently has been neglected or ignored by some courts while other courts have held themselves as being bound to comply with the section. We must therefore temper our enthusiasm at the proposed amendment to our Acts Interpretation Act with the realisation that it is not the magic cure-all. Finally, the English and Scottish Law Commissions recommended, in their 1969 report to which I have referred, a draft clause for inclusion in appropriate legislation. In part that clause reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        The following shall be included among the principles to be applied in the interpretation of Acts, namely-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) that a construction which would promote the general legislative purpose underlying the provision in question is to be preferred to a construction which would not;
       </para>
       <para>
        It ought to be clear to the Government that it is certainly taking no risks in this proposed new section. Indeed, by comparison with some of those to which I have referred, this is a modestly phrased direction to the courts. It is a most important step, and it is to be hoped that the intent of Parliament in enacting this provision is absolutely crystal clear to the courts. Ultimately, its effectiveness will depend on them. I have not the time nor really the inclination to discuss the various canons of interpretation which in the past have vied with and often displaced the purpose test in the judicial armoury. I refer here in particular to the infamous literal rule, classically stated by Higgins J. in the Engineers Case in 1920. I do not think anybody in this chamber would disagree with that. It has been used to such striking effect by the eminent Sir Garfield Barwick over recent years, particularly in the field of tax avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The New Zealand experience tends to suggest that the enactment of a legislative direction to have regard to purpose or object does not necessarily spell the end of these restrictive approaches to interpretation. I am, nevertheless, more optimistic about the future in the light of the judgment handed down by the High Court last week in the case of Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v. the Commissioner of Taxation. It is a welcome turnaround. I understand that argument in this case was heard over a year ago, but it is a good omen that, simultaneously with the introduction of this legislation and the anti-tax avoidance legislation, we should see a majority of four to one in the High Court having such explicit regard to the purpose of the legislation, and a taxing statute at that. No longer will we subscribe to these facades put up by tax avoidance schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before finishing I wish to raise the issue to which sub-section (2) of section 15AA is directed, that of the aids to interpretation available to the courts. It is one thing to direct the courts to have regard to the purpose or object of legislation. It is quite another to provide adequate means of ascertaining that purpose or object. Traditionally, the right of courts to consider extensive material outside the particular statute under examination has been severely limited, much more so in the English common law world than in the United States of America or in Continental countries. Most controversial of all has been the prohibition of the examination of parliamentary debates. In England, Australia and New Zealand the weight of judicial opinion is heavily against the admission of parliamentary debates for interpretation purposes. This principle was unequivocally reaffirmed in the recent House of Lords decision in Davis v. Johnson in 1978. Lord Scarman said, with the unanimous concurrence of the other law lords:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it has always been a well-established and salutary rule that Hansard can never be referred to by counsel in court and therefore can never be relied on by the Court in construing a statute or for any other purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note that in the same case Lord Denning, sitting in the Court of Appeal, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Some may say-and indeed have said-that judges should not pay any attention to what is said in Parliament. They should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. I do not accede to this view.

        . . . And it is obvious that there is nothing to prevent a judge from looking at these debates himself privately and getting some guidance from them.

        The issues for and against the admissibility of parliamentary debates were fully canvassed in the 1969 report of the English Law Commission, to which I have already made reference. I do not propose to rehearse them again, except to say that the whole question of extrinsic materials must be examined as a matter of urgency. The Interpretation of Legislation Bill 1981, currently before the British Parliament, has tackled this problem squarely, and it is time that we did the same. I note that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has foreshadowed the idea of an explanatory memorandum approved by the Parliament. This would, I hope, set out as fully as possible the purpose, object and intent of the legislation and would be specifically included in materials to which a court must have reference. It is nevertheless only one of the ways in which existing aids to construction can be expanded. Again, it is no use telling the courts to look to the purpose of the legislation unless they are given the tools with which to go beyond mere words in the legislation to ascertain the purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion I will refer to one other good omen in a most auspicious week. I read with considerable pleasure in the Australian Financial Review of 9 June that the High Court last Friday-this occurred not only in the Cooper Brookes case-rejected an application by Peter Clyne for special leave to appeal against his conviction for failing to lodge a tax return in 1977. Perhaps he ought to go back and put his act together. If this Bill and the renewed vigour of the High Court displayed in last week's judgment can combine to make legislation more effective and to ensure that social miscreants like Clyne are subject to proper regulation the autumn session of the Parliament will have partially rescued itself from disaster. We support the Bill.

         —Firstly, for the record I would like to correct the opening remarks of the previous speaker in the debate, the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). I appreciate the compliment he paid me but that is, of course, part of his somewhat quaint sense of humour. I must say that unfortunately the compliment paid is not deserved. However, before moving to the matters before us I would like to pay a compliment to the honourable member for Hawker for his role in this area. Throughout his years in the Parliament he has directed his attention in a very direct way to the issues which we are discussing today. From a reading of the speeches he has made on these matters I believe he has made a very great contribution.

        The Statute Law Revision Bill corrects drafting and printing errors and repeals Acts no longer required. This process of cleaning up legislation is a very worthwhile reform. However, the most significant aspect of the Bill is the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act. The Bill provides in Schedule I for the insertion in the Acts Interpretation Act of a new section 15AA which is preceded by a heading 'Regard to be had to purpose or object of Act'. Sub-section (1) of proposed new section 15AA states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) explained the new section in his second reading speech when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the provision to be inserted in the Acts Interpretation Act will be to confirm that in interpreting provisions regard is to be had to the object or purpose underlying the Act in question.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does the proposed new section achieve the purpose outlined by the Attorney-General? If a court took a literal interpretation of the proposed new section the provision would not achieve the stated objective. An examination of sub-section (1) of proposed new section 15AA reveals that the effect of it is that where there are two interpretations, one of which promotes the object of the Act and one of which does not promote such an object, the former is to be preferred. But the proposed new section does not state that the construction which would best promote the purpose or object underlying the Act is the construction to be preferred. As a result, unless a court regards one of the alternative interpretations as not promoting the purpose or object of the Act, the section in fact has no application.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the proposed new section as drafted purports to require an interpretation which will carry out the purpose or object of the Act as an alternative to a literal interpretation, it does not achieve this purpose if the court adopts a literal interpretation of the sub-section, coupled with a literal interpretation of the statute it is interpreting. The court is not required by sub-section (1) of proposed new section 15AA to prefer the interpretation which better promotes the object of the Act in question. To achieve the object stated by the Attorney-General the proposed new section should require the interpretation to be that which gives effect to the purpose or object underlying the Act. As it presently stands the proposed new section will not achieve this if a court decides to adopt a literal interpretation. It is similar to a dog chasing its tail: The proposed new section attempts to discourage literal interpretation but if a court adopts a literal interpretation of the sub-section it is ineffective and does not achieve the purpose stated by the Attorney-General in the second reading speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act is therefore disappointing in that it does not go far enough particularly in the interpretation of taxation law. It is difficult to understand why there was not inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act a clause requiring an interpretation which gives effect to the purpose or object of that Act. In the area of taxation it is crucial to ensure that the object of the legislation is given effect. The liberal interpretation, while essential in taxation law, should not of course apply, for example, to the Crimes Act which should be interpreted in a literal sense. For many years the High Court adopted a literal interpretation in taxation law.

         —That is correct. That interpretation emasculated the intention of the Parliament. We have subsequently seen an outrageous explosion of tax avoidance. Unfortunately, in the past the High Court has tended to follow the view expressed by Sir Owen Dixon on his being sworn in as Chief Justice in 1952 when he said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Close adherence to legal reasoning is the only way to maintain the confidence of all parties in Federal conflicts. It may be that the court is thought to be excessively legalistic. I should be sorry to think that it is anything else. There is no other safe guide to judicial decisions in great conflicts than a strict and complete legalism.
       </para>
       <para>
        This view expressed by Sir Owen Dixon has proved a disaster in the area of taxation law. Fortunately, the High Court now appears to be adopting an approach which will reverse the farcical course of ignoring the intent and object of legislation in the tax area. Of course, this change was clearly demonstrated in the decision of the High Court handed down on 5 June-it was referred to by the honourable member for Hawker-in the case of Cooper, Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v. the Commissioner of Taxation when the court moved away from the literalist interpretation. Such an interpretation had led to absurd and artificial decisions in taxation laws giving support to contrived taxation avoidance. However, today's victory in the High Court could be tomorrow's defeat. Therefore, while we support the general thrust of the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act it is a matter of regret that the legislation is still inadequate as it will depend almost entirely on the goodwill of the courts to continue their new-found desire to move away from literal interpretations in the taxation area. It is the responsibility of the Parliament to ensure that such laws passed by the Parliament are enforced and interpreted according to the object and intent of the legislation. It is our view that this amendment fails to achieve this result, particularly in the area of taxation law.

         —The purpose of the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill is to validate the compulsory acquisition in June 1978 by the Commonwealth of the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases in the Northern Territory, of 111,000 hectares and 101,000 hectares respectively. Ostensibly that was to include them in Stage II of the Kakadu National Park but in reality it was to allow the Jabiluka uranium mining project to proceed. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) pointed out in his second reading speech, these two areas are subject to a current Aboriginal land rights claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act which is now being considered by Justice Toohey. The Opposition is not opposed to the validation of the Federal resumption of the Mudginberri and Munmarlary leases to allow a successful conclusion to the land rights case and then for their inclusion in the Kakadu National Park, but it is totally opposed to the mining of uranium ore from within these leases or in any other areas. The Opposition will move a second reading amendment to that effect. The area in question includes the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases and vacant Crown land to the west of the South Alligator River, almost to the East Alligator River or the edge of Arnhem Land. It is a piece of environmentally sensitive wetlands which clearly must go into the Kakadu National Park forthwith without any recourse to uranium mining.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I have said, the pastoral leases which are the subject of this Bill are the Munmarlary lease, held by the Second Pastoral Co. and the Mudginberri lease, held by the Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd. Both companies belong to Northern Pastoral Services, which in turn is a subsidiary of the Pioneer Concrete organisation. In turn, that is owned by CSR Ltd. The Commonwealth and the companies could not agree on compensation to be paid to the companies so the properties were compulsorily acquited in June 1978. The properties were valued at $1.4m and the Commonwealth offered $3m to allow for any future profits, in spite of the fact that the leases lost money in the preceding seven years. The companies demanded $10.5m. They lodged challenges with the Northern Territory Supreme Court in November 1980 to the acquisition of the properties. These challenges may take many months or even years to be heard and will hold up the settling of Aboriginal claims to the land. The companies-that is, the former owners of these two leases-appear more interested in collecting as much money from the Commonwealth as possible than in retaining their leases. The Government is clearly worried that if these court challenges take too long, Jabiluka, the big uranium mining proposition requiring Aboriginal approval, will not proceed before it is shut out of the world uranium market.

         —It is true, as I will prove. I understand that these areas will not be included in Stage II of the Kakadu National Park until the Aboriginal land claims are settled. Then, one assumes, when the land is duly held in trust for the traditional owners by the Kakadu Land Trust, under the legislative arrangements in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, the area will be leased to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Services. We can then expect the Jabiluka area, with its 206,000 tonnes of yellowcake-it is the biggest uranium ore body in Australia-to be excluded from the park when the Governor-General proclaims Stage II. Of course the Ranger area will also be excluded, as it already has been from Stage I. No doubt the Government will make sure that, unlike Koongarra, the boundaries of the Jabiluka area set aside for uranium mining are those designated by the owners of the uranium mining lease-Pancontinental Mining Ltd. No doubt the mistakes which led to the shameful retrospective alterations to the Koongarra boundaries will not be repeated this time. The end result will be that Jabiluka will become, like Koongarra, a uranium mining enclave within the famous Kakadu National Park.
        </para>

       <para>
        Koongarra is a valley on the edge of the Arnhem Land plateau. Ranger is in the lowlands below the escarpment. Jabiluka is on the very edge of the flood plains of the Alligator Rivers region. I have been there and have observed the absolute stupidity and futility of mining in this environmentally delicate and sensitive area. All three areas are within, or on the edge of, the proposed boundaries of the Kakadu National Park. All three should be part of the park. What nation, what government except this one, would nominate a park for the World Heritage List and then proceed to allow uranium mining, the most environmentally devastating form of mining, to proceed in that park's most beautiful and sensitive areas? The demands of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Northern Territory Minister, Mr Tuxworth, may well ensure that Kakadu is rejected for the World Heritage List. Again I make it clear to the Aboriginals that, after winning this claim to the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases, under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, they will have a veto over uranium mining on any section of their land in the park excised for that purpose. Section 40 of the Act gives such a veto except over the Ranger uranium area, on eastern Groote Eylandt and on areas where petroleum leases were issued prior to the land becoming Aboriginal land. I point out that Jabiluka is not in these categories so the Aboriginals will have the right to veto, to stop, the Jabiluka project, the largest, most unacceptable and most environmentally damaging uranium mine of all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jabiluka is Australia's largest, and is believed to be the world's richest, uranium deposit. It is owned 65 per cent by Pancontinental Mining Ltd and 35 per cent by the Getty Oil Development Co. Ltd. The mine is expected to yield 206,000 tonnes of uranium yellowcake with an annual production rate expected to start at 3,000 tonnes per annum. It should increase annually to 9,000 tonnes by the fifth year. Altogether, a total of 880 permanent jobs are expected to be created. This vast uranium deposit is situated in what is currently the Mudginberri pastoral lease area and will be squarely in stage two of Kakadu National Park. Therefore, as with Koongarra, for uranium mining to proceed it will require what is fast becoming the Government's favourite form of legislation-its popular Swiss cheese method of hacking out mineral deposit sites from what should be environmentally protected areas well within the park.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major danger with Jabiluka is its situation in the most flood prone region of the proposed park. It is 200 metres from a major water system which is subject to annual flooding, that is the Magela Creek and East Alligator River systems. I went up there a couple of years ago in the dry season. As we drove along the road into Jabiluka, the manager of Pancontinental said to me: 'This road over the crossing we are going over, this low lying area next to the mining area, is 8 feet under water during the wet season'. That indicates the climate and rainfall in that area. The mining companies say that they will contain the radioactive water within a closed system. In the dry season this wetlands area is a maze of creeks and billabongs. In the wet season it becomes an area of fast flowing waterways feeding the south and east Alligator Rivers system. The threat of radioactive leakage into the park region will always be present although things have improved since the 1979 environmental impact statement was submitted proposing open cut mining. The mining companies actually proposed a 1,200 feet deep open-cut mine in this area and tried to sell that idea. Now they say that that is impractical and they will mine by underground methods. Even this Federal Government has recognised the criminal folly of an open-cut method and rejected the earlier submission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final environmental impact statement suggested using underground mining techniques. We have yet to hear the Government's ideas on it but we can rest assured that it will be accepted in principle. The problem with underground mining, whilst it is an improvement environmentally, is that it increases the health risks to workers due to their increased exposure to radiation from radon gas. In case the Minister for Administrative Services does not know, radon gas is carcinogenic. It is a product of uranium 238, thorium 230 and radium 226. These substances always end up in the tailings from uranium mining and give off radon gas for 100,000 years. The radon gas itself does not last that long but it emanates from the tailings which last for 100,000 years. At Jabiluka 50 per cent or 52 million tonnes of the tailings is proposed to be returned to the mine but the other 50 per cent will be radioactive. It is proposed that they be permanently left in the tailings disposal area and covered with a few metres of earth, in the most flood prone of those areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Jabiluka, Ranger and Koongarra projects will last 27, 15 and 12 years respectively but the potential hazards from the tailings pits will pose a threat to future life on earth for 100,000 years. There is no way, given the rainfall in this area, that these radon producing tailings will remain covered for any length of time. In one, five, 10 or 20,000 years time, what will be the geographical condition of this area? Who or what will be living there? It matters not to this Government or to Pancontinental for they and their ill-considered profits will be long forgotten. The Federal Government and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources seem incapable of understanding that the international nuclear power industry is in rapid decline. That is a reason for not going ahead with uranium mining, other than the environmental hazards. Last week the Minister for Trade and Resources issued a media release which stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the generation of electricity by nuclear power stations is seen worldwide as a necessary and irreplaceable source of energy. There are now 237 such power stations in 22 countries and a further 229 stations are under construction. The generation of electricity by nuclear power is clearly here to stay, and equally clearly, Australian uranium has a vital role to play in satisfying that demand. Around 55,000 short tons of Australian uranium, with an overall value of close to four thousand million dollars have now been firmly committed.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then went on to announce that a full feasibility study into uranium enrichment would be conducted by the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia. The problem for the Deputy Prime Minister and the uranium miners is that if Ranger--

        As I was saying, the problem for the Deputy Prime Minister and the uranium miners is that if Ranger, Jabiluka, Koongarra, Nabarlek, Yeelirrie, Beverley, Honeymoon and Ben Lomond proceed we will produce a total of approximately 435,000 tonnes of yellowcake. The Deputy Prime Minister has already said that we have a market for 55,000 tonnes. Where will we sell the other 380,000 tonnes? The Minister for Mines and Energy in the Northern Territory, Mr Tuxworth, knows that the chances of selling that amount are slim. Hence he made a statement only the other day which is in direct contradiction to the bullish predictions of the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Tuxworth said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our view is that if we haven't sold our uranium by contract by 1985, we won't be selling any more 'til the year 2000, or of that order.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our assessment is that if these two (Pancontinental and Denison), haven't sold their cake and are off and running by 1985 they aren't going to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we know why the Government wishes to push ahead with Koongarra and Jabiluka. Now we know why it wants to acquire and validate the acquisition of these two leases. Hence the Koongarra Project Area Bill last week and now this legislation this week are pushed through in the dying days of the session. The uranium industry is in decline. Australia's share of the world market may be about 8,000 tonnes by 1985-86 and, if the Government has its way, we will be producing 14,000 to 15,000 tonnes. Where will we sell the surplus? Increasingly, most nations and energy utilities are accepting that only oil is more expensive than nuclear fission to generate electricity. The construction costs for nuclear power plants have risen twice as fast as the cost of constructing coal-fired power stations of the same capacity. One must be concerned that there are problems with coal-fired electricity including air pollution and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But these problems are not as devastating as the risks from nuclear energy such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons amongst countries in highly militarised areas such as the Middle East, the inability of science to provide permanent waste disposal, the environmental dangers of mining, the increasing list and danger of nuclear accidents at the power stations and, finally, the great problems associated with the dismantling and disposal of obsolete and worn out power stations.
       </para>
       <para>
        No nuclear power station in the world has ever been successfully dismantled and disposed of. The problem is that for 100 years one cannot get near enough to them to dismantle them. This is a fact. The Minister is shaking his head. If he knows of one that has been successfully dismantled would he please stand up to tell me. I would then retract what I have said.

He gave us a very trite, small, sneaky second reading speech which did not even indicate the purpose of the Bill, which is to get on with the job of producing ore from Jabiluka while there is still some chance of grabbing a few markets from overseas. A quote from an international article, which appeared in the National Times of 7 June, illustrates what I am saying, that even major power utilities are now turning away from nuclear energy. The article states:

        Thus a vicious spiral seems under way. The utilities insist their customers will need more electricity than their customers turn out to want. The outsized projections make nuclear power appear unavoidable. But to build all those costly new plants, the companies exhaust their borrowing power and seek large rate increases. The big increases further slow the growth in the demand for electricity, so the companies once again start hacking away at their construction programs. And the first proposed plants they cut are the most troublesome and most expensive to build-the nuclear-powered ones.

If the Minister wants I will have the whole article included in Hansard. Despite all these indisputable facts, this Government is pressing ahead with uranium mining. To compound its folly it is now suggesting that its razor gang foolishness of handing over nuclear regulation to the States will actually be implemented. There is no uniform environmental legislation throughout the States to deal even with conventional resource development projects let alone uranium mining with its unique environmental problems. I did not think the Government was serious when I first saw the razor gang report that it was actually contemplating handing over uranium legislation and nuclear power legislation to the States. This will be the only nation in the world producing uranium which does not have federal control over the industry. Does the Minister realise that? This will be done in the name of the new federalism or new feudalism and in the name of smaller government. But actually, the Government is creating more government than we have ever had by duplicating federal Acts in the States.

        No doubt the legislative base lines drawn up by this Government will be the very lowest common denominator that Paul Everingham, Bjelke-Petersen and Charlie Court will accept. We are dealing with worker safety, exposure to radon gas, contamination of wetlands and water tables and long term disposal of tailings, not to mention approval for the actual go-ahead of the project. I repeat that we are now seeing the same sort of competition among the States as they attempt to attract investment in uranium mining as we have witnessed in other resource orientated projects such as coal mining, alumina refining, aluminium smelting and coal to oil feasibility studies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that we put this Government and the uranium industry on notice. Under a Labor government there will be a moratorium on the industry until its problems are solved. We will not be bound by these contracts to sell uranium, nor will we approve construction of enrichment plants or nuclear power stations. Australia is rich in resources. Our export earnings are strong and will strengthen year by year without the added income from this dirty and anti-human industry.

       <para>
        Following further consideration of the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill, which was introduced on 4 June 1981, the Government has decided that there is a need to introduce an amending clause 13, which ensures that the whole or any part of the land described in the Schedule attached to the Bill which is the subject of a claim under section 50 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 shall be deemed at all times to have been unalienated Crown land. This will enable the Aboriginal Land Commissioner to complete his consideration of the current claim over the Alligator Rivers Stage II area. I commend the Bill to the Committee.

       <para>
        The object of this Act is to ensure, as soon as it is practicable to do so, that, notwithstanding the uncertainty that has arisen in relation to the effectiveness of the acquisition of the relevant land by the Commonwealth under the Lands Acquitions Act in 1978, that land is vested in the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has a right to immediate possession of that land, for the purpose of including that land in a park or parks established or to be established pursuant to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and of using or enabling the use of part of that land for the development of uranium mining.

       <para>
        As the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) has pointed out, this legislation has been brought in at this late hour to enable uranium mining to be carried out at Jabiluka. In fact, the Jabiluka mine will be one of the biggest mines, if not the biggest mine, in the southern hemisphere. We know that this legislation is related to the second report of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which set out certain conditions under which this land acquisition should be made. One of the major recommendations of the second Fox report was that if uranium mining should proceed then it should be sequential development. We know that work at Ranger is in progress. However, the acquisition of this land will allow a second uranium mine to proceed in the Northern Territory. The Fox inquiry was greatly concerned about many of the delicate environmental considerations because we do not have enough information or detail about the environmental aspects of uranium mining in this national park. If this Government allows mining at Jabiluka to proceed before we have sufficient information and knowledge we could create great difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the honourable member for Cunningham recently visited the mining area he was shown a road which in the wet season is eight feet under water. I have been in this area during the dry season. The second Fox report contains photographs which show the seriousness of flooding that occurs in this area. These floodings have very serious consequences. The Koongarra mine, which was the subject of debate last week and which has been given the go ahead, is in the eastern Alligator Rivers catchment area. Most of the land we are discussing at the moment is in the southern Alligator Rivers catchment area. Therefore, the Kakadu National Park will contain two major catchment areas and as a result there could be serious consequences from mining. For instance, during the dry season I have seen lagoons which have been formed from flood waters. We should remember that the Aboriginals in the area, whose staple diet is fish, catch barramunda in lagoons. Of course, one of the unknown problems associated with mining is the effect that the uranium tailing dams at Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongarra will have on such areas of water. We do not know what the consequences will be or what effect this uranium mining will have on the Aboriginal life style. We in the Labor Party are very concerned about it. I said earlier that I do not think there has been sufficient debate about these matters. I have expressed my concern that they have been brought into the chamber at this late hour and we on this side of the chamber are greatly concerned. The last few words of clause 4, which relates to the objects of the Act, refer to land for development of uranium mining. I think we should keep in mind that when we are dealing with uranium mining we are dealing with the interrelationship of uranium mining with the nuclear power industry, nuclear weapons and nuclear war. I refer to the nuclear threat recently in the Middle East, when Israel bombed Iraq because of Israel's concern. We on this side of the House are deeply concerned about that act of aggression and the consequences of what could develop out of such an action.
       </para>
       <para>
        I come back to the Fox reports, the second and the first reports. We know that the third major finding in the first report said: 'The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry.' That is our great fear. That is why we have continually said that we believe mining should not proceed until all the unresolved problems have been solved, including those environmental problems in the area of Kakadu National Park-that delicate area where land is being acquired-and also in relationship to the life style of aboriginal people. This is a very delicate area. As anyone who has been there knows, it is a very beautiful area, and the more that man and mining go in there, the more they will rape the area. We have said clearly that we will repudiate any commitment entered into by a non-Labor government in regard to uranium mining. We make it clear that we do not agree with the procedure. The Opposition opposes very strongly this proposal because it does not adhere in any way to the sequential development proposals as set out in the second Fox report.

         —It is obvious that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) merely wants to frustrate this debate on the Lands Acquisitions (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill. He has not introduced one new comment in this debate. He repeated the same comments as he has probably been making for the last five years. He should merely have tabled his former statement. As I said last week, we moved a step closer to getting the Koongarra development project under way, with the Koongarra Project Area Bill. That legislation, in changing the boundaries of the project area, did two things. It gave back to the Kakadu National Park an environmentally important area; and, secondly, it isolated the effects of uranium mining from the surrounding environment. This legislation secures the Commonwealth's right to provide land for the park and outside the park. The latter will be from the Jabiluka project area.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Jabiluka mining project is probably the most important uranium venture in Australia. It is located about 20 kilometres north of the regional community centre of Jabiru in the Northern Territory uranium province. The importance of this region is self-evident, when I point out that the region contains about 79 per cent of Australia's known uranium reserves. The Jabiluka deposits, which were discovered in 1971, are almost double the amount of the Ranger, Nabarlek and Koongarra deposits combined. Jabiluka consists of over 50 per cent of the identified uranium resources in Australia, and is the largest deposit of high grade uranium in the world. Resource estimates by Pancontinental Mining Ltd indicate that it will be able to extract 207,400 tonnes of uranium oxide. Over a 27-year period, it is proposed to mine and process a total of 53.3 million tonnes of uranium bearing ore at an average grade of 0.39 per cent uranium oxide. Following a construction phase of 36 months, it is planned to commence ore production at just over 1 million tonnes per year. This will enable the extraction of 3,000 tonnes of U3O8. It is anticipated that this will increase to a level of 2.1 million tonnes a year in five years, which should produce 9,000 tonnes of U3O8.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unlike other deposits, at Jabiluka Two significant gold mineralisation has also been discovered. The most recent reserves estimate is a total of 1.1 million tonnes of ore averaging 10.7 grammes of gold to the tonne. The estimated capital investment required to reach production at Jabiluka is $800m. Obviously the work force requirements for such a project will be considerable. For the operation of the 3,000 tonnes a year ore treatment plant, in its first year of operation, 785 persons are to be employed. When the production capacity of the ore treatment plant is increased to 9,000 tonnes a year, personnel employed will increase to about 880. During the construction phase, a camp will be provided capable of housing 1,600 people. There is, however, real concern in the Northern Territory that much of this benefit will be transitory and will be considerably reduced when the project reaches its expected operating capacity of 9,000 tonnes per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        To illustrate this point, let me say that the projected benefits from payments to the Northern Territory in lieu of royalties will be $2.4m per annum. Certainly the effect of this $2.4m will be much more at the multiplier impacts throughout the whole economy. When the figure is put in the perspective of the entire development, it is not so glamorous. It compares unfavourably with the net value of the Territory asset being mined and sold, namely, an estimated $192m per annum. According to a recent study undertaken by the Department of Economics at the Queensland University, the multiplier impacts of the Jabiluka project on the Northern Territory economy during the construction phase would be 48c for each dollar spent. As the development enters normal production and construction ceases, this would drop to only 12.5c for each dollar spent. These benefits would be comparatively small because the leakages from the Northern Territory economy of most of the income generated by the project would be substantial. Profits, interest payments and money spent on equipment and other inputs would go largely interstate and overseas. Given this anomaly, it is not unreasonable to suggest that alternative means be considered to compensate for this leakage from the Northern Territory economy. Perhaps it is time to consider an adjustment in the level of royalties payable to the Northern Territory in order to see a more equitable distribution of the economic advantages of such deposits.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the second major aspect of this legislation which is related to the Alligator Rivers Stage II Aboriginal land claim. As I mentioned briefly before, this legislation sets aside any legal doubts about the 1978 acquisition of pastoral leases. The Government is keen that the Alligator Rivers Stage II land claims should not be delayed. At the same time this legislation is careful and, indeed, specific, in not interfering in any way with the rights of the former lessees of the land to continue their proceedings against the Commonwealth on the question of acquisition or their entitlement to compensation. Any opposition to this Bill would result in the land claim being brought to a sudden halt by protracted legal action which might take years to resolve. Legal action would place the land claim in abeyance and thus prevent the Aboriginal Land Commissioner from determining its status and recommending consequent action to the Government. Before opposing this Bill, the Opposition should check and find out the wishes of the Aboriginal people in the area. Relations between the Northern Land Council and Pancontinental Mining Ltd have been cordial and fruitful. Both organisations have developed a positive approach to the whole matter, and any attempt to try to portray this legislation as a sellout to a mining company at the expense of local Aborigines would be blatantly misleading.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would point out that many of the tribal elders who have provided evidence during the land claim process are of advanced years. Their expectations as to the land concerned have been raised, and any delay of some years would mean that there would be some elders who would not see the realisation of the claim that they were instrumental in helping to verify. Honourable members opposite should think again before launching blindly into their hackneyed anti-uranium speeches. By opposing this measure they will be directly opposing the expressed wishes of the Aboriginal people in this area in favour of the acquisition of this land in question. The issue involved here is whether or not one of the major Aboriginal land claims, now nearing its final stage, should be put in the 'too hard' file for almost indefinitely because of the protracted and complex legal dispute between the other parties. The Opposition should understand that in voting against this measure it will be voting quite callously to frustrate the wishes of the local Aboriginal people. Whenever members of the Australian Labor Party hear the words 'uranium mining' they automatically presume--

To suggest that uranium mining and environmental protection are irreconcilable is naive to say the least. The requirements of environmental protection legislation will be fully met by both a responsible development company and a responsible government, which this Government is.

         —The Opposition does not oppose the Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Bill. At the outset I would like to thank the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) for giving me a copy of the Bill in order that I could peruse it over the weekend. The Minister explained to me last Friday that there had been a delay and that normally he would have presented the Bill last week. The reason for the delay was the need to get concurrence with the New Zealand Government. As is explained in the Minister's second reading speech, this Bill is really only an interim measure because a completely new Christmas Island agreement is still to be negotiated with New Zealand. The Bill follows on from the statement that the Minister made on 5 March of this year. Of course, that statement itself followed on from the report of the Sweetland Commission of Inquiry into the Viability of the Christmas Island Phosphate Industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill sets out that the British Phosphate Commissioners will be replaced on the island as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission by an Australian Government owned and controlled company. So after 1 July of this year there will be a Christmas Island Phosphate Company. I note that the appointment of the chairman has been announced. The Chairman will be Mr George Warwick Smith, a former public servant who has had a long and distinguished career in the Australian Public Service. The Christmas Island Phosphate Company will actually mine the phosphate on Christmas Island. The mining will be carried out basically on a non-profit basis but the company will act in a commercial way. Therefore, we can say that the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission is no longer required to have British Phosphate Commissioners as managing agents. Eventually the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission itself will be wound up. As I said, this is still pending final agreement with New Zealand. Unlike the Government's action with the Australian Wool Testing Authority, where there seems to be a series of organisations being set up, in this instance there is evidence that the Government actually knows what it is doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second thing that the Bill does is enable the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission to transfer its stockpiles at manufacturers' plants in Australia and New Zealand to the respective governments. Finally, the Bill reflects impending changes in purchasing and distribution arrangements for phosphate by removing the requirement on the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission to dispose of Christmas Island phosphate in conjunction with phosphate supplied from other sources by the British Phosphate Commissioners. This responsibility will pass on 1 July from BPC to the Australian Phosphate Commission. So four organisations have been named. It would appear that eventually we will have a Christmas Island Phosphate Company which will mine the phosphate and also look after municipal type functions on the island, and an Australian Phosphate Commission which will assume responsibility for the purchasing and distribution of Australia's phosphate requirements. We are not quite at that step yet. The manufacturers will take over the shipping of the phosphate presently being undertaken by three ships of the Australian National Line under long term charter to the BPC. In a way I guess we can say that the Government is trying to unscramble an egg and is creating an omelet, but I think we all understand the reasons for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two questions of contention in the minds of consumers of phosphate-the farmers and graziers-which relate to the fate of the stockpiles and their cost, and the future cost of phosphate as a result of the new arrangements and other general factors. The Opposition agrees with the Government's approach to the stockpile. It is worth $79m. It amounts to 1.2 million tonnes. The proposal represents a sensible approach to securing supply for Australia. The stockpile exists. It will be monitored and measured. As it is used the manufacturers will pay into Consolidated Revenue. If the stockpiles do not drop rapidly the status quo will prevail-in other words, the stockpiles will be there-but it all depends on the rate of mining until the resource is exhausted. If I understand the position correctly, it is most likely that there would be large flow of money into Consolidated Revenue only if the Australian Phosphate Commission decided to run the stockpile of Christmas Island phosphate down once mining ceased.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prominent farmer leaders have said that the way the stockpile has been financed over the years has conflicted with the requirement that phosphate be supplied as cheaply as possible. The Minister's statement regarding the mechanism used to build up the stockpile gives backing to this view; but the question depends on the semantics of whether the stockpile, being an essential part of the supply of phosphate, was also supplied as cheaply as possible. Perhaps the Minister could comment. I am sure he is aware of some of the comments which have been made in the newspapers, particularly by Mr Michael Davidson, the then New South Wales President of the Livestock and Grain Producers Association. He is now the President of the National Farmers Federation. I think he still remains as President of the LGPA. There has been quite a substantial amount of Press comment, including one that the Government is stealing $80m worth of stockpile phosphate. I think that is stretching a rather long bow. This is a very important issue. Some commentators have said that the Australian and New Zealand governments are stealing the stockpile from the farmers. Perhaps I should read the reasons that the comment was made. The commentator was Mr Brian Hale, as reported in the Australian of 17 March 1981. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Phosphate with a current value of $80 million has been stockpiled around Australia by BPC/CIPC and it is quite clear that primary producers have paid for it, although they have not known they were doing so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Their purchases have enabled the repayment with interests, of all capital subscribed by the three national governments at the formation of BPC and have provided the funds to buy the stockpiles.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already explained my version of the reason why the Government is not stealing the stockpile. Essentially, it has built it up. It is also certain that BPC and CIPC with a staff of 2,000, have freed the manufacturers from the burden of purchasing and shipping phosphate on a world-wide basis. The package service that has prevailed in the past has given to them some compensation for any costs involved in storing stocks greater than normal commercial levels. In other words, there has been a bit of a good fairy relationship, and I think that this has been in the interests of the farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next point of contention is whether the new arrangements will, by themselves, increase the cost of phosphate to the manufacturers and thus the price of superphosphate to farmers and graziers. Mr Timbs, the Australian Commissioner on the British Phosphate Commission, said as recently as March this year that the price must rise under the new arrangements if the manufacturers take over the distribution of Christmas Island rock. The new agreements, as spelt out by the Minister, are not absolutely clear as to the extent to which manufacturers will take over the distribution, and 'distribution' seems to be the key word. If it is not beyond the present physical distribution, then there will be little scope for costs, as per the profit criteria with the manufacturing companies, to increase. Again, perhaps the Minister could respond and clarify the issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third point of contention is the absolute cost of superphosphate and fertilisers in general. Fertiliser costs the farming sector nearly $400m per annum, and amounts to more than 5 per cent of all farm expenditure. The price of superphosphate rose by 24 per cent in 1980 and has risen by up to 45 per cent since 1979. The price has risen from $14 to over $80 a tonne in the past 10 years. I think that the most recent price I saw was $85.30. At the same time, the value of the bounty has declined from 46 per cent to less than 15 per cent of the cost per tonne of superphosphate. Fertiliser usage as a whole is still below what it was for the 1970s. We do not know whether this is due to the withdrawal of the bounty for two years, whether there was over-usage, whether the farmers have used more lime, or what the reason may be. I think there needs to be some study of that. In a recent article in the quarterly review of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics Mr B. Moir went into some of those aspects. As an Industries Assistance Commission hearing is pending, I think some of these questions on the usage of superphosphate should be gone into. It is these sorts of factors that have caused the National Farmers Federation to set up a task force to investigate all possible ways of containing fertiliser costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures I have quoted clearly show that the value of fertiliser subsidies is eroding faster than the rate of inflation is increasing. The price rose from $16.49 in January 1973 to $85.30 in January 1981, an increase of $68.81. If the rate of inflation is taken into account, then the price should be about $47 and not $85. The Government is not fair dinkum on this matter of fertiliser subsidies. It has no honest commitment to the concept of subsidisation of fertiliser costs per se. It has no intellectual underpinning for the reason for its subsidies. It has only an opportunistic expedient political commitment to fertiliser subsidies. The Government has been cutting down dramatically on the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty when the price of nitrogenous fertiliser has been going through the roof. Of course, as we all know, after the razor gang report there is now no Prices Justification Tribunal to supervise fertiliser prices. The last Industries Assistance Commission report on superphosphate recommended continuation of the bounty until 30 June 1982. The Government has gone along with the recommendation to pay a bounty but it has not kept up its value. It could easily keep up the value if it wanted to, if it was fair dinkum, by paying a percentage or by indexing the bounty to take inflation into account. There is another inquiry under way, as I have said. A discussion paper is, or will be, publicly available. A hearing will be held in Sydney on 6 July, and it will be very interesting to hear the case that is put to that hearing by the various interested parties. I think the Government should state its position on the question of the subsidisation of fertilisers. It is not for this Minister to make any policy statement on the matter or to say that the Government likes subsidies only for political reasons but has no real commitment. If that is the Government's view, then it should say so.

        The Australian Labor Party has been concerned about the Christmas Island work force. The 1979-80 report on Christmas Island by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment indicates on page 23 and other pages exactly what is happening to the work force on the island. There is a lot of information for honourable members in that report, which sets out the situation very well in historical form. The Minister referred to my breadth of knowledge on the Abbott's Booby bird. Again, I am happy to see that on pages 9 and 10 the report takes into account the environment and conservation measures that are taking place on that island. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to let me incorporate in Hansard pages 9 and 10, and I seek leave to do so.

        Isolated islands have long had an attraction for natural historians because plants and animals on such islands have evolved in comparative isolation, leading to the presence of unique natural phenomena. Christmas Island is no exception. There is considerable natural and international interest in the biology of the island due to the number of endemic and endangered species present, the existence of some structurally unique vegetation communities and the dominant role played by land-crabs in the island ecosystem.

       <para>
        In 1978 the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service agreed to provide an officer to act as Government Conservator on Christmas Island and on 22 November 1979 Mr J. Hicks became the first permanent ANPWS appointment to the position. The Government Conservator advises and assists the Administrator in conservation and related matters and co-operates with the British Phosphate Commissioner's Conservation Officer, Mr D. Powell.
       </para>
       <para>
        Attention on environmental matters has focused on conservation of the Abbott's Booby (Sula abbotti). A portion of its nesting habitat coincides with phosphate fields and fears have been expressed that clearing of these areas for mining may lead to the extinction of the bird. In 1979 the British Phosphate Commissioners initiated a two year study to determine accurately the numbers of nesting pairs and their habitat preferences. The study is being carried out by Mr Powell, assisted by a biologist, Mr J. Tranter, who has been seconded to the BPC by the Administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The study should be completed by the end of 1980 and should enable the preparation of expert advice to Government on a conservation strategy for Abbott's Booby in relation to clearing plans for phosphate mining. In the interim, an existing two year moratorium on clearing mining fields 22A, 24 and 31 has been extended in time to 31 March 1981 and in extent to cover the uncleared portions of the western fields 25, 26 and 27 which also contain nesting Abbott's Booby.
       </para>
       <para>
        In June 1980, it was announced that the Government had ''agreed, in principle, that the program of reafforestation be expanded making greater use of backfilling in mining areas and that the bird populations on the island be monitored as accurately as possible so that any signs of significant decline can be determined and appropriate action taken''. This decision was in line with the recommendation of the 1980 Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the viability of the Christmas Island phosphate industry on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 21 February 1980, by proclamation in the Commonwealth Gazette, the Governor-General declared the south-western segment of Christmas Island a national park. In accordance with the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, public notice was given of the intention to declare the park in the Commonwealth Gazette of 4 October 1979 and in major newspapers circulating throughout Australia. In addition explanatory notices in Malay, Chinese and English were displayed on notice boards on Christmas Island. The notices invited representations on the Park proposal and nine submissions were received. All respondents supported the establishment of the Park and most suggested that additional areas could have been included.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Park covers 1600 hectares or about 12 per cent of the island. Features of special interest include four endemic species and six endemic subspecies of birds, an outstanding example of primary rain-forest, a spectacular population of land crabs including the robber crab (Birgus latro) the largest known land crab, five endemic reptiles and two endemic bats.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has management responsibility for the park and this is effected on the island by the Government Conservator, a service employee.

        Guided nature walks through the Park on weekends commenced soon after Park declaration and proved popular. In total twelve walks with 183 people were undertaken in the period March-June.

        B grade rock is beneficiated to a standard acceptable for manufacturing by a wash/screen process which reduces impurities. However, the volume of B grade rock processed annually is limited by the availability of fresh water on the island. Studies have concluded that the beneficiation of C grade rock by high temperature calcination is not commercially viable at this stage.
       </para>

        The remainder of A grade reserves on the Island is estimated to last about eight years at current extraction rates. Research into methods of utilising the lower grade rock is continuing.

         —The only reason I became so interested in the Abbott's Booby bird was that I was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation which visited Christmas Island. I am pleased to see in this report that the south-west of Christmas Island is now a national park of some 1,600 hectares. On that island there are four endemic species, six endemic subspecies, the largest known land crab, five endemic reptiles and two endemic bats. When we were on the island the Committee looked not only at the Abbott's Booby bird but also at a range of other fauna. We looked at the home of several rare and endangered species, and at the Christmas Island frigatebird, the Christmas Island owl, the Christmas Island imperial pigeon, the Christmas Island goshawk, the Christmas Island silvereye, the Christmas Island thrush, the Christmas Island green-winged pigeon, and the golden bosunbird. So we looked at more than just the Abbott's Booby bird. There is also the brown Booby and the red-footed Booby, the robber crabs and the green turtles. All I can say on this is that the Opposition will be keeping up its interest on the island from an environment and conservation point of view. We are pleased to see what is happening. The final thing I wish to say about the Abbot's Booby bird is that as it lays only one egg every two years I think it needs all the help it can get.

         —in reply-I will respond very quickly to some of the points that were raised by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). I appreciate the co-operation he has shown in certain circumstances that occurred in the passage of this Bill, the Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Bill. I thank him for that. I point out that although there have been increases in the price of superphosphate, generally it can be said that the price has been below world parity pricing. I think the honourable member will be aware of some of the pressures on price which have occurred in recent years, not the least of which were pressures by the Christmas Island Workers Union-about which I have no complaint-to increase wages that were paid to members of that union. That has had a fairly substantial effect on the price.

        The charter of the new company will be to mine the deposits on Christmas Island as efficiently as possible. I hope that will lead to prices that will remain in the vicinity of world parity or under world parity for the future. That cannot be guaranteed and it will depend on how everybody co-operates in the workings of the new company. Again, the Christmas Island Workers Union will play a very important part in the success or otherwise of an efficient mining operation. The Government expects to take over the stockpiles in Australia on 1 July. There have been discussions with the British Phosphate Commissioners and with the manufacturers as to the arrangements that will exist for those stockpiles. The details have yet to be settled, but the main features are expected to be that the manufacturers will pay interest only on the value of the rock they draw from the stockpiles until they replace them, and the calculation of that value will be on the phosphate content of the rock. There will be no obligation on the manufacturers to buy the rock outright, although if that is something they wish to do, they will be able to do so. This is important as to price because the use of the interest method is expected to keep down the cost of the rock. I think that all honourable members can quickly see that. To illustrate the point, that contrasts with other methods of paying for the value of the rock borrowed and then getting a refund on replacement or of buying the rock outright. As indicated in my statement on 5 March, the question of the stockpile ownership will be looked at again, no later than one year before mining on Christmas Island ceases.

         —The Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Bill and the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Bill provide for substantial payments of subsidies for the textile yarns and printed fabrics industries. Because they are so important and because so much of the revenue of this nation is appropriated in this way I believe, in spite of the late hour, I am obliged to give the matter full attention and to make a speech that would be made even if the Parliament were not in its dying hours. As we do not intend to divide the House on the Bills I hope that any honourable member who has to catch a plane will do so in the heavy knowledge that I will not be bringing down the Government on this measure. The total full year cost of the assistance will be about $73.5m. The Opposition supports these Bills because they are consistent with our approach to industry policy which recognises, in contrast we believe to the Government approach, the mutual roles of government and the private sector-the necessary partnership.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bills will result in lower prices for textile products in Australia. The level of assistance granted is very high-indeed, these bounty payments are the highest of any industry enjoying such payments-but the effective rate of assistance provided appears to represent some overall reduction from the previous levels of protection afforded by tariffs and import quotas. As such, we of the Labor Opposition see these provisions as representing an appropriate commitment to change in the textile industry and in Australia's economic structure generally at the same time as recognising the necessity for government action to avoid unnecessarily disruptive increases in import competition. But while these Bills are consistent with the Labor philosophy they frankly and ironically point to the sheer inconsistency of the Liberal-National Country Party Government's attitude to matters such as this. The present Government parties went into the election last year making various promises for increased government programs, extolling the virtues of economic policies-the ones they had been applying-and saying nothing about the irrational cutbacks, the decisions to increase taxes or the rhetoric about small government that we have heard since.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government party members approached the people in, I believe, a cowardly way because they were not, as I said, consistent. They misrepresented their own position as well as that of my party. Now we hear nothing but talk of cutbacks in the Government sector, small government and leaving it to the private sector. But here the cowardice of the election year is replaced by the different policies of the post-election year. This is not a government committed to cutting the public sector. What it really is doing is effecting a redistribution within the community. A revolution of the rich is going on around us while the Government is pleased to delay programs of assistance for disabled people, while it is happy to reduce the quality and raise the cost of health care, while it seeks to cut government commitment to welfare housing and education. It nevertheless actively pursues measures to increase assistance to business and industry. There is the inconsistency.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, Labor supports these Bills, and it supports the provision of reasonable assistance to industry. We are consistent in this attitude because we believe those other areas which I mentioned ought also to receive assistance. I repeat that we are consistent in this attitude because we believe in a co-operative approach between business and government. Just as we accept government responsibility for the welfare of Australians we accept the vital government role in industry. At the same time we are committed to planning and, where necessary, regulation in the private sector to achieve those objectives which are the basis of those plans. That is the quid pro quo. The current Government provides all of the assistance but none of the vitally needed planning or the regulation to achieve objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am reminded again of the famous phrase of the former honourable member for Fremantle who said that members among the conservative parties are very keen on socialising the losses but capitalising the gains. Of course, there are some exceptions. Parliament heard this morning from the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) about the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. That Council provides an example of what is needed. How inconsistent it is, however, that the Minister in his statement should say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Planning, co-operative effort and far-sighted policies are required from all levels of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet, at the same time, he is one who supports the nonsense of the small government rhetoric. We should not let the fact that this is the jester from among the Government Ministers disguise the inconsistency of remarks like that and the malice of the Government's neglect to welfare housing needs. So it is with this Government's approach to industry. The fact is that the Government's policies have been a complete failure. Production in manufacturing industry today is no higher than it was six years ago, in spite of such a large increase in population which should have been responsible for an enormous increase in production by now. The risk of inflation is just as great as ever and for that reason the Government's only response is to cut back as soon as there is any evidence of recovery. That is what is happening in the Australian economy right now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The confidence being instilled by expanding Government spending is being stalled in its tracks right now with high interest rates and squeezes on the monetary system. Hesitancy and recession are again evident in the manufacturing sector. The Government's approach is fundamentally wrong. Australia and Australians will not benefit from setting the public and private sectors apart. It must be recognised that each has a joint role to play, one which involves co-operation and co-ordination. Only on this basis can non-inflationary growth and an increased commitment to the underprivileged be achieved. I assert that only if the Labor Party's approach is adopted to government, to industry and to social development can Australia fully utilise its vast natural advantages.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our attitude to these Bills reflects our consistent approach. We are concerned that the 6,000 to 7,000 workers involved in these industries can maintain their jobs. We want to ensure that Australia retains employment in manufacturing because we know that at the very most the resource based development will generate directly and indirectly only about one-third of the jobs needed to employ our growing work force. At the same time this Bill is a rare one from this Government in that it results in lower prices and provides a prospect for further decreases in prices as a result of increased efficiency. It achieves this by reducing an indirect tax in the tariff previously struck for these goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government rarely looks at its own full scope and responsibility for reducing inflation. Indeed, at least one-quarter of Australia's inflation is directly attributable to the actions of the Government. Most of the rest results from a failure to pursue a responsible prices and incomes policy in the context of economic growth. Instead the Government uses a restrictive monetary policy and public sector penny pinching. The result is that there is no attitude of conciliation in our community and there is no increase in the productive capacity of our industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whenever there are signs of growth the inevitable result under this Government's conservative approach is increased inflation. It takes an international energy crisis to achieve any sign of recovery. Most sectors of the economy face continued recession. It was the textile industry's good fortune that the decisions on its future were made in the months leading up to an election. This Government committed itself to uncharacteristic measures at the time. The Bills that we are debating now are part of those measures and part of the seven-year program for the textile and clothing industries. Indeed, although these Bills do not cover footwear, problems in the footwear industry were looked at at the same time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Bill provides for the payment of bounties to the producers of lightweight woven printed fabrics used in making up garments. Existing quotas and tariffs protecting the industry will be removed from 1 January 1982, the date of commencement of the bounty period. The existing assistance arrangements provide an effective rate of protection of 150 per cent to the industry. The bounty is to be paid at a rate of 70 per cent of value added based on factory cost. This is an apparently narrower basis for bounty calculation that than used by the IAC but it is one we support. It is not known how many employees are affected by the Bill, but the total is probably less than 200 persons. The numbers employed have sharply fallen in recent years and will probably fall further as a result of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Imports currently supply about half of the market. Nine companies manufacture printed fabrics, all of whom are located in capital cities. They include the Beech, Colortex, Australian Textile Printing, Vida Turner and Frenchprint companies in Melbourne; UTA in Hobart, Actil in Adelaide and the Tennyson and Hescham companies in Sydney. The cost of the scheme is about $2.5m per annum-the provisions of the next Bill will cost much more-which is probably a greater subsidy per worker than the wages paid to those workers. As I have indicated, the Opposition supports this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bounty (Textile Yarns) Bill also implements part of the Government's seven year scheme for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, which scheme was announced last year. The Bill provides for the payment of bounties for the production of most yarns which are used in the production of fabrics. The rate of bounty payable will range from 33 per cent to 59 per cent on the basis of value added based on factory cost. Again, this is a narrower base than that used by the IAC, and hence it is difficult to assess the likely implications of these measures. The rate of assistance appears to be lower than initially suggested but higher than ultimately recommended levels. It is lower than that which applies at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bounty on cotton yarns is to be increased from the current 33 per cent to 43 per cent, following industry claims that the rate initially determined would result in disruption. It is impossible to tell whether the rate of bounty will be adequate, and we urge the Government to adopt a wait and see attitude; in other words, to monitor very closely the effect of this Bill. The Government should be willing to review rates at a later stage if they are inadequate to maintain employment at reasonable levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        The level of employment in the yarns industry is not known with precision, but is in the order of 6,000 persons. The Fibremakers and Bradmill companies are major producers. Some of their operations are in regional areas which have no alternative employment opportunities offering. At least 35 companies make yarns in Australia and not all of them are in regional areas. But, all of them give employment in particular to migrant workers and others who would not have other job opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The impact of the provisions of the Bill, since they relate to the removal of tariffs and quotas for the industry, are likely to be negative, although no estimate of the loss of employment is available. It should be noted that rapid productivity improvement is occurring in the industry and on this basis 22 per cent of the work force will be lost over the next five years. I only hope that we will shortly have a change of attitude on the part of the present conservatives who rule us and that we will have a more expansionary economic policy in the context of an incomes policy so that we do not go ricocheting back into inflation. I hope this occurs, in particular in the context of this speech so that alternative job opportunities are created at a greater rate. That is badly needed when we see that, even in industries such as the textile, clothing and footwear industries, in spite of the large amount of funds made available in legislation such as this that employment is actually dropping. The full year cost of the scheme in the second Bill to which I have referred is estimated at $71m, which implies a subsidy of over $10,000 per worker. In spite of that there will be a drop in employment in these industries. We badly need new job opportunities created in new industries and that will be done only if we have an expansionary economic policy. Once again, I state that the Opposition supports these two Bills.

        The amendments are to delete clauses 23 and 33. These two clauses were in fact related to an earlier draft of the Bill and were inadvertently included in the draft which was passed by this House and forwarded to the other place.

        —This motion gives me an opportunity to say a few words about the Notice Paper and the mismanagement of the House in recent months. Organisationally, I think the session has been the worst in recent years. In fact we would have to go back to 1971 to find a year when the mismanagement was such. The reforms of Mr Fred Daly have been dissipated. It is no wonder that there is agitation for changed working hours which is, of course, manifested in the various ballot papers doing the rounds of the Parliament at present. Some of the sins of the mismanagement relate to facilities, the hours we work, the want of a proper committee system to scrutinise legislation properly, the absurdity of so many of the Standing Orders and the fact that the Standing Orders Committee has not met in spite of all the mouthing and rhetoric that there has been about the need to improve the workings of this Parliament and to achieve more respect in the community for it than has applied in recent years.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Furthermore, there are so many cases in which the Opposition has been given inadequate notice of what is coming before this House. The last example occurred just half an hour ago when an amendment was proposed to the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill. It was not until the amendment was moved in this chamber that the Opposition heard about it. The pacing of the legislation has also been appalling. I refer to the lack of opportunity to debate some of the important issues in the nation. For instance, I place on record that neither of the two business Ministers in whose work I have a particular interest as shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce-I refer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore)-has made a ministerial statement during this session about the state of industry and business. From November to April two pieces of major legislation were debated. In May, three pieces of major legislation were debated. In the 10 days of June, by any definition, at least 10 pieces of major legislation have been debated. That means that the average has increased from one piece of major legislation every six weeks of the parliamentary session to one piece each day.
      </para>
      <para>
       On at least three occasions the Government has introduced measures late at night. I refer to a ministerial statement on interest rates made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) at 10.55 p.m. on 2 December 1980 and the Airlines Agreement Bill and related Bills introduced at 10.53 p.m. on 28 May 1981 by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). Also, the Petroleum Products Pricing Bill, bound up with the abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal, was debated in the dead of night and was given a mere 52 minutes of the program. I could say a lot more but I will not do so because I believe that I have said enough to show just how inadequate the management of this House has been.
      </para>
      <para>
       To conclude, it is worth remembering that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his 13 page election speech with its 47 pages of attachments, made scores of promises. None of those gave a hint of the sort of major legislation to be dealt with in the dying days of this session. Instead of implementing his mandate, we have government by exhaustion. The Prime Minister has put enormous effort into looking after his own friends around the place, his mates-risking internal party problems to deliver on his deals with his backers. That has been characteristic of so much of the legislation that has come before the House, such as the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill which was brought back into this chamber in the last few moments. The Government, instead of implementing its mandate, has brought in legislation to help its friends. There have been delays in the legislative program because of the dissent and turmoil within the Government. That should not have been responsible for inadequate time and inadequate scrutiny being given to these major measures. I draw to the attention of the House, as we are discharging a number of items from the Notice Paper, one that stands in the name of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). It is Notice No. 13. It has stayed on the Notice Paper since 25 November 1980. It reads:

      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       It is high time that we debated that matter in the hope of setting up such a committee so that we can improve conditions in this place and improve the scrutiny of legislation. This place might then be managed differently; there might be a reversion to the better management that applied after Mr Fred Daly brought in his reforms from 1972 to 1975.

        —I wish to make a few remarks following the remarks made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). First of all, one should point out that the amendments to the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill were circulated at 2.15 p.m. today. It is not the Government's responsibility to make sure that the shadow Minister is in the House when amendments are made available; it is his responsibility to be here when he knows that the legislation is on the Daily Program. I have some figures before me which relate to the criticisms made about the lack of work carried out by this Parliament. I will have them incorporated at the end of my speech. The figures compare the allocation of time for parliamentary debates in the Fifteenth Parliament, from 1937 to 1940, and the current Parliament, the Thirty-First Parliament. In that table three items come to notice. The amount of time allowed for debate on Bills in the Fifteenth Parliament was 66 per cent and the amount of time allowed for debate in the Thirty-First Parliament was 46 per cent. I do not think that is altogether a bad thing. Ten per cent of time was allowed for other major policy debates in the Fifteenth Parliament and 13 per cent of the time was allowed for other major policy debates in the Thirty-First Parliament.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Opposition ought to be delighted about the fact that these figures show that this Government is prepared to give the Opposition ample time to talk. The amount of time allowed for debate of other parliamentary business in the Fifteenth Parliament was 26 per cent and the amount of time allowed for the debate of other parliamentary business in the Thirty-First Parliament was 41 per cent. 'Other business' includes debates on matters of public importance, the adjournment, Grievance Day, general business and debates on parliamentary committee business and questions. So I think that the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and the Government are to be congratulated rather than criticised. They are trying to make the Parliament accessible for debate, not only on Bills, but also more particularly on some of the matters that are raised by the Opposition. About 90 per cent of matters of public importance raised in this place are formulated and initiated by the Opposition. I do not criticise that; it is proper. So the Opposition has had ample time to introduce matters of concern to it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable member for Adelaide mentioned a former honourable member, Fred Daly. I point out that at this time of the year the Labor Party, when in office, was able to get Bills through Parliament not because of the magnificent organisation of Mr Fred Daly but simply because he had absolutely no respect for Parliament. He introduced the guillotine at every opportunity. His record of guillotining Bills through this Parliament is one that I hope that this Parliament and this Government would certainly not want to emulate. We have not introduced the guillotine; we did not need to. For all the complaining by the honourable member for Adelaide, all legislation went through this House with the co-operation of the Opposition. I remember sitting here when Fred Daly was Leader of the House. We sat here very late at night. When an Opposition, whichever party it is, decides to consider a Bill clause by clause in the Committee stages the government of the day has no choice but to sit until that legislation is passed or introduce the guillotine. If Fred Daly was caught at a late hour putting a Bill through the House clause by clause we would inevitably sit late. Otherwise he would have no hesitation in ruthlessly introducing the guillotine which stifled proper debate in this Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       Over the term of this Parliament and of the previous Parliament we have introduced the opportunity for honourable members to meet in committees so that more opportunity is given to them to investigate Bills, to report to the Parliament and to debate them. I think that the honourable member for Adelaide is being just a little bit happy that the end of the session is here and he is going away throwing one over his shoulder in having a dig at the Government when, in truth, he knows that this has been a well run and well organised Parliament, as it will be in the next session. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table which shows the allocation of parliamentary time for certain debates.

       This motion gives me an opportunity to mention a number of those who have made a significant contribution to the Parliament, some of whom will not be with us when the House resumes. There are, of course, in the other place, a number of retiring senators from all parties, some of whom have been here for many years. Indeed, Senator O'Byrne, the father of the Parliament, has been here, I understand, from a time not long after the end of World War II. There is no doubt that within his memory are a great number of changes that have taken place within the Parliament and recollections of personalities that have been associated in it. On behalf of the Government parties I extend our best wishes to him and to all of those from all parties who will at the end of June be finishing their Senate term.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a number of people within this House who also will not be with us when we resume for the Budget session. In particular I mention John Fox who has been the Parliamentary Liaison Officer for the last two years. Mr Fox came to the position from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He served his term here with due attendance to his responsibilities to both sides of the House. I commend him to his new appointment back within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and wish him well in his future career. To Jeff Townsend, who is succeeding him, I extend a welcome on behalf of all honourable members and trust that his association with the Parliament will be as happy and as fruitful as the associations of his predecessors.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are many who serve us silently within the Parliament. There are many whom we recognise yet, perhaps, rarely commend for the contribution that they make. I think it is worth while specifically referring to the Hansard reporters, the attendants and the police and all of those who, in their several ways, within the Joint House Department, make the functioning of this place possible. Among those who are predominant in serving the Parliament are the Clerks, who serve us within this chamber and who provide the assistance that enables us to avoid all the human frailties that occur from loss of memory of the Standing Orders or other procedural motions which otherwise might make it more difficult for the procedures of the Parliament to be effectively processed. Finally to you, Mr Speaker-and to all honourable members-on behalf of the Government parties I wish a safe journeying wherever you might be during the recess. I hope that there is an interesting confrontation between the two sides of the House when we resume in the Budget session.

        —On behalf of the Opposition I extend my tribute to John Fox, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer. During my period as Manager of Opposition Business in this House I got to know John Fox's work well. I admired the way he carried out his duties. I also express the good wishes of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the present Manager of Opposition Business, Mr Lionel Bowen. I hope that we will see John Fox back in the Parliament from time to time. I hope he will get satisfaction from the new work to which he is turning. We extend a welcome to Jeff Townsend.

       A great number of senators are retiring. There have been other occasions when we have paid tribute to them, but honourable members on this side of the House would like to put on record our feelings of warmth towards them and express the hope that they will all have a very long and happy retirement. I also pay tribute to everyone who works in this place. I am inclined to say that if it were not for Government members this would be an enormously attractive place to which we could come from time to time. Of course, I have my tongue in my cheek. If only the Government members behaved as well in the chamber as they do outside the chamber the whole atmosphere of the place would be enhanced. Nevertheless, having said that, I wish them a happy recess. I note that many of them are travelling overseas. Of course, there will not be nearly the same number from this side of the Parliament travelling overseas. I hope that those who do will have a fruitful time. Mr Speaker, we extend to you our best wishes for the recess and our thanks for the way in which you have conducted the business of the House.

         —The enthusiastic new member for Canberra wishes to speak in this adjournment debate. It is easy to see that I have not very far to go home. In the closing minutes of this session I would like to make a few points in relation to private enterprise in Canberra. I want to take this opportunity to outline how private enterprise operates in one particular industry in Canberra-the retail industry. It is not a pretty picture. The Canberra retail industry is characterised by one dominant firm, the Lend Lease Corporation Ltd, and its associated companies. This company has a stranglehold on the small traders as it controls every major shopping centre in Canberra except the Belconnen Mall. These shopping centres include the Woden Plaza, Cooleman Court, Manuka Village, Monaro Mall, The Boulevard, as well as other offices and buildings in the Australian Capital Territory. It would also be an interesting exercise to trace the shareholdings of Lend Lease in the major retail chains that are established in Canberra.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The major problem with Lend Lease in Canberra is the severe contractual provisions it is able to force on small business people as a result of its monopoly position in the local market. Firstly, in relation to rents, because of its dominance and influence in the industry in Canberra, Lend Lease is able to set extremely high levels of rents. In addition, high turnover rates are also applied. This means that Lend Lease has the right to go through the books of each trader every month to collect its percentage of the turnover-up to 10 per cent in some cases. The effect of this is that the trader's profit margins are constantly under great pressure and, of course, this is ultimately passed on to the consumer in higher prices. A further cost inflicted on these small businesses by Lend Lease is a percentage for promotional costs and the operating costs of the shopping centre. These costs are, of course, fully incorporated into rents, not added on afterwards.
       </para>
       <para>
        At various times, traders have attempted to get Lend Lease to account for the amounts given for operating expenses and to tell them why income is not shown in relation to general recoverable expenses, but the traders have never received any satisfactory explanation. For example, in relation to the Woden Plaza, Lend Lease has refused to explain the purpose of its so-called 'sinking fund', the total monies accumulated in this fund, whether the sinking fund is used to offset repairs, the reasons for heavy repairs necessary to a new air conditioning system, and the cost of those repairs, the reason for significant amounts of painting-some of which has been done for the first time-and the heading under which these charges are included. The list goes on and on. The traders must pay whatever Lend Lease demands without any satisfactory accounting of these charges being provided. Of course, ultimately, it is the consumer again who pays for this in higher prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further objectionable provision which Lend Lease enforces is to prevent shopkeepers holding meetings. Lend Lease has written to traders in the past asserting its right to enforce this provision. I hope that no honourable member in this Parliament would wish to defend such a blatantly undemocratic arrangement whereby small business people are prevented from holding a meeting to discuss their business affairs. This year, rents and contracts are being renegotiated for a further three-year period. In most cases, this is an ideal opportunity for the management failures of the past to be reviewed and for reforms to be implemented before a further three years of misery is foisted on Canberra's retail traders. Lend Lease has been able to get away with these unsavoury practices in the past because of its dominant position in this industry in Canberra. The small trader has nowhere else to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is about time that people in this Parliament took an interest in the monopoly situation that has been established in the Australian Capital Territory. For years I have fought against this in an attempt to get a business leases review board established in Canberra. I hope that, before this Parliament again resumes for the Budget session, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) will get together with the small business people and the builders, owners and management associations to get a fairer deal for small traders in the Australian Capital Territory.

In agreeing to this arrangement, which expires at the end of the 1981 school year, the ACT Schools Authority took into account the effect on curricula and education opportunities offered to Wanniassa High students. The two non-government schools meet all costs associated with their tenancy with the exception of structural maintenance which is a normal landlord cost.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is unlikely that Trinity Christian School and Cowman College will be accommodated in Wanniassa High School in 1982 as development of that school will require additional accommodation. In the context of the Review of Government Functions, the Government has announced that it will actively promote the more economical and efficient use of government and non-government school buildings. In the light of this decision, I have asked the ACT Schools Authority to examine the question of locating Trinity Christian School, Cowman College and O'Connor Christian School in surplus accommodation in government schools that will be available in 1982 for alternative uses.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes, I am aware that some rural organisations have expressed concern about foreign ownership of rural land. The Government respects such views and through its policy on foreign investment looks very closely at proposed acquisitions of rural land by foreign interests. Before any approval is given, other than in cases where the purchasers are Australian citizens resident abroad or genuinely intending immigrants, the parties must demonstrate that Australians have been given adequate prior opportunity to purchase the land if they wished to do so and that there will be benefits through development of the property or otherwise to Australia from the investment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Foreign Investment Review Board keeps records of the proposals submitted for approval under the Government's foreign investment policy. These records do not, however, indicate whether the purchases take place. Similarly the Board's statistics do not record sales by foreign interests to Australians as these proposals do not require notification. I am forwarding to the honourable member a paper on foreign investment in rural land which outlines in some detail the Government's policy and provides detailed statistics.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Acquisitions of rural properties by foreign interests generally involve acquisitions of assets of Australian businesses and, as such, these transactions fall within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act. Proposals notified in accordance with the Act are examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board to determine whether they would lead to benefits through, for example, development, marketing and employment opportunities, and to ensure that Australians have been given an opportunity to purchase the land.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government considers each proposal carefully on the advice of the Board and grants approval only where it is satisfied that the acquisition of land by the foreign person would not be contrary to the national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am informed that the approaches adopted by the other countries mentioned by the honourable member are:
      </para>
      <para>
       New Zealand
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Land Settlement Promotion and Land Acquisition Act 1952, as amended, foreign interests are restricted from acquiring rural land, offshore islands and any land required for public use. The legislation aims to restrict absentee foreign ownership of certain types of land in New Zealand.
      </para>
      <para>
       Restriction of foreign ownership applies to any land of two hectares (five acres) or over in area which is zoned for rural purposes, or is so zoned that farming of any kind is a predominant or conditional use in that zone.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, acquisition of land by a foreign interest may be permitted if:
      </para>
      <para>
       the acquisition is for experimental and research purposes which would benefit New Zealand; or
      </para>
      <para>
       intended uses of the land, other than for agriculture, clearly show significant benefits to New Zealand and thus are in the national interest; or
      </para>
      <para>
       an individual alien permanently resident in New Zealand farms the land exclusively for his own use and benefit and has the ability and means to achieve these purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       If land is part of the assets of a business, and where the consideration involved exceeds $NZ100,000, a non-resident has to notify full details to the Overseas Investment Commission of any proposal that would lead to the non-resident interests controlling 25 per cent or more of the voting rights of the business. Each proposal is considered by the Commission on its merits.
      </para>
      <para>
       Canada
      </para>
      <para>
       The Provinces have primary jurisdiction with respect to real estate and regulations vary according to the host Province. Some of them have fairly restrictive statutes. The regulation of foreign ownership of real estate may also fall within Federal Government responsibilities which are administered by the Foreign Investment Review Agency. Foreign acquisitions of real estate are subject to review to the extent that they represent the acquisition or control of a Canadian business.
      </para>
      <para>
       The United States
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act 1978, all foreign interests who own or acquire United States agricultural land are required to report their holdings with the United States Department of Agriculture. This legislation is not intended to restrict or regulate land purchases or sales by foreign interests. It is aimed primarily at strengthening the efforts to monitor foreign investment in United States agricultural land.
      </para>
      <para>
       The American States generally have no restrictions on ownership of land by resident aliens. However, nine States have laws that generally prohibit or restrict in a major way, non-resident aliens from owning real estate. Some of these States also have restrictions on ownership of land by resident aliens. An additional four States have laws that limit the total acreage that aliens can acquire or hold and the limits range from 5 acres to 500,000 acres. Six States, five of which are included in the nine States mentioned above, have laws that permit aliens to hold land for a limited duration or require aliens to dispose of all or part of their holdings within specified time periods if they do not become United States citizens or residents of the State.
      </para>
      <para>
       The policies of these countries are related to their particular circumstances just as the Australian policy is aimed at meeting Australia's needs. This Government's policy and the way in which it is administered provide a reasonable basis for exercising supervision and, where necessary, restraint of excessive foreign investment in Australian land.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. These deaf children form part of a group of handicapped children in the Australian Capital Territory who on an individual needs basis require school transport but who are not eligible for bus transport provided by the Capital Territory Health Commission. Because of difficulties associated with the then existing transport service which was provided by a local taxi co-operative, the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority invited public tenders for the provision of school transport for this group of handicapped children. A mini bus service was introduced at the beginning of the 1981 school year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Extended discussion and consultations took place prior to the decision to invite public tenders, between officers of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority, and parents and teachers on questions of reliability, punctuality and safety. Various alternative modes of transport were examined. A questionnaire was sent to parents during the latter part of 1980 asking if they would be interested in transporting, with payment from the Authority, their own child and possibly other children. The responses clearly showed that generally parents were not in a position to transport their children on a regular basis, preferring the Authority to provide transport.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Officers of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority have recently completed a survey of the bus service and have reported to me that although the buses being used are not fitted with seat belts, their investigations revealed that satisfactory safety standards were being maintained. It was found that the behaviour of the children was generally good and that they were well controlled by the drivers, who despite some initial problems of communication, were able to exercise reasonable care and supervision.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. Additional vehicles have been provided to overcome the excessive length of time spent in travel and to eliminate the need to change buses. With the exception of students travelling from Tuggeranong Valley to Lyneham, no student should now spend more than 30 minutes on a journey to or from school.

       (3) It is impracticable to ensure that Australian pensions, when affected by United Kingdom pensions, are assessed on exchange rates applied by banks in day-to-day operations. For the purpose of calculating Australian pensions a notional exchange rate is set, based on the Commonwealth Trading Bank on-demand air mail buying rate, and monitored daily. The notional exchange rate is altered when the exchange rate between the Australian and United Kingdom currencies varies by 5 cents or more Australian per one pound sterling, and appears to be relatively stable. This method of assessment is currently being reviewed.

       (4) For people in Australia, United Kingdom pensions are not adjusted, but paid at the rates in force when the recipient left the United Kingdom or at the time of grant, if later.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Commonwealth Government has no legislation governing conditions in sheltered workshops. I am, however, aware that some States have legislation which could be used to license, and thereby regulate, sheltered workshops. To the best of my knowledge the situation varies among other English-speaking countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, the legislation under which the Government subsidies sheltered employment services, does not prescribe working conditions for these facilities. Some control is exercised through requirements that sheltered workshops sign a written agreement when they are approved under the Act. The agreement specifies that approval is conditional upon, inter alia, payment of disabled workers according to the work they perform, and organisations' compliance with relevant State and Local Government requirements on building standards, health and sanitation, safety measures and conditions of employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to a wage, the majority of disabled people in sheltered workshops receive Sheltered Employment Allowance. This allowance is paid at similar rates to the invalid pension and includes an income test free Incentive Allowance of $5 per week. Sheltered Employment Allowance is subject to the same terms and conditions as the Invalid Pension and undergoes regular adjustment in accordance with CPI movements. This is provided for by section 28A of the Social Services Act, the legislation under which pensions are paid. It is noteworthy that Australia's provisions in relation to Sheltered Employment Allowance were commented upon favourably at last year's World Rehabilitation Congress in Winnipeg, as a possible model for other countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sheltered workshops also employ a number of able bodied people. The Government, under the provisions of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, subsidises the salary of any person employed in a workshop who is directly concerned with supervising or training handicapped people.

      <para>
       (1) Does he recall my representations to him concerning Seven Tel attachments for television sets which enable the profoundly deaf to call up printed information such as news, weather, cyclone warnings, police messages and other public information bulletins.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Can he say whether profoundly deaf people can get little or no benefit from public information screenings when they can see the image but hear no sound and whether the benefits of television can be considerably increased for these persons where printouts are available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Is it a fact that these attachments are expensive and attract a sales tax component.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) If so, will he consider the exemption of these attachments or television sets from sales tax where the purchaser produces a medical certification of profound deafness.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Would this be an important and humane action in 1981, the International Year of Disabled Persons.

       (1) Yes.

      <para>
       (2) I would imagine that deaf persons would obtain greater benefit from television where printouts are available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The recommended retail price of $475 for an attachment includes a sales tax component of 27 1/2 per cent of the wholesale price of the attachment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) and (5) In 1979 the Government widened the then existing sales tax exemption item 123 covering certain goods for use by blind persons so as to make exempt from tax goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by handicapped persons generally, unless those goods are of a kind ordinarily used by persons who are not handicapped. More recently, in the 1980-81 Budget, the Government announced its intention to support financially the observance of the International Year of Disabled Persons and its decision to implement a number of initiatives to assist disabled persons. Further initiatives in relation to the disabled will be considered during the preparation of the 1981-82 Budget. The matter of exempting these television attachments when for use by deaf persons will be considered in that context.

      <para>
       This matter was thoroughly examined in the Report of the Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (the Galbally Report) dated May 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Review group, while recognising that many migrants feel a strong obligation to give financial help to family members in their home country, noted that provisions enabling migrants to send money out of Australia were generally adequate to meet any family obligations a migrant in Australia may feel. In recording its belief that it was an unreasonable burden on the Australian taxpayer to allow tax rebates for some of these overseas payments, the Review group noted that it was extremely difficult to check claims as to the existence of the people abroad in respect of whom rebates were claimed, and, more importantly, to take into account their income for the purpose of calculating the rebate.
      </para>
      <para>
       After careful consideration of the Report and of all other relevant issues, including especially the substantial cost to revenue caused by the mounting abuse of the rebate attributable mainly to the difficulty in checking claims noted by the Review group, the Government decided to withdraw the rebate in respect of dependants resident overseas from 1 November 1978. This did not affect rebates for dependants temporarily overseas who continue to be residents of Australia for taxation purposes, or for wives and children awaiting migration to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       No new aspects have been raised which would warrant reconsideration of the matter by the Government and the Australian Taxation Office must, of course, apply the law as it is enacted.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The 5th Annual Report of the Commissioner for Community Relations acknowledges that Aboriginals are eligible for housing assistance under general welfare housing programs. In this respect, general eligibility criteria apply to Aboriginal people along with any other groups of persons.
      </para>
      <para>
       Aboriginals also receive special assistance by way of earmarked grants under Part III of the Housing Assistance Act 1978, and the Commonwealth-Northern Territory Housing Agreement in recognition of their special needs. Amounts of $21.06m and $22.10m were allocated among the States and the Northern Territory for this purpose in 1979-80 and 1980-81 respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       Administration of all welfare housing programs funded through the Department of Housing and Construction is the responsibility of the State Governments. The earmarked funds mentioned above are directed to special programs administered by State authorities in liaison with authorities having special interests in Aboriginal housing including the regional offices of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The need to earmark funds to meet the special housing needs of Aboriginals will continue to be recognised in the proposed 1981 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs has for many years funded a special program of grants to State Housing Authorities for housing for Aboriginals. In recent years this program has been controlled by the 1978 Aboriginal Housing Agreement. Participation of Aboriginals in policy formulation and management matters is encouraged under this Agreement. Under this program grants totalling $12.9m and $10.7m have been allocated for 1979-80 and 1980-81 respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, the Aboriginal Housing Association program funded by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs allows Aboriginal communities to establish, plan and administer housing schemes. Funding totalled $20.5m in 1979-80 and is estimated to be $22.1m in 1980-81.
      </para>
      <para>
       Aboriginal Hostels Limited, a company wholly owned by the Commonwealth Government, provides a home environment enabling Aboriginals to avail themselves of education, training and employment opportunities.

       The Aboriginal Development Commission makes available concessional home purchase loans to eligible Aboriginals who cannot obtain home finance on the open market.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Commonwealth grants for Aboriginal housing are directed to special programs for Aboriginals which are either administered by or in liaison with the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs and with State Government authorities having well defined responsibilities. These practices are considered to be in accordance with the recommendation of the Commissioner for Community Relations.

       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. It does show that regulation of the accessibility of alcohol is not a major determinant of alcohol consumption. Evidence is produced suggesting that alcohol consumption and the relative price of alcohol (the price of 10 litres of absolute alcohol divided by personal disposable income) vary inversely but this does not prove that price is a major determinant of consumption. The degree of affluence, as reflected in the disposable income, is probably more important.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. The article contains statistical evidence linking variations in the level of average consumption with variations in the level of occurrence of some chronic alcohol-related problems. These are only associations the meaning of which is uncertain, and no evidence is produced about the associations of variations in the level of average consumption and other alcohol-related problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No. The Government's policy on alcohol-related health problems was detailed in the response to the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare: 'Drug Problems in Australia: an Intoxicated Society?', tabled in the Senate on 19 March 1980 which stated that the Government favoured an overall reduction in alcohol consumption and that the Government would take health considerations into account in a budgetary context when setting tax rates on alcohol.

      <para>
       (1) The Income Tax Assessment Act requires a taxpayer to include in assessable income the gross income derived from all sources in or out of Australia. Because amounts paid by way of compensation to victims of pneumoconiosis are of an income nature they form part of a recipient taxpayer's assessable income. No details are available of the estimated amount of tax involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides for the exemption from income tax of specified classes of income. The section does not operate to exempt from tax amounts paid by way of compensation to victims of pneumoconiosis. The Commissioner of Taxation has, however, advised that in some cases in Western Australia the view was in the past mistakenly taken that these amounts did not constitute assessable income.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Decisions of the courts have confirmed that compensation payments of the type referred to are assessable income. It would be necessary to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide that the amounts be exempt from income tax.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) to (5) I understand that a paper by Professor Nevile entitled 'Inflation and the Incentive to Invest' refers to the impact that an increase in the nominal interest rate might have on business investment. I also understand, however, that the main point of the paper is to demonstrate the adverse impact that a rise in inflation has on investment, both through its effect on interest rates and through corporate profitability.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is worth noting that simple regression results, such as those cited by Professor Nevile, do not in fact 'show' anything. They can at best provide only a broad guide to underlying economic relationships and cannot capture all the influences bearing on (in this case) private investment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It may also be worth noting that if there is one thing that is abundantly clear about the Australian economy today it is that Australia is not suffering from any shortage of new investment at this time. On the contrary, business investment is likely to grow by around 20 per cent in real terms in 1980-81 and recent expectations data from the ABS point to further very strong growth in 1981-82.

In this Report doubts were raised on the continuation of certain engineering schools including those at Deakin University and Bendigo College of Advanced Education.

Against the background that gifts to assist the financing of international sporting or athletic events have never been allowed, the Government decided that gifts to the Foundation should not be tax deductible. I do note, however, that the Commonwealth is making a substantial contribution towards the Games in a number of ways, including a grant of $10m towards the cost of capital facilities; up to $11.5m to enable the ABC to act as host broadcaster; $2m in administrative and other support; and the issue of commemorative coinage, which is expected to yield the Foundation up to $1.5m.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. In formally opening the 1st International Conference on Technology for Development I referred to my announcement that CSIRO would set up a research group to design very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI). Staff are now being recruited. I reiterate my view that this initiative will provide a major impetus to microelectronic technology in Australia. It will develop an indigenous design capability in Australia, and raise awareness of the enormous potential of custom chips in the late 1980s.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No, it is not a fact. The CSIRO Executive has allocated $500,000 from the Organisation's 1980-81 Appropriation. The project will be financed at the level of $500,000 per annum for the next two years in the first instance. The amount envisaged is $1.5m in toto over 3 financial years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The comparison drawn between the expenditure of Great Britain, France, Italy and West Germany, and Australia is not valid. The European expenditure supports experimental and theoretical work concerning all aspects of the production of microelectronic circuits, including manufacture at the pilot plant scale. The CSIRO initiative will focus exclusively on the problems of chip design. CSIRO believes that an effort on this scale will be fruitful. In this matter they are not alone.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. I do not accept, however, the conclusions reached in this article. It is based on assumptions specific to the American situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The facts as stated in 2, 3 and 4 above vindicate my confidence in the project. It is of considerable importance. CITA has identified microelectronics as a key area of modern manufacturing technology. The CSIRO initiative will give Australian industry access to an important sector of microelectronic technology.

      <para>
       The telegram service offers a personalised message passing service and the fixed component of the telegram charge varies according to the sender's choice of method to be used in passing the message.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the practice in cases where the sender simply addresses a telegram to a residential or business address and pays the full charge rate for Telecom to deliver the message by the fastest means available. Quite often this is by telephone or telex. In these cases, the fee charged is not, therefore, for the physical delivery of the telegram but for transmission of the message by the fastest means possible. Should the addressee require a copy of the message which has been telephoned, it can be provided at no additional charge.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where messenger service would provide the fastest means of delivery or if Telecom judges the messenger delivery would be more appropriate, say for telegrams concerning death, illness, or the like, then this means of delivery is used.
      </para>
      <para>
       The sender, at the time of lodging a telegram, has the option of specifying messenger delivery by including the paid service indicator 'Messenger' before the address, and in such cases physical delivery of the message will be undertaken. However, in these circumstances it may not be practicable to pass the message to the addressee as quickly as when alternative methods such as telephone and telex are used.

       (2) I understand that in making his criticism, Mr Macdonald was referring to the proposed takeover in 1979 of the Herald and Weekly Times Limited Group by the News Limited Group.

      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The present section 50 of the Trade Practices Act is the result of a considered decision taken by the Government when it implemented a substantial revision of the Trade Practices Act 1977. The Government has not since then changed its policy in relation to section 50. The Government is, of course, continuing to monitor all provisions of the Trade Practices Act;

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. However I understand Depo-Provera is used by Family Planning Associations, health authorities and private doctors in individual cases where a specific need exists for which no other contraceptive method is considered suitable.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Those organisations which have approached my Department on the use of Depo-Provera as a contraceptive have been advised that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) has considered progressively available information on Depo-Provera for contraceptive use on a number of occasions. The Committee is of the opinion that the use of the drug as a contraceptive must be regarded as investigational since there are unresolved questions related to its safety. This statement appears in the product information distributed by the company for this drug.
      </para>
      <para>
       These organisations have also been advised that the ADEC supports the concept of properly controlled clinical trials provided they are designed to help resolve some of the questions raised and provided adequate measures are incorporated in the trial protocol satisfactorily to protect the participants. To date no applications have been made to my Department in this regard.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) The Government is not in a position where it can take steps to ensure that due precautions are not relaxed in the situation where a drug is already available and relatively safe and effective for other accepted indications. It is a recognised fact that a doctor may occasionally decide that special circumstances warrant the use of a drug for conditions other than those for which it has been approved. In such circumstances the responsibility for adequately informing the patient or the guardian and for any adverse consequences of the therapy must rest with the practitioner concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Alternative forms of contraception are readily available and the product information relating to these is adequate to enable the medical practitioner to explain the position to his patient. It is a matter for the practitioner to determine what he considers to be the most appropriate method of contraception to suit the particular circumstances of his patients.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. However, it is for the reasons suggested by the honourable member that my Department has encouraged organisations to design properly controlled trials using Depo-Provera as a contraceptive.

The animals were examined by a United States Government veterinarian with regard to their general health status and tuberculosis. The chimpanzees were accompanied to and from the Perth Airport by a veterinary officer.

      <para>
       (1) to (3) and (7) Courses in languages other than English are offered at primary and secondary levels in Government, Catholic and independent schools, by part-time and full-time ethnic schools, and by tertiary institutions including the TAFE sector, In addition, some courses are offered by professional associations and by organisations in the private sector. Neither total numbers of students and teachers nor the number of schools and institutions offering courses are known. My Department is at present collating information currently available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) It is generally the case that secondary school teachers of languages other than English have tertiary qualifications and some professional training in language teaching techniques. This, however, is less likely to be so in primary schools, where classes may be taught by teachers who speak a language other than English but without specialist qualifications. Some programs involve participation of members of ethnic communities. In a few cases teachers and/or other assistance are being provided by foreign governments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The provision of teaching materials for languages other than English is the responsibility of the authority concerned. However the Schools Commission through its Multicultural Education Program has provided funds for the development and production of language teaching materials. Languages for which materials are currently being produced include Italian, Greek and Dutch. Curriculum and material projects have been undertaken by schools and in some States by community groups. The Curriculum Development Centre has also supported the development of materials for community language teaching, and is involved in the Schools Commission Greek and Italian Curriculum Projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Since 1978 the Government in accordance with recommendation 45 of the Galbally review has made additional funds available to the States for multicultural education including the teaching of community languages. The total allocation of $5m has been disbursed over a period of three years by the Schools Commission on the advice of State co-ordinating committees. In 1979 the total allocation for that year of $0.5m was directed to supporting the teaching of community languages. In 1980 and 1981 $1.5m and $3m respectively were made available for the further development of community languages for other aspects of multicultural education. General purpose recurrent grants from Commonwealth to State or non-Government schools can be used for foreign language teaching at the discretion of the authorities concerned.

       (8) and (9) Courses provided by the education authorities are in general held during school hours as part of the normal school curriculum. Ethnic school classes are mostly conducted outside normal school hours, although some are 'inserted' into normal school programs. At the present time it is estimated that there are between 1,200 and 1,300 ethnic schools in Australia. This figure does not include an estimated 600 'insertion' classes involving about 6,000 children.

       The Government supports the teaching of languages in ethnic schools, and is providing $30 per capita grants to part-time non-profit-making ethnic schools with an open admissions policy. A survey is to be conducted to determine appropriate support for ethnic schools after an initial two-year funding period.

      <para>
       (2) Documents prepared for use in the High Court of Australia are, as a general rule, required to be on A4 size paper. However, I am advised that it is the practice in appeals to the High Court from the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to allow the reproduction of the Court of Appeal appeal book if special representations are made by the parties on the grounds of cost. In other cases parties have photo-reduced the Court of Appeal appeal book, but I am advised that photo-reduction is unsatisfactory in most cases and that the High Court does not encourage it.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. The cost would vary according to the size of the appeal book.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The size of documents used in proceedings in the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of New South Wales is a matter of pactice and procedure within the responsibilities of those Courts. I am advised that there have been discussions between the two Courts on this matter, but that the problems have not yet been resolved. I hope that it will be possible for these problems to be overcome by agreement between the Courts so that the costs of litigation can be kept as low as possible.

       (1) Some 2000 teachers are employed in the Adult Migrant Education Program throughout Australia. The bulk of these are employed on an hourly paid basis. The position regarding permanent teachers varies according to the appropriate mix of full-time and part-time staff needed to facilitate a positive and substantial benefit to stablility, quality and effectiveness of program services. Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania have no permanent teachers employed in the program. New South Wales has some 123 permanent teacher positions, Queensland 6, South Australia 9 and the Northern Territory 6. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia employ some full-time temporary teachers and in New South Wales a number of hourly paid staff work on a full-time basis.

       (7) and (8) A detailed syllabus has been developed for the on-arrival program and supplied to teachers working in that program. This work has been well received in Australia and commended by international experts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Pilot materials based on that syllabus have been prepared including slides, cassettes, charts and language skill practice materials, with a view to national production of the materials. The idea has met with limited success and some further development is necessary before national production is possible. The development of further national course material for student and teacher use is at present under consideration.

      <para>
       A course syllabus and accompanying materials have been prepared for use in the courses-in-industry program.

       The trialling of the ASLPR (a uniquely Australian language proficiency rating scale) has been concluded and techniques have been developed for establishing proficiency levels according to the scale (through the observace of actual language behaviour within given situations and settings). The ASLPR is being increasingly used at all levels of the program. It assists classroom teachers to determine the capabilities-and therefore the course requirements for individual students-as well as providing an instrument for broader needs assessment and course planning and development at the State and national levels.

Under Galbally Recommendation 7, funds have been provided for in-service training and teacher development, especially for the On-arrival program. Two national in-service conferences have been held for Officers-in-Charge and Teachers-in-Charge with funds provided under this Recommendation. Funding has also been provided for local in-service arrangements, initially as a follow up to those conferences, and subsequently to assist the continuing development of teacher skills in planning and conducting courses, developing materials and evaluating outcomes.

       The two arrangements referred to are the Technical Co-operation Program, which is administered in Australia by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and the Basic Standardisation Agreement, which is administered by the Army. Neither contains a definition of chemical and biological defence. The terms are interpreted by the participating countries in accordance with common usage. The definition of chemical and biological defence which is applicable to Australia's involvement in both arrangements is that stated in the Australian Joint Services Staff Manual Glossary: 'The methods, plans, procedures and training required to establish defence measures against the effects of attack by chemical and biological agents.'

      <para>
       The question of providing Repatriation and Defence Service Homes benefits to members of the United Nations Peacekeeping, Monitoring and Observing Forces and to members of similar forces has been considered on many occasions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although it was recognised that they would be placed in a position where injury or death could occur in the course of their duties, they were not required to engage enemy forces in military operations and were not considered to be on 'special duty' in a 'special area' as defined in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consideration of this matter involves more than service in Palestine. It would also have to include the extension of benefits to all serving Defence members and others involved in peacekeeping forces e.g. those in Cyprus.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, members of peacekeeping, monitoring and observing Forces are eligible to claim compensation under the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act 1930-1970 which has since been replaced by the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971.

      <para>
       (1) Where an appeal is lodged against a decision made by an officer in a Social Security branch office or by a State Director, and that appeal has not previously been considered by a Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the appeal is referred to the Tribunal for registration and is then handled in accordance with the normal procedures governing social security appeals. These procedures require, among other things, that the decision appealed against be reconsidered by the Department of Social Security and then, if the appeal is not to be conceded at this stage, dealt with by the Tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where an appeal has previously been considered by a Tribunal which has recommended dismissal of the appeal, since 9 September 1980 the unsuccessful appellant may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The State Director of Social Security in the case of representations made to him from a Federal Member of Parliament, and the Director-General of the Department in the case of representations to the Minister for Social Security, could still review the decision appealed against where, for example, additional evidence was supplied, notwithstanding this further right of appeal. The Federal Member is, of course, advised of the outcome of the appeal. Representations from Federal Members not involving an appeal are dealt with in accordance with usual departmental procedures.

       (2) Statistics on the average time taken to process these appeals are not collected separately from statistics for all finalised appeals dealt with by the Social Security Appeals Tribunals.

      <para>
       (3) Statistics on the average time taken in 1980 to process appeals made to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals are not available by pension, benefit or allowance. The average processing time shown in the table below is for finalised appeals dealt with by the Social Security Appeals Tribunals by State and Territory. The average processing time measures the number of working days between the date of registration of the appeal by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the date of the Tribunal's recommendation. Where the Tribunal recommends dismissal of the appeal, the date of the recommendation is the same as the date of finalisation. However, where the Tribunal recommended the appeal be upheld, processing time does not include the period between the date the Tribunal made a recommendation and the date the Department finalised the appeal, for which statistics are not available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No. A Social Security Appeals Tribunal has a doctor as one of its members only when dealing with medical appeals under the Social Services Act 1947. There is no requirement to have a doctor when a Tribunal is dealing with a non-medical appeal.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) A medical practitioner was appointed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals in Queensland on 27 May 1981 and I expect to make additional appointments soon. A major obstacle in the making of such appointments prior to this was the reluctance of suitable doctors to accept appointment at the then prevailing rates of remuneration. However, after I raised this matter with the Minister for Administrative Services, a new determination was made by the Remuneration Tribunal on 4 May 1981 increasing the sitting fees payable to all members of the Social Security Appeals Tribunals.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The delay in appointing doctors to the Queensland Social Security Appeals Tribunals has unfortunately meant that some medical appeals have not been handled as expeditiously as might otherwise have been the case, but it is not possible to say how many appeals have been so affected. It is important to note however that the right of appeal operates in addition to, rather than in substitution for, the review process which previously operated, and that delays in the appointment of doctors to the Tribunals have in no way delayed this process, which involves the Department of Health and, as appropriate, external medical specialists.

       The Government announced on 20 August 1980 that an additional $1m will be provided under the Schools Commission's Special Education Program for extra Staff resources to assist the integration of a further 300 handicapped children into regular schools, to operate from 1981. In addition, priority will be given to funding projects that will result in the movement of as many children as possible from special to regular schools. Government and non-government school systems, and schools, will be eligible to apply for grants for projects. The funds may also be used to:

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The original 1980-81 Appropriations made for my Department for Division 286-Administrative and Division 288-Commonwealth Employment Service were those presented to the Parliament in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1980-81. The Government considered my Department's estimates in the light of its policies in respect of particular areas of expenditure and of general financial and economic objectives.
      </para>
      <para>
       The general principles applied to the preparation of estimates by my Department are set out in the Directions issued by the Secretary of the Department of Finance under the Authority of the Audit Act 1901. These Directions are long standing and have been endorsed by successive Governments. The relevant general principles are set out in Finance Direction 6.3 and provide in essence that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Estimates shall represent a realistic assessment of the sums expected to be spent and shall be based on current or known costs. Items of a recurring nature may be estimated on the basis of experience.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Estimates shall not include amounts in respect of proposals which are so far from firm that it is not possible to form any real estimate of what payment, if any, will be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Department of Finance Information Paper, 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations Made By Acts Nos. 141 and 142-Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1980-81', sets out amounts by which my Department estimated, at the time of preparation of the Appropriation Bills (Nos. 3 and 4) 1980-81, expenditure under the Appropriation Items concerned would at 30 June fall short of the Appropriation originally made. What actual underspending will occur in respect of those or other Items cannot be stated with certainty at this stage. The estimated savings would reflect for the most part the following circumstances:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Current expectation that events would not occur by 30 June 1981, in cases where financial provision had been made in the Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1980-81 in the then expectation that they would occur by that date.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Compliance with Government policy that, as far as practicable, savings be offered as offsets to additional funds sought in the Appropriation Bills (Nos. 3 and 4), 1980-81; and
      </para>
      <para>

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) and (2) Although I am unaware of the basis of Dr Tonge's estimate, the Australian Health Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in 1977-78 revealed that 19 per cent of children under 5 years, 27 per cent of persons between the ages of 5 and 14 years and 32 per cent of persons aged 15 to 24 had a chronic condition (ie. any permanent disability; any illness, injury or impairment which a respondent claims to have had for more than six months; illnesses under control e.g. diabetes, epilepsy).
      </para>
      <para>
       Because a dissection of the above data by single year ages is not available, the percentage relating to such persons under the age of 18 years cannot be accurately determined.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ABS plans to repeat the Australian Health Survey in 1983. No later figures for comparative purposes will be available until the survey is completed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The definition of a chronic condition used in the Health Survey covers a wide range of illnesses and disabilities of varying levels of severity. I presume many of the children of school age who are included could be attending normal schools. The relevance of the Survey to the Government's supplementary program to assist, the integration of handicapped children into normal schools cannot be readily assessed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Government's commitment in respect of the integration of handicapped children into regular schools is to provide $1m (subject to normal allowance for price rises) in 1981 for:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) projects that will result in the movement of as many children as possible from special to regular schools;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) support to enable isolated handicapped children to attend neighbourhood regular schools;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) projects designed to test new ways of fully or partially assisting handicapped children already integrated into regular schools;
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) facilitating the enrolment of handicapped children who are beginning their formal schooling into regular primary schools.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of these purposes it is intended that priority should be given to the first one, which is concerned with the movement of children from special to regular schools.
      </para>
      <para>
       Applications from systems and their schools and from non-systemic schools are appraised by panels in the States and the Northern Territory representative of Education Departments, Catholic Education Commissions, Associations of Independent Schools and the Schools Commission. The recommendations of appraisal panels are submitted for my approval. Grants are offered and payments are made to systems and individual schools for approved projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) For 1982 the Government has maintained expenditure, in real terms, on the integration of handicapped children into regular schools. This expenditure will be more closely related to the special education programs for government and non-government schools by being incorporated as an element of these programs in 1982.

       No action has been taken by the Department of the Capital Territory to recycle paper.

This initiative has been supported by the National Capital Development Commission through the I.D.C. on Waste Disposal.

      <para>
       It is estimated that in Canberra the company is collecting a total of 10,000 tonnes of recyclable paper and cardboard annually, of which 1,200 tonnes is generated from Government buildings and about 1,000 tonnes from the recycling centres.

      <para>
       (1) (a) to (e) The assistance package for domestic passenger motor vehicle production is made up of a number of interrelated measures. The protective effect of many of these measures, for example, quotas, local content plan, is difficult to quantify in dollar terms. These difficulties are heightened when estimates of the subsidy equivalent of the protective incidence of the assistance package are aggregated and then evaluated on a 'per employee' basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       The latest available estimates of assistance accorded to passenger motor vehicle production are contained in the Industries Assistance Commission's draft report 'Passenger Motor Vehicles and Components-Post 1984 Assistance Arrangements', released on 24 February 1981. Discussion of the effect of the assistance package on consumer prices and the allocation of productive resources is contained in Chapter 6 (especially pp 97-103) of the Commission's report. In appendix 8 of the report, the Commission discusses the assumptions under which its analysis has proceeded including some of the limitations of its approach.

      <para>
       (2) The latest available figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics based on the manufacturing census for 1978-79 estimate employment for the motor vehicles and parts industry at 76,664.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Industries Assistance Commission's analysis of employment in passenger vehicle production is contained on pp 47-48 of the draft report. From evidence received the Commission estimated that in March 1980 about 65,000 persons were employed in the production of passenger vehicles and components. Of these, approximately 60 per cent were employed by the five Plan manufacturers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission's estimates are broadly consistent with estimates by the Department of Industry and Commerce which indicate around 69,000 persons are currently employed in the industry-38,500 by the five Plan manufacturers, 400 in assembly outside the Plan and about 30,000 in over 700 establishments engaged in the production of automotive components.
      </para>
      <para>
       These figures cover employment in the manufacturing sector only and do not include employment in related areas such as importing distribution and servicing. Estimates provided to the Commission by the Dealer's Association indicated that in 1979 dealers employed about 70,000 persons. Employment by importers is estimated at 12,800 in December 1980.
      </para>
      <para>

These figures are the latest available from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Interpretation of the figures should take into account such factors as differences in education systems, the emphasis placed on part time education in Australia (particularly through apprenticeships) and deficiencies in the scope and coverage of the statistics. A description of how the education systems in each of the three countries are classified is contained in 'Classification of Educational Systems-Summary Volume' OECD Paris 1975.

       (2) (a) In Australia since 1974, tuition fees have not been imposed at tertiary institutions for vocationally oriented courses, or courses leading to awards. Most students at universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions are in this category, the notable exceptions being TAFE students enrolled in adult education courses. The recently announced decision that tuition fees be re-introduced in universities and colleges of advanced education for students undertaking degrees and diplomas subsequent to an initial tertiary qualification except for recognised double degree or diploma combinations and postgraduate students in receipt of Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards or holders of university and college of advanced education postgraduate awards will take effect for new enrolments from the beginning of 1982.

       Note: Visitors are not normally permitted to undertake employment here. In applying for entry, visitors are required to make a declaration that they will not seek employment or undertake formal studies during the period of their intended stay in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Students may undertake vacation employment and/or employment as an integral part of their course and/or in the form of practical experience at the completion of their courses. This is normally permitted where it is necessary to obtain registration or acceptance as a member of a professional body and where this necessary work experience cannot be gained in their own country. They may also undertake some part-time employment as long as this does not interfere with their academic progress.

       Temporary residents include high level staff for Australian branches of overseas companies, academics for educational and research institutions, entertainers and sportsmen and certain professional and technical workers with special expertise who are often required in the early stages of establishment of some new developmental enterprises. Figures are not available by category by period of stay but the majority of specialised workers come for short periods. Usually temporary residents are eligible to remain for periods up to four years. The dependants of working age of temporary residents are not prohibited from undertaking employment or studies in Australia. The working holiday maker schemes involve reciprocity and the work is incidental to the holiday.

       (3) Migrants entering Australia for permanent residence have the same entitlements as ordinary residents of Australia in regard to the matters raised. In more specific terms:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) housing-certain migrants and refugees are entitled to initial accommodation in migrant centres; family reunion categories are expected to be accommodated initially at least by a sponsoring close relative; generally permanent arrivals are eligible for State Government provided housing on the same basis as normal Australian residents, waiting periods varying from State to State;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) education-migrants and their dependants have the same access to education as other residents but in addition special programs of English language learning are available for both adults and children from funding provided mainly by the Commonwealth;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) employment-the facilities of the Commonwealth Employment Service are available for all migrants and refugees;
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) social security-permanent arrivals are entitled to all social security provisions on the same basis as other Australian residents-residential requirements apply in certain instances;
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) health-most medical and hospital organisations have special arrangements for newly arrived migrants ensuring that they can acquire adequate cover from the date of arrival without any waiting period. The Government has decided that migrants and refugees will be eligible for bulk billing for medical services for six months after arrival. Migrants and refugees are subject to health screening before visas are issued;
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) other areas-an extensive range of programs is available to facilitate the settlement of migrants and refugees including those covered by recommendations of the Galbally Report.
      </para>
      <para>
       Access to matters covered by (a) to (f) by temporary arrivals varies according to the condition of their entry.

       (1) Further to my question without notice to him on 9 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1519) in relation to the weakness of section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, is he now able to confirm that (a) a $16.5m tax-free profit was made by the Bell group of companies for its sale of shares in Elder Smith Goldsborough Mort Ltd, and that this transaction reveals a weakness in this section of the Act; (b) in November of 1979 the Bell group made a similar tax-free profit of $11m by selling a subsidiary company, Bell Air Charter, which has purchased shares in Ansett Transport Industries Ltd for the Bell group during a takeover attempt and (c) in August 1980 the Bond group used a similar device to make a tax-free profit of $32m by selling a subsidiary, Narla prospecting company, which had purchased shares in the White Industries organisation.

       (1) and (2) As I mentioned in my reply to the honourable member's question of 9 April 1981 concerning this matter, I cannot precisely affirm or deny a particular tax position of an individual taxpayer. That is because the secrecy provisions of the income tax law prevent the Commissioner of Taxation from disclosing information about the affairs of any taxpayer.

      <para>
       (3) As I also said in my answer to the honourable member's question of 9 April 1981, I have asked the Commissioner of Taxation to examine the question of possible weakness in section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The matter isby no means free of complexity but I expect to receive the Commissioner's advice soon.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       A number of PJT inquiries including those into stevedoring, spare parts, petroleum products and wool broking found that prices charged by the companies, or some of the companies, concerned were higher than justified or that proposed price increases were not wholly justified.
      </para>
      <para>
       In some of those inquiries the PJT determined precisely the justified prices for particular products, but in other cases it indicated the order of price reduction warranted or simply invited companies to review their mark-ups in particular areas of activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of petroleum products the oil companies at times have been unable to obtain in particular localities, because of market conditions, not only the prices they had proposed to the PJT but the prices found justified by the PJT.
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of these and other considerations it is not possible to quantify the savings that may have flowed to consumers or to primary industry as a result of companies' complying with the PJT's findings. Savings to consumers that may have resulted from particular PJT inquiries need to be weighed, against the cost of the PJT's operations, including the direct cost to the Budget, the cost to business in complying with PJT procedures and the wider effects of price regulation on business investment and the market place.

In the interim, will the Minister protest to the Maltese Government about this possible desecration?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       I am aware of the recent reports in the media that the Maltese Government wants to bulldoze the graves of Commonwealth war dead in Malta. The reports are incorrect.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth War Graves Commission in England, of which Australia and other Commonwealth countries are corporate members, is responsible for the Commonwealth war graves throughout the world, including those in Malta. There are also war graves of nine foreign countries and some 5,000 non-war British burials in the Malta cemeteries.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1979, the Maltese Government asked the British to remove the remains of the 7,303 buried in the Capuccini, Pembroke and Pieta cemeteries, and concentrate them in the Mtarfa cemetery where there are 1,440 graves. 200 Australian graves are involved. Considerable extra land would need to be provided at Mtarfa and the cost would run into some millions of dollars.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia and the other Commonwealth countries are opposed to the proposed move of the graves except if it can be shown (and it has not so far been done by the Maltese Government) that there was such an overriding and urgent public need for the land to be used for other essential purposes as to justify disturbance of the graves. Australia has been kept fully informed on the negotiations which have been going on with the Maltese Government since the original request was made in 1979. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has received many requests from relatives to transfer the remains of war dead to their home country. However, the Commission's policy, which was established after the First World War and reaffirmed after the Second World War, is that the graves should not be disturbed except on the grounds of overriding public interest. Agreements have been negotiated with many Foreign Governments on these lines. The Commission is bound to adhere to this policy which was laid down by its Participating Governments, including Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       A detailed costing of the transfer of the war graves of all Australian veterans back to Australia and the establishment of a National Cemetery for this purpose, would not be practical or productive in view of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's policy. There are Australian war graves in over 2,500 cemeteries throughout the World and it is possible that a very large proportion of the relatives of the war dead would strongly object to the disturbance of the remains. All Australian war dead are commemorated in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The Australian Government has also established and maintains Gardens of Remembrance in most of the capital cities for the commemoration of those veterans whose deaths were war-related and who are not officially commemorated in civil cemeteries.

       (2) Under section 82AAT of the Income Tax Assessment Act a person may be allowed a deduction, up to a limit of $1,200 in an income year, for contributions made in the year to a superannuation fund approved by the Commissioner of Taxation under paragraph 23 (ja) or section 79 of the Act. The deduction is not available where, in relation to the person's service in that year, it could resonably be expected that superannuation benefits would be provided on his or her retirement (or for his or her dependants in the event of death) under an employer-sponsored superannuation fund or statutory superannuation scheme referred to in the legislation.

      <para>
       It is not clear from the form letter referred to whether, and to what extent, the persons referred to would be eligible for the deduction, but the Commissioner of Taxation would provide advice to persons concerned once the relevant facts were placed before him.

       (2) Over the next two financial years the greater proportion of PIBA's funding requirements is expected to be raised by public borrowings (as has been the case in the past). To date, funds totalling $101m, repayable over eight years, have been deposited with PIBA from the Income Equalisaton Deposits Trust Account. (Details of such deposits are provided in Annual Reports on the operation of Part II of the Primary Industry Bank Act 1977 which are tabled in the Parliament.) The Government has undertaken to continue its support for PIBA by the provision of a three year funding commitment for the bank's operations. This commitment will cover the three financial years beginning 1981-82 and discussions between PIBA and the Commonwealth on the means for giving effect to the commitment are now taking place.

       (2) and (3) In cases where the shareholdings of nominee companies could be of significance in relation to the requirements of foreign investment policy, companies concerned have been asked to ascertain whether the beneficial ownership of the shares they hold in the company is Australian or foreign. Companies have provided such information on request. Section 36 of the Foreign Takeovers Act provides legislative power for information relevant to foreign takeover matters to be sought as necessary but experience to date has been that it has not been necessary to take action in pursuance of that Section. With regard to the provisions of the Companies Bill 1981, Section 261 provides companies with the power to obtain information as to the beneficial ownership of their shares.

      <para>
       (1) The decision to mint the commemorative koala coin was announced on 10 July 1979.
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The number of gold proof coins produced was effectively limited by the Mint's capacity to produce coins of that type bearing in mind the overall production program. No restriction was placed on the production of the uncirculated coin.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The closing date for gold proof coins was 19 September 1980 and for gold uncirculated coins 12 December 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that at 1 January 1981 39,192 gold proof coins and 195,247 gold uncirculated coins had been despatched from the Mint.
      </para>

       (6) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that IPEC Pty Ltd and Wards Express were contracted to deliver the gold coins.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that arrangements to deliver the coins were not cancelled but IPEC withdrew from the contract stating that the delivery of gold coins was not compatible with IPEC's normal business. Wards Express continued to deliver gold coins.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) and (9) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that a contract in writing for IPEC to deliver gold coins was signed on 16 October 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that IPEC took the first delivery of gold coins on 21 October 1980 and continued on a regular basis until the last delivery was taken on 17 December 1980. During this period IPEC received from the Mint 22,238 gold proof coins and 9,067 uncirculated gold coins.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that there were delays of over one week between IPEC's receipt and delivery of some coin consignments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that IPEC returned 6,172 coin consignments to the Mint, 72 because IPEC could not complete delivery and 6,100 when the company withdrew from the contract.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) All these consignments were returned on or before 23 December 1980. These consignments were accumulated over approximately one month.

      <para>
       (16) The Controller of the Mint has been advised by IPEC that they reported the Brisbane loss to the Queensland Police on 16 December 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       (17) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that the Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian Police are actively engaged in investigating both the Brisbane and Melbourne gold coin losses and at this stage the results of these investigations are confidential to the police forces and IPEC. The involvement of the Australian Federal Police is limited to making enquiries in Canberra on behalf of State police forces.
      </para>
      <para>
       (18) Yes (to all parts).
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (22) It was a condition of the contracts with the carriers that appropriate insurance arrangements be made by them. The particular insurers concerned are a matter between the carriers and those insurers. The market price for the gold coins varies greatly but a guideline price from the larger coin dealers would be in the vicinity of $600 for the proof coin and about $250 for the uncirculated coin. Those prices apply to both dates.
      </para>
      <para>
       (23) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that the total current market value for all the gold coins reported as missing is approximately $52,000.

      <para>
       (24) The Controller of the Mint has advised me that all written enquiries to the Mint about delays in despatch of gold coins will be answered. At this stage approximately 7,000 replies have been made.

      <para>
       The Commonwealth's commitment to ensure an efficient and effective national air transport system, its obligations with regard to international agreements relating to civil aviation, and the need to regulate standards to ensure safety, together with the sheer magnitude of the task of operating a capital city trunk route airport, make it unlikely that ownership and control would be passed to a body other than a State Government, City Council or a State Statutory Body.

Among other things we agreed to set up a South Australian Airfields Committee comprising both Commonwealth and State officials. The task of this Committee will include oversighting the implementation of agreed recommendations of the Joint Government Advisory Committee on Adelaide's Airline-Airport Requirements. Two important points made by that Committee were:

These fares were introduced in 1979 to extend the benefits travelling to and from non-gateway ports. The Australian-originating 'add-on' fares offer a 30 per cent discount off the normal economy fare for domestic travel in conjunction with advance purchase international air travel. The 'See-Australia' fares are available for travel within Australia in conjunction with international promotional fares such as apex or excursion fares at 30 per cent discount off the normal economy fare.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) At 1 March 1981, 2,538 applicants were awaiting settlement of a loan upon the expiration of the waiting period. The loans were due for settlement between March 1981 and December 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) New lending is financed mainly from internally generated funds, of which the major element is principal repayments by current borrowers that are received throughout the year. Thus, it is not practicable to nominate a sum available at 1 March 1981 for loans. The Budget estimate of funds to become available for lending in 1980-81 was $111.5 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Loans are normally repayable over a maximum term of 32 years by equal monthly instalments. Interest is charged at the rate of 3.75 per cent per annum on the first $12,000 at 7.25 per cent per annum on amounts between $12,001 and $15,000 and at 10 per cent on the amount of the loan exceeding $15,000. The average interest rate on a maximum loan of $25,000 is approximately 6.9 per cent per annum. The normal monthly instalment on a loan of $25,000 is $160.75.

The Department of National Development and Energy is monitoring production by means of periodic reports from experimenters, and will be conducting workshops from time to time to enable experimenters to compare notes and assist each other through sharing of experience. That Department has also produced a brochure for experimenters which includes safety matters both in respect of the production of ethanol and of its experimental use in internal combustion engines.

Of this group, it is estimated that 30,000 have already reached age pension age and are included in 1(a). A further 188,000 have not yet reached the qualifying age for service pension. The cost of abolishing the income test in respect of the remainder, who would qualify for service pension, that is 54,000 veterans and 39,960 wives, is estimated at $267.3m in a full year.

       (2) Yes. In State offices (other than Western Australia) all extensions except those of senior officers are barred to STD. In the Fremantle office, technical difficulties prevent the barring of extensions to STD, whilst in Perth subscription to the PABX rests with Department of Veterans' Affairs which has been advised that there are no objections to total barring.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Central Office very few extensions are barred to STD. Personal trunk calls are required to be booked through the departmental switchboard operator. Prior to booking the call the caller must obtain approval from the accountant. The switchboard operator will then place the booking through the trunks operator. After the call, the cost is obtained and a voucher forwarded to the accountant who then debits the caller with the cost of the call. See also (3) below.

       (2), (3) and (4) Following the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Commonwealth has decided to discontinue specific purpose grants to the States for urban public transport after 30 June 1981. At the Premiers' Conference on 4 May 1981, the Commonwealth announced that the States' overall entitlements for 1981-82 under the tax sharing arrangements would include a specific adjustment to take account of the termination of a number of specific purpose payments, including $50m for urban public transport.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whereas the urban public transport program was due to expire in 1982-83, the $50m incremental adjustment to the 1981-82 tax sharing arrangements now forms part of the base for the calculation of total tax sharing entitlements in future years. The new arrangements allow each State to determine how much will be allocated for urban public transport in light of its own assessment of relative State priorities.

      <para>
       (1) The underwriting loss of $73m referred to by the honourable member was incurred by private sector direct underwriters for the calendar year 1979. The underwriting loss for the year 1978-79 was approximately $38m. I am aware of the comment made by the Insurance Commissioner that a predicted $100m underwriting loss for the year ended 30 June 1980 was conservative. Actual figures now available for this period show that private sector direct underwriters incurred underwriting losses totalling approximately $151m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) For the 1978-79 and 1979-80 financial years non-underwriting profits for private sector direct underwriters were approximately $254m and $316m respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is well known that a very competitive situation has existed in the industry for some time, with resulting pressure on underwriting results, and the industry is having to cope with other factors adversely affecting these results. However I am aware of no reason to suggest that the industry does not have the overall financial strength to meet its obligations. It might be noted that, on the basis of data compiled by the Insurance Commissioner, in the two years 1978-79 and 1979-80 net profit from the insurance business of private sector direct underwriters totalled $317m. I would also draw the honourable member's attention to pages 18 and 19 of the Insurance Commissioner's Annual Report for 1979-80 which indicate that in recent years up to 1978-79 (the latest year for which this information is available) there has been continued overall improvement in the assessed solvency margins of direct underwriters in the private sector.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In a media release dated 30 November 1979 the Trade Practices Commission stated it had been prepared to take proceedings against News Limited because its proposal to acquire marginally more than 50 per cent of the shares in Herald and Weekly Times Limited would have given it control of that company and consequently one-company dominance in a number of markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am not aware of statements of the kind referred to in the question and a search by my Department of the press clippings it has relating to the attempted takeover did not, I understand, reveal reference to such statements in the press reports. I am informed, however, that News Limited issued a statement on 22 November 1979 which said, in part ''Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of the News group of companies, today announced that in view of events in the last 48 hours, including the unwarranted intervention of the Trade Practices Commission, the News group at this time does not intend to make an offer to all the ordinary shareholders of Herald and Weekly Times Ltd to acquire marginally in excess of 50 per cent of the issued ordinary capital of that company.''.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) See my answer to (1).
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) I am unable to comment on the reasons of the Victorian State Government in deciding to set up the inquiry referred to, other than to note that the Victorian Premier was reported as saying, at the time the inquiry was announced, that the inquiry had not been prompted by the News Limited/Herald and Weekly Times takeover bid.

       (4) The leaflet was published to inform the public of development proposals at Perth Airport and seek comments, particularly on environmental issues. Extracts of the Joint Government Committee recommendation relevant to this purpose were included in the pamphlet. The public has previously been informed of the recommendations of the Committee in a press release in August 1979 and its 'Report on the Aviation Requirements for the Perth Region' which has been made available to the public through the Australian Government Publishing Service.

       (6) The new international terminal project is still in the early planning stages and work cannot commence until the project first receives specific Government approval and then Parliamentary approval after examination by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works (PWC). A master plan document for Perth Airport, will be produced prior to the PWC hearing. It is not anticipated that the findings of the master plan will necessitate a reversal of the decision on the location of the new international terminal complex.

       At this stage there have been no requests made for assessments from such bodies as referred to by the honourable member. If at a later stage of consideration of the question of the future of the Factory assessments are considered relevant, they will be sought. It could be expected that a private sector owner could use the Bendigo facilities to greatly expand activity in support of large scale industrial and minerals developments, as well as continue to engage in defence work, and thereby provide continuing employment opportunities in Bendigo.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) An unidentified author alleges in the article that the Permanent Head of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has refused to have evidence of pesticides summarised and placed on files on pesticide claims, and that as a consequence, medical practitioners have insufficient information to give an informed and balanced opinion on the possibility of disability claims being attributed to pesticide poisoning. The author also alleges that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has refused to release a report said to have been prepared for the Department by Dr Keith Fleming.
      </para>
      <para>
       The facts are that the Department has been gathering information on the long-term effects of herbicides on human health since well before December 1979 when the herbicides controversy arose in Australia and has been circulating this information throughout the Repatriation system.
      </para>
      <para>
       The so called 'report' by Dr Fleming is a compilation of extracts from scientific and other articles which were obtained from Mr John Evans of Melbourne, an adviser to the Vietnam Veterans Association, and which, in his opinion, supported the Association's claims. Subsequent independent evaluation of the compilation indicated that the compilation did not present an adequate up-to-date and comprehensive coverage of the scientific literature on the subject.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, copies of the full texts of the reports and articles quoted by Mr John Evans together with a number of other scientific reports have been distributed to Departmental Medical Officers dealing with claims of health effects from contact with toxic chemicals in Vietnam.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) A search has revealed that the Department has received the following papers from what is referred to as herbicide manufacturing interests:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) A copy of a paper presented to the United Services Club in Brisbane on 19 March 1980 by the Queensland Manager of Nufarm Chemicals which is entitled 'Do You Want Three Feeds a Day?'
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) A copy of a paper presented to the Pesticides Science Group by the Chairman of the South Australian Division of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia on 16 March 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) A letter dated 30 April 1980, addressed to my predecessor, the Hon. A. E. Adermann, M.P., from I.C.I. Australia Limited to which was attached a one page summary concerning the toxicology of the herbicides ''Gramoxone'' and ''Reglone''.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) A letter dated 23 February 1981, addressed to me from the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia to which was attached a booklet entitled 'Public Concerns About 2,4,5-T' by W. R. Mullison, Ph.D.
      </para>
      <para>
       This material is available and could be tabled if required.

      <para>
       (d) My Department seeks to ensure that all relevant scientific evidence is taken into account by Departmental Medical Officers when giving opinions under the terms of section 48 of the Repatriation Act, by providing them with copies of published articles dealing with the possible toxic effects of herbicides and other toxic chemicals. Repatriation Boards and delegates of the Commission are well aware and have been reminded that all of this material is available to them whenever they think it could be relevant to a particular claim.

       With regard to each of the 7 recommendations the position is as follows:

      <para>
       Recommendation No. 1-Statutory Interest on Solicitors' Trust Accounts-In so far as the Australian Capital Territory is concerned the recommendation has not been accepted. The recommendation could not be adopted without prior consultation with banks and the Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory. In so far as the recommendation concerns participating States it has been brought to their attention.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation No. 2-Estimates of Expenditure-The recommendation as it relates to Commonwealth funding has not been accepted. The recommendation has been brought to the attention of participating States.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation No. 3-Grants to Voluntary and Community Legal Services-In accordance with the recommendation the Government has established an on-going funding program for these bodies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation No. 4-Grants for Migrant Legal Education-I brought this recommendation to the attention of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and officers of his Department have had discussions in relation to the matter with officers of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. With the assistance of these officers the Department has prepared orientation information for newly arrived migrants explaining aspects of the law that are likely to be of concern to them.

      <para>
       Recommendation No. 5-Aboriginal Legal Aid-The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, to which this recommendation was made, did not agree that a national secretariat of Aboriginal legal services should be established-see Chapter 17 of the Committee's Report tabled on 27 August 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation No. 6-Provision of Legal Advice-In the Australian Capital Territory the recommendation as it relates to the availability of legal advice has not been formally accepted by the Legal Aid Commission as the Commission has always acted generally in accordance with the recommendation. The Commission has not accepted the recommendation as it relates to voluntary and community based services as it considers that the only community based service in the Territory duplicates the legal advice services provided by the Commission. In so far as the recommendations concern participating States it has been brought to their attention.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation No. 7-Administrative Review Council-In relation to the Australian Capital Territory similar recommendations to those contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the recommendation have been made by the Administrative Review Council-see pages 22 and 23 of The Council's Fourth Annual Report tabled on 18 September 1980. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Council. In so far as these recommendations concern participating States it has been brought to their attention.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. Special telephone handset equipment for the totally deaf called the Porta Printer II has been available to the public through a private company, Intercept Communications, P.O. Box 297, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, priced in the range $800-$1,000. Telecom Australia permitted its connection to the telephone network and, I am advised, some 80 units have been sold to date.
      </para>
      <para>
       A recent upsurge of demand for the equipment in the United States of America has exhausted supplies, including items earmarked for Australia. Alternative equipment, the Porta Printer Plus, could be available through Intercept Communications by mid 1981. One of these printers has already been leased by Telecom for evaluation and testing for com- patibility with the Porta Printer II. Telecom's intention, as part of its contribution to the International Year of the Disabled Person, is to act as a distributing agent for the unit.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) The Government is concerned to improve the opportunities and access to services of disabled people wherever practicable. Telecom has prepared a booklet, entitled 'International Year of Disabled Persons 1981-Telecom Australia's Program of Activities', which includes information about handsets for the deaf. Several thousand copies have already been distributed, both inside and outside of Telecom, and to relevant Government Departments and Authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government currently has under consideration the question of policy on practical steps that Departments should take to assist the disabled. I will advise the honourable member in due course of the outcome with respect to the provision of receivers in Departments that can be accessed by the totally deaf.

The Minister has informed the NAC that he recognised its concern, and that a joint DAA/ADC Steering Group has been established to ensure that the ADC will have adequate resources to manage the programs to be transferred. This transfer with effect from 1 July 1981 is a firm Government commitment designed to assist Aboriginal people to achieve greater management and determination of their own affairs.

      <para>
       (2) As I have explained to the Parliament on several occasions, the Government's overall economic objectives have required adjustments to the pace of proceeding with the objectives in the 1976 White Paper. Indeed, the 1976 White Paper emphasised that the provisional allocations for Defence Outlay in the period 1976-81 were subject to review and adjustment according to actual timing of project developments, Budget consideration and the circumstances prevailing at the time that major decisions need to be taken. The planning, in the 1976 White Paper, to increase defence expenditure on Defence facilities to over 7 per cent of total Defence expenditure in 1980-81 must be seen in this context.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to the need for general restraint on public expenditure as part of the Government's overall economic strategy, factors such as the timing of decisions on facilities for the Australian Defence Force Academy and the New Tactical Fighter and the need to consider the recommendations of the report 'Accommodation for Married Servicemen', by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, inevitably affected previously planned achievements.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. In answer to Question No. 273 (Hansard, 4 March 1981) I stated that I had been advised that Bankcard credit charges are not compounded daily, that is, interest is not charged on interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The interest charged by Bankcard depends upon whether the debt is generated by a cash advance or a purchase of merchandise. I am advised that if a debt of $2,000 is generated by a cash advance on 1 January and is not reduced over the ensuing twelve month period the interest charged for that period would be $358.98 which is an effective rate of 17.95 per cent per annum. If the debt is generated by a purchase of merchandise the interest charged would vary between $331.78 and $359.39, depending on the length of the interest free period; this is an effective rate varying between 16.59 per cent and 17.97 per cent per annum. It should be noted, however, that these examples assume a departure from the condition upon which a Bankcard is issued, that a card holder may make a payment of at least 5 per cent of the amount owing at the end of each settlement period. If this condition were met the amounts of interest quoted above would be reduced accordingly.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. However I am advised that if the interest charged were to be compounded daily, which as I have indicated is not the case, it would produce an effective rate of 19.7 per cent per annum. Such a compounding would result in an annual interest charge of $394 compared with the amounts referred to in the answer to the second part of this question. For the sake of completeness let me stress that I am advised that there is no compounding effect of any kind in the computation of Bankcard interest. After an initial credit charge of 1.5 per cent for extending credit on merchandise purchases (which would normally be applied on the second monthly statement in which the balance outstanding in respect of a particular purchase appears) and for cash advances Bankcard interest is computed on reducing principal at daily rests basis. The total interest component (including the 1.5 per cent credit charge referred to above) included in amounts owing is segregated and disregarded for the purpose of interest calculations. I understand that this differs from many methods of computing interest in Australia.

       (4) In his Press release of 4 March 1976 the then Treasurer announced that the Government had agreed, in principle, to the introduction of a natural disaster insurance scheme, and had approved the establishment of a working party of officials to formulate a detailed scheme in consultation with the insurance industry and, as necessary, with the States. In December 1976 a discussion paper based on the working party's report was tabled in Parliament for the purpose of seeking public comment on a possible natural disaster insurance scheme. Following a detailed assessment of this matter, including comments received from the States, the insurance industry and other interested parties, the Government concluded that a natural disaster insurance scheme of the type outlined in the discussion paper would not be a cost-effective way of assisting in solutions to the problems identified and that a number of practical measures dealing more directly with the problems and involving less Government intervention would be more appropriate. Work on this matter is proceeding. Further background on the Government's decisions in this area is contained in my press release of 17 January 1979 and in a Policy Information Paper which I tabled in Parliament on 4 June 1979.

       (2) (a) Both Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd and the Iwasaki company have provided written advice that employees of Iwasaki Sangyo are not currently undertaking fencing repairs on or within Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd's property. The Iwasaki company is currently undertaking fencing of its own property, which has a common boundary with one of the Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd properties.

       (b) These companies have also advised that the only cattle grazed on Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd's property in recent times were those owned by Setu Nominees Pty Ltd. These cattle were transferred to one of the Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd properties from the Iwasaki company's property, where they had been agisted during drought, about 12 months ago at about the time Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd acquired the property from Setu Nominees Pty Ltd, the previous owner. Under the provisions of the sale agreement, Setu Nominees Pty Ltd retained the right to graze cattle on the property for up to 12 months. In September last year, 10 Iwasaki bullocks which were inadvertently included in the above muster were returned to the Iwasaki company's property. Setu Nominees Pty Ltd has vacated the Maryvale Forest Pty Ltd property in accordance with the provisions of the sale agreement.

      <para>
       (1) I understand that most major trading banks currently have a 'prime' rate of 15 per cent per annum for advances drawn under limits of $100,000 and above. This is in the nature of a reference rate. The precise rate charged to a particular customer is a matter for negotiation between the bank and the customer.

       (2) There is no such recommendation currently before me.
      </para>

       (3) See answer to (2). However, the release of Statutory Reserve Deposit Funds to trading banks would not in itself affect the interest rate at which trading banks or, more importanlty, savings banks can lend for housing.

       (4) In his statement to Parliament on 30 April 1981 on the outcome of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Prime Minister said, inter alia, that, 'significant room for staffing reductions exists in our diplomatic missions overseas. The staffing of the London and Washington posts overseas will be cut by 232 and by 75 staff respectively . . . '. The way in which this decision is to be implemented, insofar as the Trade Commissioner Service is concerned, is presently being investigated but it can be assumed that the intent will be to minimise the effect on Australian exporters. In addition to the number of staff serving under the Trade Commissioner Act has been reduced by just over 2 per cent as a result of decisions flowing from the Review of Commonwealth Functions. This may require a re-distribution of staffing resources but such re-distribution would be directed towards maximising overall efficiency including the provision of commercial intelligence to the Australian business community.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Preliminary data available from the States concerning new courses commenced under the Transition Program in 1980 indicate that 247 courses began in the TAFE sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       A major purpose of the Program in schools is to assist development of appropriate changes in curriculum, including the development of alternative courses for young people whose needs are not adequately met by traditional courses. While these measures are expected to encourage more students to continue longer in secondary education, the major effect so far has been to improve the capacity of schools to deal adequately with the needs of students already in the schools. It is not possible to specify a particular number of courses or places provided in schools from Commonwealth funds. However, it is estimated that at least 4,000 students in secondary schools were undertaking courses receiving significant financial support under the Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding for the Program is approximately equally divided between school based and TAFE programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Courses in TAFE institutions provided for about 4,400 students. Many thousands of students in schools benefited from developments supported under the Program in 1980. These include development and extension of alternative course offerings and work experience programs, improvement of career guidance and education, programs of city visits for country children, provision of vocational course equipment and facilities, teacher development and transition curriculum development.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The average cost to the Commonwealth of providing these courses in TAFE in 1980 (excluding Commonwealth benefits and allowances paid to students and trainees) was of the order of $1,500 per student. It should be noted that courses varied in length from twelve weeks to forty weeks, depending on arrangements in individual States and institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Sample data suggests that about three-quarters of trainees in TAFE courses under the Program were receiving Unemployment Benefit before commencing courses.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) It is expected that about 6,000 places will be provided in courses in the TAFE sector under the Program in 1981. This is 1,600 more than in 1980. The range of activities established in schools will continue and develop. At least 8,000 students in secondary schools are undertaking courses receiving financial support under the Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) See reply to (5) above. Most participants in courses funded under the Program either have experienced or are regarded as likely to experience transition problems. Activities in the school sector will significantly affect many thousands of students, although few will be enrolled in new places which can be specifically identified as being fully funded by the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       A good part of activities funded by the Commonwealth under the Transition Program supplements similar activities funded by the States.

       The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not collect, on a regular basis, statistics of tradesmen. It did carry out a sample survey of private and government employers in September 1977 to obtain information on the numbers of apprentices and employees working as tradesmen, but it was subject to certain significant limitations. For further information refer to ABS publication 'Apprentices and Employees Working as Tradesmen, September 1977', Catalogue No. 6233.0.

       In addition, in a survey of the construction industry in respect of the year 1978-79 the ABS collected details of on-site employment by private sector construction establishments at 30 June 1979. While this information does not differentiate between skilled and semi-skilled tradesmen it incorporates a classification of 21 occupations. For further information refer to ABS publications 'Private Sector Construction Establishment, Details of Operation by Industry Class, 1978-79', Catalogue No. 8714.0-822.0.

It should be noted that statistics on migrant arrivals by occupation are based on the recognised qualifications of some migrants and the stated occupations of others. In addition statistics on migrant arrivals in the building and construction occupations do not indicate that all these workers are employed in the construction industry, as some workers in the building trades are employed in other industries. Similarly not all workers in the construction industry are employed in the building and construction trades, e.g. electrical tradesmen, metal workers.

       (1) Is it a fact that a number of Goverment departments and statutory bodies, including (a) Treasury, (b) Finance, (c) Industrial Relations and (d) the Industries Assistance Commission, are having difficulty in recruiting suitably qualified staff.
      </para>

       (3) The economics area generally is one in which recruitment difficulties are being experienced at the moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) There is currently a shortfall in the supply of qualified personnel graduating from tertiary institutions in some specialised categories, such as economics. Private sector employers, competing for the same scarce resources, are also experiencing recruitment difficulties in these fields. While a proportion of resignations from the Service represents trained personnel transferring to the private sector there is no evidence to suggest that this trend is on the increase. There is also no indication of a significant ''brain drain'' overseas from the Public Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The present situation is primarily the result of an overall shortage of specialised staff and not the conditions of employment of Commonwealth public servants.

Four State Governments have adopted the Code of General Principles with minor revisions in respect of their own employees. The Commonwealth has no detailed knowledge of the extent of adoption of the code by private industry. It is believed, however, that there is an increasing awareness both in the State Governments and private industry of the financial and humanitarian benefits to be gained from the implementation of properly structured and implemented occupational safety and health programs.

      <para>
       (2) Yes. There are nine localities in the Brisbane metropolitan area where no messenger delivery is available, namely-Brookfield, Upper Brookfield, Bellbowrie, Anstead, Pullenvale, Moggill, Pinjarra Hills, Belmont and Chandler. These are lightly populated fringe areas with very little demand for telegram services. Other offices in Brisbane provide either a four hour or same day messenger delivery service.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) and (b) Yes. (c) In 1978 the minimum rate was $1.80 for telegrams addressed to a telex number or for delivery by mail. The charge of $3.30 was for a 12 word telegram requiring messenger delivery.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Addressed to a residential or business address-$4.30; addressed to a telegraphic code address-$3.30; addressed to a telephone number-$3.00; addressed to a postal address for delivery by mail-$2.50; addressed to a telex number-$2.00.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The number of telegrams handled in 1979-80 was 5.4 million-a decline of 7.5 million since 1975-76.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The charge for a 12 word messenger delivery telegram has risen from $1.84 in 1976 to $4.30 in 1980-an increase of 133.7 per cent. The current minimum charge for a telegram addressed to a telex number, however, is only $2.00-an increase of 38.8 per cent. Although increased charges have undoubtedly had an effect on the demand for the public telegraph service, the effect of the increased use and availability of high quality telephone, telex, data, facsimile and other communications services has been of equal significance. This reflects a world wide trend.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) (a) Prior to 1979 the service standard for ordinary rate telegrams was 30 minutes from time of lodgement to issue for delivery. Since 1979, the standard at most metropolitan and large country offices is 4 hours from time of lodgement to the actual delivery time. These standards are the maximum, rather than minimum, delivery times to be met in 90 per cent of cases. (b) and (c) Yes. In all cases, delivery times for telegrams which are telephoned or telexed to addressees are very much lower.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) and (9) The level of service has changed very little in recent years except for the general unavailability of a weekend delivery service outside metropolitan areas. Telegrams may still be lodged across a telegraph or post office counter during business hours and by telephone or telex on a 24 hour basis from virtually anywhere in Australia. Messenger delivery is limited to business hours outside the metropolitan areas where porterage fees apply after hours, but telegrams can be delivered over a 24 hour period anywhere in Australia by telephone or telex. Higher standards of service would need to take account of the demand for and cost of providing the service.

It is intended that the funds be administered through a joint program approach and on a project basis, in consultation with government and non-government education authorities in the States and the Northern Territory.

       (3) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that when a similar question was answered by a number of Ministers in 1976, it was claimed that obtaining the information would involve collection of detailed information from a diversity of records and sources, and would therefore require unjustifiable use of staff resources.

      <para>
       (1) to (4) I am aware that a similar question was asked by the honourable member of a number of Ministers in 1976, and that the honourable member was informed that the information requested could not be supplied because the task would have required a major commitment of staff resources which could not be justified in terms of the time and expense involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       The development of the Forward Estimates has advanced since 1976 but these estimates are not designed to provide information of the nature requested by the honourable member. I advise that extraction of that detailed information from a diversity of records and sources would still involve substantial and unjustifiable expense in time and resources.

      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation oceanographic research vessel Sprightly undertook research off Western Australia for approximately five months each year from 1975-76 to 1977-78. The overall cost of this vessel in this period was $806,700 in 1975-76, $758,700 in 1976-77 and $468,500 in 1977-78. It is not possible to identify the Western Australian component of these costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Science and Technology is also involved, through the public interest provisions of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act, with a three year research and development project grant amounting to $225,000 for the production of freshwater crayfish in Western Australia. The grant was announced in February 1981.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Anaconda II was the vessel selected by the South Australian Government in consultation with the Commonwealth Government for the deployment of Australian fishing zone observers aboard Japanese vessels operating off South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) See (2).
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The vessel is required to carry four observers to locate and board licensed Japanese tuna longliners operating off the South Australian coast in order to obtain information on the size composition and biology of the Japanese catch and technical information on their fishing operations. Under the terms of the contract, the Commonwealth is not liable to the yacht's owner for sums additional to the basic daily rate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Eight crew consisting of experienced local seamen were on board for the first voyage lasting 13 days. The charter rate was all inclusive. Wages and personal insurance are matters for the crew and vessel owner.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Three observers and one Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation biologist.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The only personnel carried on the vessel for the two voyages were Commonwealth and State officers together with the crew.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) (a) Voyage 1 undertaken from 23.4.81 to 5.5.81. (b) Voyage 2 undertaken from 21.5.81 to 28.5.81. No further voyages are contemplated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) All Commonwealth requirements were complied with in the use of the vessel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) (a) Six knots. (b) Approximately 4-5 knots.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Speeds vary according to the operation being undertaken, e.g. 9-10 knots for speed setting line, 3-5 knots for speed retrieving line. Tuna longline vessels are normally stationary (adrift) for approximately 4 hours daily. In the observer operation the question of pursuit does not arise. Boardings of vessels by observers are facilitated by the master of the foreign vessel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) It is understood that the initial construction cost was $100,000, but replacement value is now conservatively estimated at $500,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) It was the cheapest arrangement. Few suitable vessels were available for charter in South Australia with sufficient range, size and deep seagoing capabilities for operations in the Great Australian Bight. The tuna season was at its height and local fishermen were unwilling to make their vessels available for a charter fee that would be well below the returns they could obtain from fishing.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of the three vessels available for the charter, two were motor vessels priced at $2,000 per day. The Anaconda II although a sailing vessel, met the requirements for the charter, especially for deep seagoing work and its capacity to accommodate crew and observers at least cost. There were no reports of the Anaconda II having difficulty in satisfactorily completing all the necessary manoeuvres to enable observers to perform their tasks amongst the Japanese vessels.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) Following consultation with the South Australian Tender Board, it was decided not to call tenders because of the time that would be lost in arranging charters to meet the deadline for the commencement of the exercise.

      <para>
       (1) and (2) During 1980 and 1981 funds are being made available for disabled young people in the Northern Territory under programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission and under the Transition from School to Work Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Commonwealth Schools Commission's programs, allocations to the Northern Territory for 1980 included $119,000 for government special schools, and $13,500 for residential institutions. Allocations for 1981 include $123,500 for government special schools, $14,500 for residential institutions and $10,500 for the program for the integration of handicapped children into regular schools. In addition, in 1981, the Northern Territory will share in a new program of assistance for the severely handicapped but individual State and Territory allocations are not yet available.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Transition from School to Work Program, projects to attract funding are initiated by the Northern Territory authorities and are submitted to the Commonwealth for approval. In 1981 $3,200 has been earmarked to help improve the prospects of handicapped students by giving increased attention to literacy and numeracy skills in school and by offering work experience placements. However it is expected that disabled young people would also benefit from projects of a more general nature. Under the Transition Program the Northern Territory received a total of $95,599 in 1980 and has received $112,860 so far in 1981.

       (2) (b) Implemention of the Government's decisions announced in the Prime Minister's statement of 30 April 1981 is expected to result in reductions in the order of 16,000 to 17,000 in the number of Commonwealth Government employees. It is estimated that some 7,000 to 8,000 of the reduction will be Public Service Act employees. Details of savings at the various levels are not available at this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The table illustrates changes within the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions for the period 30 June 1975 to 30 June 1980. The changes in the relevant proportions of the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions of the Service can be attributed to a number of factors such as different work arrangements, the nature of the work done, the impact of technological change, as well as staffing reductions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Those Second Division staff identified as excess to their department's requirements as a result of decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions to abolish the functions for which they are responsible are covered by the provisions and associated procedures of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act and the Public Service Arbitrator's Determination No 509 of 1977. It is expected that any excess Second Division staff will be redeployed in the Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to those staff employed on functions to be transferred to a State Government, it is envisaged that that State Government would make offers of employment to all such staff and that they would transfer to State employment in accordance with provisions of Part IV of the Public Service Act. Finalisation of terms and conditions of transfer and employment with the State Government will be subject to negotiations with State authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       For those staff in areas which are to be transferred to the private sector, it is envisaged that those organisations will be sold as going concerns and that offers of employment by the relevant private employers will be made to the Commonwealth staff undertaking the functions to be transferred. The terms and conditions of transfer and subsequent employment of these staff will be negotiated with the individual private employers.

       (1) to (4) This will be the largest meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government yet held and will be by far the largest meeting at this level ever to take place in Australia.

       Over the last decade the practice has developed of holding the Meeting in different member countries of the Commonwealth. Recent Meetings have been held in Singapore, Ottawa, Kingston, London and Lusaka. If smaller countries such as Singapore, Jamaica and Zambia can fulfil their obligations as Members of the Commonwealth of Nations, it is right that Australia should, too.

       Much needs to be available in the way of facilities and equipment for a meeting of this level and size. Much of the equipment being provided, whether for example in the security area or for Conference Centre furnishings, will have a future government use. Decisions on the acquisition of equipment are made with future use in mind.

       My Department's current estimate of expenditure on CHOGM is $12m. The greatest individual expenditure, about $6m, relates to security in Victoria. A substantial portion of this $6m will comprise transfer of funds from the Commonwealth to the State of Victoria to offset increased operating costs of the Victoria Police Force in providing the required security during CHOGM. Also included in the $6m for security is expenditure on security communications equipment such as portable radio transceivers and television surveillance equipment. Much of this equipment will have a Commonwealth use after the Meeting. Other major items of expenditure include residential accommodation, transport, fitting out of the Meeting venue, furniture, and the operating costs of the Task Force which has been established to handle the arrangements for the Meeting.

       (1) On 14 May 1981 the rate of interest at which funds would have been made available by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Australian Wheat Board was 11.5 per cent per annum.

       (2) The Australian Wheat Board did not draw borrowings from commercial sources on 14 May 1981. However the AWB has been provided with a representative sample of rates of interest for 14 May at which it could borrow by the issue of bank bills and promissory notes. These rates for different maturity periods would have varied from 16.2% per annum to 17.0% per annum.

      <para>
       (2) As a general program of assistance for the development of transition education programs for young people, Transition Program funding is provided to the States following Commonwealth approval of broad State 'package' proposals for schools and TAFE institutions rather than for specific areas of disadvantage such as handicapped persons. Under the Program guidelines the Commonwealth seeks to encourage education authorities in the States to take account of the needs of particular disadvantaged students, but it is for these authorities to determine priorities amongst individual proposals within the broad 'package' proposals approved by the Commonwealth. While it is not possible to identify all school projects specifically concerned with the handicapped, there have been a number of such projects funded and it is evident that the needs of the handicapped are being recognised by the responsible authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In addition to Transition Program funding, it is possible for handicapped persons attending special schools and classes to benefit from an employment point of view through the Commonwealth's Special Education Program administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission. This program aims to improve the quality and coverage of educational services for handicapped children by supplementing the funding of special schools and classes. While these funds are not specifically directed to assistance for the employment of handicapped persons, they may be used for work experience and vocational training programs conducted by special schools and regular schools in which there are special classes. Within the Commonwealth's Special Education Program there is a Children in Residential Institutions element which funds projects designed to improve the educational prospects and to broaden the general experience of children living in institutions. It is possible for such projects to be concerned with transition, work experience and vocational training.
      </para>
      <para>
       As far as programs outside the education area are concerned, the Departments of Social Security and of Employment and Youth Affairs administer programs and services designed to assist the employment of handicapped persons. Subsidies under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act and rehabilitation assistance through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are administered by the Department of Social Security. Through the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs disabled persons registered for employment may receive assistance under the National Employment and Training System to gain the skills necessary to obtain employment. Employment subsidies are provided for on-the-job training. A number of work preparation/training programs are funded and assistance for individuals to undertake formal training is available.

      <para>
       (1) Yes, following the Review of Commonwealth Functions there has been some modification of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) eligibility rules which generally will take effect as from 1 January 1982. The general intention is also that students who have already qualified under the rules which have now been modified will continue to do so. Consequently, the decision, that participation in a de facto relationship will no longer qualify an applicant for independent status, will not affect those students who have already qualified for independent status in this way. Those granted independent status on this basis prior to 1982 will retain that status.

It does not necessarily require that the applicant should be in receipt of supporting parent's benefit nor to have been involved in a de facto relationship. Students who have already qualified for this provision will continue to do so after 1981, while new applicants as from 1 January 1982 will be assessed against the ongoing requirements for independent status.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No. Students will continue to be eligible to apply for independent status if they have been employed full-time in the workforce for periods totalling two years out of the previous five. However, one of the decisions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions was that periods of registration for employment which do not involve the receipt of unemployment benefits may now be taken into account in determining the two year qualifying period for independent status, provided the student was unemployed and in Australia and available for full-time work. This relaxation of the rules will take effect as from 1 January 1982.

      <para>
       Since 1977, the State Homeless Persons Advisory Committees, which have now been abolished, commented on a wide range of issues and on various Commonwealth Government programs. It is not appropriate to respond to the question in terms of recommendations accepted, rejected or under consideration, because: (i) in addition to the 77 recorded separate recommendations from the various State Committees, some of which have been provided by more than one State Committee, an unknown number of recommendations were made orally in discussions with the former Minister and officers of the Department; (ii) in the nature of Advisory Committees, the expression of views and discussion of issues is as important as (was) the submission of formal recommendations.

      <para>
       Important issues raised by the Advisory Committees include:

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Government has given its full support to the International Year of Disabled Persons. The situation with the Public Service Board and departments generally is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The Government and the Public Service Board have a policy of equal employment opportunity in the Australian Public Service. That policy is in keeping with the Government's endorsement of 'access to all aspects of community life' as one of the themes of IYDP. The policy of equal employment opportunity applies to disabled people seeking employment, or already employed, in the Australian Public Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       Disabled people employed in the Public Service receive the same rates of pay, have the same job classifications, have the same terms and conditions of employment and have the same promotion opportunities as their non-disabled peers in comparable jobs.
      </para>
      <para>
       1981 marks the end of a decade of active involvement by the Public Service Board to ensure that disabled people have equality of opportunity in the Australian Public Service. The full list of steps taken by the Board is quite extensive. I will forward to the Honourable Member a resume of these initiatives, together with other material produced by the Public Service Board on the employment of disabled people in the Australian Public Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       As part of its commitment to the IYDP the Public Service Board is consolidating and extending its recruitment-based activities to ensure that people with disabilities continue to achieve equal access to the Service. The Board has produced special recruitment literature and posters which aim to imform disabled people that they can apply for jobs in the Public Service and expect to get 'a fair go'. Special recruitment activities, using this new literature, have been planned for 1981. The Public Service will also continue to provide work therapy opportunities for up to 200 rehabilitees in 1981 under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service's work therapy scheme. The Board's activities to promote equal access to the Public Service and the recruitment of disabled people is an integral part of its equal employment opportunity program, a program which will continue well beyond 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Public Service Board is concerned that equality of employment not be viewed solely as a matter involving recruitment and placement of disabled people. Other important facets of equal employment opportunity, in which departments have an important role to play, include induction and orientation, access and job site modification, personnel development and training and rehabilitation of disabled staff. Permanent Heads of all departments have given the Board their full and active support for the implementation of EEO for disabled staff in this and future years.
      </para>
      <para>
       To assist departments to focus on the needs of their disabled staff the Board is also conducting a series of seminars for senior managers on the employment of people with disabilities. The seminar series commenced in May and will continue on a monthly basis during 1981 and into early 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       Departments have already taken steps to improve the employment position of their disabled staff. For example, the Department of Industrial Relations is consulting with its disabled employees concerning access, modification of amenities, training and career opportunities. It is also fostering a greater consciousness amongst its staff of the problems faced by disabled people, modifying amenities to reduce difficulties for disabled employees and training staff in the supervision of disabled employees.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, which is heavily involved in IYDP through the Government's programs for the employment of disabled people in the broader community has been expending considerable effort to modify the working environment, to obtain aids and provide induction, training and developmental programs for its disabled employees.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Department of Defence a special video program has been produced showing disabled staff at work in the Department. The video promotes positive attitudes towards the employment of disabled people. The Department of Transport is also planning an education program to inform staff about the disabled, their rights as individuals and citizens and the causes and prevention of disablement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Housing and Construction, as part of its commitment to IYDP, has undertaken a survey of staff to determine the number of disabled people employed, the nature of the disability and the difficulties they face in the work environment. This survey indicated that 6.4 percent of its staff were disabled. The Department of Capital Territory is also undertaking a survey of its staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       2(a) The Public Service Board, the employing authority in the Australian Public Service, has Special Placement Officers in each of its Regional Offices to assist in the recruitment and placement of disabled people. Special Placement Officers are able to arrange modified selection tests which take into account the applicant's disability e.g. for blind applicants tests can be administered in braille or on tape, for deaf applicants an interpreter can be provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1980 the Special Placement Officers assisted 802 disabled applicants, of whom 251 were placed in employment. 20 percent of disabled applicants gained permanent jobs in the Public Service. This compares favourably with non-disabled applicants where only 15 percent were permanently appointed to comparable positions. Departments which took a substantial number of special placements during 1980 included Defence, Education, Employment and Youth Affairs, Home Affairs and Environment, Social Security and Veterans' Affairs, together with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Taxation Office. All departments accept, wherever possible, disabled new entrants referred to them by the Special Placement Officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The steps being taken by the Board to further increase the numbers of disabled people employed in the Public Service are detailed in (1) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       2(b) There is a long-standing policy of ensuring that public buildings constructed by the Commonwealth permit reasonable access by disabled people and comply with the Australian Standards relating to Design Rules for Access by the Disabled. Access for disabled people has been provided in such buildings as the Family/Children's Court building and the Public Service Board's McLachlan Offices in Canberra. The Australian Defence Force Academy will include in certain areas special facilities for the disabled. The provision of facilities for disabled people is included in the refurbishment program for the Administrative Building, occupied by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Attorney-General's.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its capacity as the central property authority, the Department of Administrative Services, in conjunction with the Department of Housing and Construction, is implementing a strategy for access modifications to Commonwealth-owned buildings. This involves a survey of over 500 buildings to identify any necessary modification work. Details on the Government's activities were provided by my colleague Mr McVeigh in answer to question 483 on 26 March 1981 (Hansard Page 1062).
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Departmental IYDP programs are being funded within their overall 1980-81 budget allocations. The Commonwealth however has provided substantial funds as part of its commitment to IYDP. They include provision of:
      </para>
      <para>
       $1m (over two financial years) for a national publicity and community information campaign.
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       (1) The Department of Social Security does not maintain as part of its regular statistical collections statistics of grants of invalid pension by electoral division. The number of invalid pensions granted in Western Australia was 3399 during 1978-79 and 2991 during 1979-80.

      <para>
       (2) There has been no change in the eligibility criteria for invalid pension since 1 January 1980. In order to qualify for an invalid pension a claimant must be permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of at least 85 percent or be permanently blind. Determination of whether this qualification is met is made in conformity with established medical criteria which take into account the degree of the claimant's impairment together with relevant facts about the applicant such as age, sex, education, lack of skills and personal disabilities. In reaching its decision, my Department is guided by the opinion of the Department of Health.

       Additionally, on a State by State basis, a system was progressively implemented over the period January to September 1980 under which medical reports prepared by Commonwealth Medical Officers are reviewed by senior medical officers in the Department of Health. This procedure was designed to ensure consistency in the application of the criteria throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, on 7 May 1981 the Minister for Health and I issued revised guidelines for use in the assessment of eligibility for invalid pension. These clarify the eligibility criteria stated above and are publicly available.

      <para>
       There are three classes of pension applicants necessitating provision of documentation by the Department of Defence in support of their applications. These classes are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Service personnel applying for retirement benefits, on other than invalidity grounds, to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Authority;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Service personnel applying for retirement benefits, on invalidity grounds, to the DFRDB Authority; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Ex-Service personnel applying for repatriation benefits to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The majority of such pension applications are those to the DFRDB Authority relating to retirements on other than invalidity grounds. During the period from 1 January 1981 to 12 May 1981 the average time between date of discharge and receipt of the necessary documents by the DFRDB Authority was:
      </para>
      <para>
       Navy-5 days
      </para>
      <para>
       Army-2 days
      </para>
      <para>
       Air Force-3 days
      </para>
      <para>
       In cases of retirement on invalidity grounds, more detailed documentation is required before the DFRDB Authority can commence its consideration of the applications. This documentation includes Service Medical Board reports and details of the Service member's skills, qualifications and experience.
      </para>
      <para>
       Generally, a longer time is required than that taken to provide documentation for retirements on other than invalidity grounds, and some delays occasionally occur due to the complexity of individual cases.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the small number of repatriation benefit applications which require documentation from the Department of Defence, the details are usually forwarded to the Department of Veterans' Affairs within two weeks. Again, where files have to be retrieved from archives or where subsequent investigations of circumstances surrounding the application are required to be carried out, the provision of all documentation may be delayed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Defence treats all requests for such supporting documentation as expeditiously as possible

       Does the statute adopted by the Australian National University pursuant to the Australian National University Amend ment Act 1979 reflect the policy and intentions of the Government in seeking a reduction of services and amenities fees for students who do not wish to have part of the fees they have paid appropriated for socio-political purposes; if not, will the Government frame further legislative amendments to ensure that its requirements are met.

       The purpose of the Student Organisations (Amenities and Services) Statute is to prescribe the amenities and services on which fees monies compulsorily collected from all students may be spent. Where the Council of the University makes compulsory fees monies available to a student organisation for the provision by that organisation of amenities or services, then it is the duty of the Council to ensure that the monies are applied only in respect of amenities and services that are not of an academic nature, that are of direct benefit to the University, and that have been declared in a University statute to be amenities or services in respect of that organisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The current provisions of the Australian National University Act enable the University to charge lower fees to students who indicate their wish not to join particular student associations, but do not require the University to do so. It has been the Government's wish for the University to act to see that students who join a particular student organisation pay a separate membership fee, the proceeds of which are to be directed towards supporting voluntary activities which are not eligible for support from the proceeds of the compulsory fee for amenities and services payable by all students. Such an arrangement would present a clear distinction between the students who choose to join an organisation and those who do not.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government, after reviewing the operation of the 1979 amendments at the Australian National University during 1980, decided to introduce further amending legislation which has now passed both Houses of Parliament. The purpose of this legislation is threefold. First, it makes income derived from the application of compulsory student fees moneys subject to the same conditions as the fees themselves. Second, where both compulsory fees moneys and other moneys are applied with the effect of producing income, that income must be apportioned according to the applications. Third, the administrative expenses of student organisations must also be apportioned, so that only activities devoted to the provision of student amenities and services can be a charge on compulsory fees moneys. With the enactment of this legislation, the Government is confident that compulsory fees moneys cannot be used by student organisations directly or indirectly for the funding of socio-political activities.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. The appropriation request for $2.5m relates to the construction associated with the installation of the GSC-39 V(1) satellite communications ground terminal (formerly designated MSC-61), at North West Cape. I informed Parliament in March 1979 that installation of this terminal had the Government's support. The terminal will be part of the Defence Satellite Communications System (DSCS III), not the Fleet Satellite Communications System (FLTSATCOM).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2), (3) and (4) There are no plans for an additional FLTSATCOM terminal to be installed at North West Cape. The station has had a FLTSATCOM receive-only terminal in operation for several years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) A contract was placed with E-System Inc. (ECI Division) of St Petersburg, Florida, USA in April 1980 for the provision of AN/WSC-3 (RAN V1) UHF transceivers and ancillary equipment. These radios will be fitted in most RAN ships and shore establishments. It should be noted that the USN's AN/WSC-3 equipment and the RAN's AN/WSC-3 (RAN V1) equipment are similar but not identical radios.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Both the AN/WSC-3 and AN/WSC-3 (RAN V1) radios are intended for use on normal line of sight tactical radio circuits. It would not be correct to say that they were developed specifically as part of the FLTSATCOM system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Some ancillary equipments have been ordered for the AN/WSC-3 (RAN V1) equipment to permit access to FLTSATCOM satellites to provide communications interoperability at sea with ships of our allies. The ground stations which control access to the communications channels on the FLTSATCOM satellites are located at Norfolk Virginia, Honolulu, Guam, Stockton California and Naples Italy. The ground terminal at North West Cape can only receive messages from FLTSATCOM satellites, not transmit them. Nor can it control them.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The FLTSATCOM system is a US system and the US places its ground stations (and mobile stations) according to its own needs. With regard to the Australian equipment, there are no plans for accessing the FLTSATCOM system other than those referred to in the answer to part 7.

When last seen by the Senior Medical Officer RAAF Darwin on 16 November 1980, the drivers were free from any symptoms of effects from the exposure. The documents requested can be tabled and I will arrange for this to be done as soon as possible. However, the names of two non-commissioned officers involved in this incident have been blanked out of these documents because a formal inquiry into this matter was not convened and the individuals were not given the protection of the Air Force Rule of Procedures 125A (B).

      <para>
       Table 1 presents the data for officers and other ranks who resigned and failed to re-engage, by service for each quarter of each year since 1976. The table does not differentiate between non-commissioned officers and other ranks as this information is not held by the Services in a readily accessible format.
      </para>
      <para>
       The division of technically and non-technically skilled personnel who have left the Services is shown at Table 2. Navy figures incorporate 990 personnel, who over the period, elected to leave the Service on free discharge. Because of Navy personnel statistical limitations these sailors cannot be readily classified into technical and non-technical categories. Army does not hold the required information in a readily available format. However, figures were extracted manually for the calendar year 1980. These figures include all forms of discharge but are considered by Army Office as being representative of the previous four years in indicating the relative loss rate of technical personnel.

      <para>
       (1) About ten representations concerning this transfer of responsibility have been received.

       (2) Some additional clerical staff have been allocated where necessary to ensure that undue delays do not occur.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is estimated that an additional 7,600 claims for supporting parent's benefit were received in Queensland during the period to 8 May 1981, and that some 6,800 sole parents were granted supporting parent's benefit during the same period solely as a result of the reduction in 'waiting period' for supporting parent's benefit as from 1 November 1980. It is not known what proportion of these people would have previously been eligible for Family Assistance Payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Although no additional social work staff have been appointed, the Department is providing a service to those in urgent need of assistance. In addition, the Department of Children's Services in Queensland is continuing to provide the family counselling services which have traditionally been the responsibility of the State Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No provisions have been made for immediate cash payments of benefits; however it is extremely rare that complaints are received regarding difficulties in cashing cheques. Arrangements have been made to telegraph money to claimants who live in remote areas where a need for urgent assistance has been indicated.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Department does not keep records on whether an individual officer or employee has been on strike or engaged in any restrictive work actions. However, it is possible to identify several groups of employees who have engaged in such activities during each of the last two years. These groups include employees at Williamstown and Garden Island Dockyards, foremen, storemen and packers, and a substantial number of officers in the Clerical grades. It is therefore possible to estimate the number of officers or employees who have been on strike or who have engaged in restrictive work action at approximately 6500.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) During the year ended 31 March 1980, 182,605 manhours were lost through strikes. During the year ended 31 March 1981, 474,459 manhours were lost through strikes. Of the latter figure 222,092 manhours were lost in one dispute, concerning the manning of the Plate Preservation Line at Williamstown Dockyard. Because of the nature of restrictive work actions it has not been possible to ascertain the number of manhours involved in them.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No officers or employees have been paid for any periods during which they have been on strike.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Most employees whose conditions of employment are governed by Public Service Arbitrator's Determination No. 44 of 1955 normally receive a naval work adjustment allowance. This allowance currentlly ranges between $3.60 and $9.40 per week. When these employees, most of whom are employed at Williamstown and Garden Island Dockyards, engage in any restrictive work practices this allowance is not paid. On occassions, management has insisted that employees perform work that is under ban or limitation. Upon refusal the pay of the individuals concerned has been stopped.

However, a breakdown by airline is not available and I am not prepared to authorise the use of resources which would be required to identify that detail. Nevertheless, it would be reasonable as an approximate guide to assume that this expenditure would be dissected in about the same proportions as shown for the rest of the Defence organisation in the table above.

        —The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. The level of funds to be made available for children's services in 1981-82 will be considered by the Government in the Budget context. However, I indicated that expenditure by this Government on children's services, other than expenditure on pre-schools, had greatly increased in real terms since 1975-76.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I assume that the 'special assistance grant' mentioned is in fact 'special needs subsidy' payable to certain services subsidised under the Children's Services Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special needs subsidy is paid to assist day care services to rebate the fees of low income families.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special needs subsidy is payable under the general provisions of the Children's Services Program for family day care, and under the provisions of the Child Care Act for centre based services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the general provisions, each family day care scheme receives Commonwealth special needs subsidy equal to the amount of fees foregone as fee rebates, up to a maximum total amount which is calculated on the basis of $7 per week for each equivalent full time child income.
      </para>
      <para>
       The current rate of $7 per week used to calculate the maximum was introduced in 1977. A scheme can apply to the Minister for increased Special Needs Subsidy payments if it finds that the maximum amount does not cover the costs of fee rebates. Such increased payments are approved at ministerial discretion after an assessment of need. These arrangements also apply to day care centres funded under the centre based day care arrangement with the State governments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Child Care Act, payments to centres are made on the basis of the numbers of certain categories of children specified in Section 12 of the Act. Since 1975, each centre has been eligible to receive 25c subsidy per hour per child three years and over, and 40c per hour per child under three years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The question of the appropriate level of unemployment benefit for people under the age of 18 is bound up with the broader question of the assistance available for them in unemployment, education and training. This has been under study in the context of the review of ways of increasing the opportunities available for young people in education, training and employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The welfare and education implications for State governments as well as possible effects on State financial responsibilities, are relevant to consideration of possible changes in this area. State governments have been consulted as part of the review and the matter has been discussed by the Council of Social Welfare Ministers.

        —The reply to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training established in 1976 under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Bruce Williams recommended, R6.25, ' . . . a considerable improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of advanced education statistics to make possible comparative studies that should guide any further decisions on rationalisation.' This was one of a number of Williams Committee recommendations referred to the Tertiary Education Commission for consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present different measures are used to calculate the number of equivalent full time students, 'student load', for the university and advanced education sectors. For universities student load is measured in terms of the weighted student unit (WSU) which is calculated by measuring the academic program for each student against the normal program for a full time student in each course. Higher degree enrolments are given special weightings. For colleges of advanced education student load is calculated by giving a weight of 1.0 to full time students and 0.5 to part time and external students.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are difficulties in accurately calculating student load in colleges of advanced education because the measures currently being used tend to overstate it. The Tertiary Education Commission, in Volume 1 Part 1 of its Report for the 1982-84 Triennium, has advised that it considers that since most part time students in advanced education, and particularly external students, undertake less than one-half of a full year's work, the real student load generated by a part time enrolment is likely to be closer to 0.4 than 0.5 of the load of a full time student. The Commission has taken this into consideration in formulating its recommendations on the advanced education sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       The development of a WSU type measure is under consideration by the Joint Committee on Advanced Education Statistics.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This answer presumes that the honourable member is referring to the Oceanographic Research Ship HMAS Cook presently under construction at Williamstown. The hydrographic survey vessel HMAS Flinders was also constructed at Williamstown; however that vessel has been in operation for the last seven years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The cost of the Oceanographic Research Ship HMAS Cook is $30.886m at December 1980 prices. The estimated project cost in September 1974, construction commencement date, was $17.5m. The total net real price increase amounts to $2.031m of the increase of $13.386m. The balance of the increase, i.e., $11.355m, has occurred due to inflationary factors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No-the design work package for this ship was completed prior to 1974. Minor design changes have been included in the shipbuilder's work package subsequent to that date; however these have not delayed the completion of the ship.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) An increase in real costs of $0.188m (approx) to implement 111 design changes. Balanced against this cost figure is a saving of $0.141m which resulted from implementation of four design changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The cause of the period of delay in completion of the ship can be attributed to the inability of the main machinery contractor to satisfactorily instal the main propulsion machinery in the ship to meet specification contract requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Reimbursement of costs associated with rectifying the machinery deficiencies, together with the shipbuilder's consequential costs resulting therefrom, e.g., additional docking, delays to other scheduled docking, dockyard services, are being actively investigated by the contractual authority; the Department of Administrative Services.

       (1) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I do not consider the time taken for the review to be excessive. The Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay was given its terms of reference on 22 July 1980. The Committee submitted to me an interim report on 31 October 1980 on the work value aspect of the reference recommending an increase in Service remuneration on grounds of work value change. This recommendation has been approved and implemented.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additionally, in December 1980, the Committee of Reference was tasked with an examination of appropriate allowances for Special Action Forces. The report on this subject was presented on 6 March 1981. Without doubt, this intervening but extremely urgent reference delayed to some extent continuance of the work required by the earlier reference.
      </para>
      <para>
       Despite these strictures on the time of the Committee, two members of which are full-time members of the Arbitration Commission a further report is expected to be forthcoming by about the end of July 1981.

       (3) The amount of $103m (initially $110m) was included in the Defence Budget estimates for 1980-81 by Department of Finance, as an Allowance to meet prospective increases in wage and salary rates of both Service and civilian personnel within Defence.
      </para>
      <para>
       The actual additional estimate for the salaries sought by Defence for 1980-81 is $91.795m to cover mainly increases flowing from national wage case decisions and work value increases so far awarded to both Service personnel and civilians.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The interim increase recommended by the Committee of Reference, which is mentioned in 2. above, was effective from 22 July 1980. This was the date terms of reference for the inquiry were given to the Committee of Reference. In the report accompanying the recommendations, the Committee of Reference stated that it should not be inferred that 22 July 1980 will be the operative date for the final work value assessment or for other recommendations made necessary by the terms of reference. That final date of effect is to be a matter for separate consideration.

       (1) No. Indeed I have noted reports that some oil companies intended to withdraw discounts, following the release of the PJT report of 31 March 1981 on petroleum product prices.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Prices determined by the PJT for the oil companies are maximum justified prices. They differ between States only to the extent of differences in State taxes or other charges levied on petroleum products.
      </para>
      <para>
       Oil companies are not obliged to charge the maximum justified prices and, where competition is keen, they might not be able to obtain the full justified price. Actual prices to resellers would reflect both the strength of competition of any State price controls that may apply.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Petroleum Products Pricing Authority will take over from the PJT the respnmsibility for monitoring prices charged by the oil companies. It will have powers as proposed in the Petroleum Products Pricing Bill which I introduced into Parliament on 27 May 1981.

      <para>
       As the Commonwealth's jurisdiction over prices is limited to the corporate sector, effective action to monitor retail petrol prices, including the margins applied by non-corporate resellers, is a matter for State Governments to consider.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) An alliance between the United States and Japan has not been announced recently. In the joint communique issued by Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki and President Ronald Reagan on 8 May, it was stated that 'the Prime Minister and the President, recognising that the alliance between Japan and the United States is built upon their shared values of democracy and liberty, reaffirmed their solidarity, friendship and mutual trust'. Although there has been debate in Japan about the interpretation of the word 'alliance' in this sentence, in particular as to whether it committed Japan to a new or altered security relationship with the United States, the Government of Japan has made it clear that its relationship with the United States remains as it has been.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The joint communique further states that 'the Prime Minister and the President reaffirmed their belief that the Japan-United States Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security is the foundation of peace and stability in the Far East and the defense of Japan. In insuring peace and stability in the region and the defense of Japan, they acknowledged the desirability of an appropriate division of roles between Japan and the United States. The Prime Minister stated that Japan, on its own initiative and in accordance with its constitution and basic defense policy, will seek to make even greater efforts for improving its defense capabilities in Japanese territories and in its surrounding sea and air space, and for further alleviating the financial burden of US forces in Japan. The President expressed his understanding of the statement by the Prime Minister.'
      </para>
      <para>
       These positions outlined in the communique do not alter our perception of Japan's defence and security policies nor of Japan's relations with the United States. The Government sees cooperation under the Japan-United States Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security as a vital part of the defence of the Asia/Pacific region, as are the separate arrangements under ANZUS. It is in Australia's interest that the defence relationship between Japan and the United States remain a harmonious one.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3), (4), (5) and (6) As suggested in answer to questions (1) and (2), no event as suggested by those questions took place which required specific consultations with Australia by any other government. In both formal and informal consultations with the United States on security issues in the Pacific area, discussion would include, as appropriate from time to time, subjects related to Japan. Similarly, established patterns of consultations with Japan on matters of common international concern include subjects such as Japan's, and our own, relations with the United States.

        —The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The proportions of total Defence expenditures spent on capital equipment over the financial years 1975-76 to 1979-80 are 8.3 per cent, 12.8 per cent, 13.2 per cent, 15.5 per cent and 16.4 per cent respectively. On 19 February 1980 the Prime Minister announced in Parliament details of a defence program which is expected to raise the proportion of expenditure on capital investment to over 25 per cent of the defence vote by 1984-85.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The acquisition of new major capital equipment is considered primarily in the context of its contribution to the development of defence force capabilities as a whole. Planning for the development of Army and Air Force capabilities will necessarily take account of concurrent development of the RAN.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) None. In any one year the major equipment component of the Defence Budget comprises financial allocations for a range of equipment approved in earlier years and for new equipment to be approved in the Budget year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Studies to assist the selection of an aircraft carrier design are continuing. Conventional submarines and small surface ships are not alternatives to the anti-submarines helicopters which will be deployed with any new carrier. The carrier is to have potential for operating short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft. The Government will consider in 1983 whether or not to acquire STOVL aircraft, in the light of aircraft costs, capabilities and other relevant factors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) See my answer (4) above. A new carrier would, as do HMAS Melbourne and other major ships of the RAN, conduct operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) I cannot comment accurately on how neighbouring states might interpret Government decisions on Australian defence force development. I should expect them to see a decision to acquire a helicopter carrier as a military matter rather than, as the question implies, a political one.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) No. Service with the aircraft carrier is not a prerequisite for advancement in the RAN.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) No. Decisions on Australian defence force development are based on Government assessments of Australian defence needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) See my answer to (4) above. No useful answer can be given to this question. The eventual cost of a new carrier will depend on the type of ship selected and the range of capabilities that it might include. The Oberon submarine is no longer in production.

      <para>
       (1) Further to the Government's announcement that consideration would be given to funding activities of single purpose colleges of advanced education where they have been amalgamated with or into larger institutions to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government by the end of 1981 (Hansard, 30 April 1981, page 1843), is it a fact that Commonwealth funding for 30 single purpose CAE's will cease as single purpose institutions from the end of 1981.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) As I explained in my Statement on Commonwealth Education Policy and Financial guidelines to the Commonwealth Education Commissions, the Government intends to reach agreement with each State concerning rationalisation measures by the end of 1981. If this cannot be done, the Commonwalth will not be prepared to continue recurrent funding for the colleges concerned after the end of 1981 and if the State Governments wish these colleges to continue as separate entities they will have to make their own separate financial provision.
      </para>

      <para>
       (3) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4), (5), (6) and (7) The Government is concerned to ensure that the funds available for higher education are used in the most efficient and effective manner. The detailed arrangements for these matters will be considered by the Government following the receipt of the reports I have asked the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission to provide by 30 June and 31 August.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Yes. An amount of $5m p.a. has been earmarked within the general recurrent grants for advanced education in the years 1982 and 1983 as additional resources for CAEs which are able to expand their effort in the technologies and business studies.

      </para>
      <para>
       (13) and (14) The Government's decision to rationalise engineering courses in Victoria is based on advice from the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission which took account of the findings of the Partridge Committee in Victoria in relation to engineering education and of a working part set up by the Victorian Post Secondary Education Commission to extend the work commenced by the Partridge Committee. I am advised that the working party considered the numerical needs for engineering education in Victoria and recommended that the engineering schools of Melbourne, Monash, RMIT, Swinburne and Footscray could, if necessary, meet all those needs. In its Volume I Report the CTEC has explained the difficulties associated with predicting long-term trends in manpower needs but concludes that in view of the large number of engineering schools in Victoria and the small size of some of them, some rationalisation is required on grounds of quality.

The Department forwarded the officer's proposal to the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office which referred it to the Department of Finance. Subsequently, the officer was informed by his Permanent Head that he considered that the proposal could not be pursued at this time. The Department of Finance was also informed of the Permanent Head's views. Accordingly, no response was required.

There is no proposal before the Government to change arrangements under which public servants, like the great majority of other employees throughout Australia, become eligible to retire, or are required to retire, on the grounds of age rather than length of service.

       I refer the honourable member to my answer to House of Representatives Question No. 903, asked on 25 March 1981 by Dr Klugman and answered in the Hansard of 29 April 1981 (page 1982). In my answer I outlined the difficulties in estimating the cost of lowering the pensionable age, and provided estimates of the cost of paying an income test free pension to men aged 60 to 64 years at November 1980 pension rates and December 1980 numbers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Similar estimates have been prepared based on the estimated number of persons, pensioners and beneficiaries at June 1981, and pension rates applicable from May 1981. The additional cost of paying an income test free pension to residentially qualified men aged 60 to 64 years is now estimated to be about $580 million in a full year. This cost is additional to the estimated $320 million annual cost of existing payments to male invalid and service pensioners and unemployment and sickness beneficiaries aged 60 to 64 years.
