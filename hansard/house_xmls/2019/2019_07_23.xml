                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Hawke government introduced legislation in 1986 to establish the first parliamentary committee to oversee Australia's intelligence services, the then Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party expressed outrage. He declared that the then Labor government's modest proposal for parliamentary oversight gave one:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously! The National Party MP Peter McGauran, who would go on to become a cabinet minister in the Howard government, called the Hawke government traitors during the same debate. Some things never change. In relation to the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019, Senator Mathias Cormann told reporters yesterday:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor Party needs to decide which side they're on. The Australian government, we are on the side of keeping Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister backed those comments. I need to make a few things clear. When Labor stands up for parliamentary oversight and scrutiny of legislation to ensure that laws operate as intended, do not result in unintended and undesirable consequences and are subject to proper safeguards, the Liberals resort to cheap smears and questioning of allegiance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary committee established by the Hawke government in 1986 is now called the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. A lot has changed since then. The Liberals have liked to say that they respect the role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. And, in fact, up until the end of last year, I think it was fair to say that the Liberals lived up to what they say they like to do, which is to respect the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on which, of course, they have a majority. There are 11 members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—five senators and six members of the House of Representatives—and six of the members of the committee are from the government. It's a government controlled committee. And consistent with that, up until the end of, really, 2018, when we got into difficulty over the assistance and access bill, this Liberal government, now in it's third term, has not openly rejected a single one of the committee's recommendations to improve national security bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When they failed to implement all of the recommendations of the committee, in relation to the assistance and access bill, in December of 2018 the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs—perhaps because of their repeated claim that they liked to respect the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—felt compelled to at least pretend on that occasion that they had fully implemented all of the committee's recommendations, and they haven't stopped pretending completely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this bill, the Minister for Home Affairs has made the claim—it's a false claim, but it's his claim—that the government has only rejected two of the committee's recommendations in relation to this bill. That's what he said in his largely misleading second reading speech given on 4 July in respect of this bill. It's regrettable that the minister has chosen to simply gloss over the very detailed work that what was done by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—detailed work that was done at the urging of the government in a great hurry—because, although this bill is claimed by the government to be modelled on an English piece of legislation, that English piece of legislation was passed in 2015. This government announced that it was going to do this legislation late last year. They finally got around to bringing legislation into the House in February. They insisted the parliamentary joint committee conduct urgent hearings and provide an urgent report, which the committee did. The committee worked hard together in its bipartisan fashion, as the committee has done for so long, to produce 19 recommendations, the 19th of which was that the bill be passed. But, regrettably, of the 18 remaining recommendations, in the first sitting fortnight of this 46th Parliament we have this Prime Minister proposing to reject 10, and possibly 11, bipartisan recommendations that relate to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't actually stop with this bill. Just to mention it, on a separate bill that we are going to be debating during this sitting fortnight, which is the sunsetting of special powers relating to terrorism offences bill, the Prime Minister is proposing to reject two bipartisan recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a wave of the hand we've had the Prime Minister and his Minister for Home Affairs breaching the compact that has existed for so many years between the coalition and Labor on national security legislation, which is based on the understanding that the recommendations of the committee are to be respected and implemented. This is no small thing that the government is doing in breaching this compact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national interest is served by this committee working to achieve bipartisan recommendations. The national interest is served by this committee working in a bipartisan fashion, because when that occurs it builds the confidence of the Australian community that the national security laws, which are being passed in this place—many of which provide extraordinary powers for our agencies and many of which permit our agencies to act in secret on our behalf—are good laws, are appropriate laws and are laws that are truly going to work in the national interest.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before continuing, I'd like to say a little bit more about the way in which the government has sought to frame this debate and the techniques that they've employed to do it. These techniques include the impugning of the motives of anyone who disagrees with them, and misleading journalists and misleading the Australian people about what the bill does, who it would apply to and why it's needed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his eulogy to Bob Hawke, delivered recently, the Prime Minister of Australia declared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we will rightly honour his many achievements for our economy, for our security, for Indigenous Australians, for our society, and Australia's place in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And as a Liberal, I'm honoured to acknowledge these achievements, as I know others would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if the Prime Minister, who lauded Hawke's many achievements for the security of Australia, had been in the parliament in 1986 would he have joined his Liberal colleagues to ask Bob Hawke whose side he was on?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Prime Minister, Bob Hawke understood the need to keep this nation safe. Labor, to this day, understands the need to keep this nation safe. Bob Hawke understood that in a democracy the job of parliament is not to act as a rubber stamp for government bills. The job of this parliament is to scrutinise legislation. The job of this parliament is to debate legislation. The job of this parliament is to improve legislation which is brought to it by the government. That understanding did not make Bob Hawke weak. It made him strong and it made Australia strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government seems to have completely lost its way in understanding what the role of this parliament is and what the role of parliamentary committees is. I hope that those on the other side, the Liberal members of the House of Representatives who are members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—one of whom, the member for Berowra, is present in the chamber right now—will understand that it's incumbent on them to back in the recommendations that they made to the parliament. And when they have agreed, in unanimous recommendations—and we have there also the chair of the committee, the member for Canning, Mr Hastie—when they have signed up to those recommendations, I am expecting to hear from them in this debate that they back in the recommendations that they made not two years ago, not one year ago, but in April of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has come in. The Minister for Home Affairs has read an extraordinarily short second reading speech. He hasn't explained why it is that the government is ignoring the recommendations of the committee. He's put forward no evidence to this parliament, let alone agreed for the matter to go back to the committee, which is what should happen. The minister has put nothing before the parliament as to why these recommendations—all 11 of them—that the government is ignoring should be ignored, disagreed with or changed to something quite different. Make no mistake, the bill that's before this parliament is a very different bill to the bill that was brought to the parliament in February and examined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. And it's not a different bill because the government has chosen to accept the recommendations of the committee; it's a different bill because the government wants to make it different, for reasons that it is choosing not to explain to this parliament and to the people of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Liberal Party, including the so-called constitutional conservatives in their ranks, appear to be unable to grasp basic principles about the functioning of this parliament and the functioning of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. You would think that the very least this incompetent Minister for Home Affairs might think he should do when coming to the parliament with a bill that is different from the bill that was brought in in February would be to deign to explain to the parliament why it's different, perhaps in an attempt to at least convince his own members—the Liberal members of the House of Representatives who are members of the parliamentary joint committee—as to why the bill, in the form in which he's bringing it to the parliament, should be supported. But instead of engaging in argument, instead of playing the proper role that a minister of the crown should be playing in this place, we see this Prime Minister and all of his ministerial colleagues resorting to the same cheap smears about patriotism and loyalty to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very long and very sorry history of accusations of treason or disloyalty being thrown about for base political purposes and worse. I have in mind authoritarian governments around the world that throw those accusations around. By going down that path, this government is aping a political technique that's been used by some of the worst regimes in history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a sorry day that this Liberal Party has come to—that they will behave in the way that they are choosing to behave on this bill. And I say to the Prime Minister: 'You, Prime Minister, need to stop it. You need to tell your ministers to stop it. You need to remember that you are governing for Australia, governing for the Australian people and not constantly looking just to score a cheap headline.' That's all we've seen from this Prime Minister since the day that he was elected Prime Minister by the Liberal Party. We've certainly seen no change from looking to score cheap political points and looking for the cheap headlines. They are seeking to say all the time, not that they are governing for Australia, not that legislation is being brought in because it is in the national interest but that the legislation presents a test for Labor. That is no way to use the processes of this parliament. This parliament is not set up to provide a test for the political opposition of Australia and it's not set up to provide a test for Labor; it's set up so that this parliament can bring into law legislation that is actually in the national interest, and that's what we expect to hear from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor was last in government, we kept Australians safe. There was not a single death due to an Islamist-inspired terrorist attack in Australia during Labor's six years in office, between 2007 and 2013. By contrast, seven Australians have lost their lives to terrorist attacks on Australian soil in the six years since the coalition came to power. If those lives had been lost under a Labor government, I have no doubt that this incompetent Minister for Home Affairs would say that the blood of those Australians was on my hands or on my colleagues' hands. Regrettably, from his conduct I have little doubt that the Prime Minister would stand behind his Minister for Home Affairs. But Labor does not engage in that damaging rhetoric. I will not engage in that sort of rhetoric now, because all of us in this parliament love Australia. All of us in this parliament want Australians to be safe and secure, all of us want to see Australians prosper and none of us want to see Australia lose its character as a confident, free and democratic country. Let's have no more talk that suggests anything other than that sentiment—the belief, the feeling of every single member of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate over this bill, and over every other national security bill that comes to be debated in this place, is not, and it never is, a debate over 'Whose side are you on?' It's a debate about how: how do we ensure that our agencies have the powers they need to keep Australians safe; how do we ensure that the powers that we are choosing to give to our agencies will not be abused or misapplied; how do we balance Australia's national security with the need to uphold the rule of law and the rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation? Labor's concerns with this bill—the form in which it was brought to the parliament by the Minister for Home Affairs on 4 July—are about how. We are concerned that this bill may be unconstitutional. The government has done nothing to address those concerns. I pause on that for a moment. In the additional comments that Labor members made in the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—and it's rare for Labor members to make additional comments; usually the reports are simply unanimous reports and there's no additional comment, unlike in many reports of committees of the Senate—was this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While we have ultimately decided to recommend that this Bill be passed (with amendments), Labor members are concerned that a number of issues have not been adequately scrutinised by this Committee in the limited time available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most fundamentally, Labor members note that the President of the Law Council of Australia, Arthur Moses SC, and Professor Helen Irving (among others) have stated that the Bill is unconstitutional on the basis that it infringes the constitutional right of abode. Neither the Department of Home Affairs nor any other government representative has sought to engage with - or has disagreed with - the arguments put forward by Mr Moses or Professor Irving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Clearly, Australians are not made safer by laws found to be unconstitutional. The Committee has sought to address the constitutional concerns that have been raised by submitters by recommending that the government obtain legal advice from the Solicitor-General (or equivalent) on the constitutional validity of the final form of the Bill. Labor members of the Committee do not believe this recommendation goes far enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for that is that this government has form for misleading the committee, for misleading the parliament and for misleading the people of Australia about the constitutionality of an earlier national security bill. We know that because the former Solicitor-General, Justin Gleeson SC, said so in a Senate committee inquiry hearing. He explained that the former Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, had misled the committee, this parliament and the public of Australia as to his own—that is, Mr Gleeson's—advice about the constitutionality of a particular piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not good enough for the government to simply assert, 'Nothing to see here' or, 'No problems here.' Cogent arguments have been put forward in public by eminent constitutional lawyers. This government owes it to the parliament to explain why this bill is in fact constitutional. Up until now, it has done nothing of the kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned that the bill as presented to parliament contains basic drafting errors. That was so in respect of the bill the committee reported on in April. The government has refused to fix those basic drafting errors. We are concerned that the government has released at least 10, and probably 11, recommendations of the Intelligence and Security Committee without any explanation, because nothing in the second reading speech—the short second reading speech—that was made to this place by the Minister for Home Affairs on 4 July goes even close to explaining why the government has rejected these recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned that the government is falsely claiming that it is rejecting only two recommendations of the committee, as if to minimise the significance of the government's breach of bipartisanship on national security. I hope we are going to hear from all three of the Liberal members of the committee who unanimously voted for the recommendations the committee made on a bipartisan basis. I hope we're going to hear from all of them. I see that the member for Berowra is next in line. No doubt he's going to be telling this parliament that he intends to cross the floor to support the amendments we have foreshadowed! I see the minister's adviser looking anxiously from the box towards the member for Berowra, perhaps worrying that he might in fact cross the floor to keep faith with the recommendations he made as a member of the committee! And he has to, because he wanted the bill to be amended in the fashion the committee set out in its report, and it'll be very disappointing if we don't hear support from the member for Berowra as to why the government has got this wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned that in an effort to avoid debate on the very considerable merits of the committee's recommendations the government has resorted to misleading journalists and the Australian people about what the bill does, who it would apply to and why it's needed. Our overriding concern is that the government is more interested in playing politics with the national security of Australia than it is in getting national security laws right. And let's be clear—I need to state it again—Labor supports the intent of this bill; we want to work with the government to get this bill right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments I'll be moving in respect of the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill and the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill will ensure that the bill conforms to the unanimous and bipartisan recommendations of the Labor and government members of the intelligence committee—no more, no less. But we don't pretend that our amendments address every concern that's been raised about this bill. For instance, it's been increasingly suggested that the use of the powers in the bill could in some circumstances actually increase the likelihood of innocent Australians being the target of terrorist attacks overseas. Clearly a suspected terrorist who has freedom of movement in a foreign country will pose a much greater danger to innocent Australians than the same person would pose to Australians from a prison cell at home. We've seen numerous examples during the time that the caliphate was ruling over Raqqa province in Syria. We've seen numerous examples of Australian nationals broadcasting messages to Australians at home, from Raqqa, in an endeavour to recruit them to the Islamist cause, to the cause of ISIL. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One could want no better example than the recruiting activities of Neil Prakash. He is an Australian who served in the forces of ISIL and who is now languishing in a Turkish jail. He is the subject of an extradition request by Australia which, I would hope, will again be activated when Mr Prakash has served the prison term that's been imposed on him by a Turkish court. We can find no better example than the activities of Mr Prakash. He has broadcast to Australians using, in particular, social media and other resources of the internet to endeavour to recruit them to carry out acts of terror here in Australia or to travel and join him in the service of Islamic State in Raqqa province. Happily, that's a regime that has now come to an end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government really needs to consider that these bills, if the provisions contained in them become law, create only a discretionary set of powers. I would be urging the government, and Labor would be urging the government, to ensure that if these powers do become part of Australian law they are used sparingly. I need hardly remind the government and this parliament that the greatest loss of Australian lives in a terrorist attack did not happen on Australian soil but in Bali. Many more Australian lives have been lost to terrorism overseas than on our shores. That's why we've had the call from our great ally the United States of America through its Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He has called on all countries of the world who have nationals in camps in Syria or detention centres that are maintained in Syria to take their nationals back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Labor accept the need for a power, in some form, to enable the management of what now appears to be a very small number of Australians who are seeking to return to Australia after having engaged in terrorist acts overseas—Australians who have fought with ISIL, Australians who have put themselves at the service of the caliphate and engaged in terrorism there. It's apparent from Mike Pompeo's words and from those of other officials of the United States government, and from officials of the Kurdish regime, that they want countries to take their nationals back. They are concerned about the impact of those people who have been engaged in terrorism and continue to be at large posing a threat not only to Australians overseas but also, potentially, still, to Australians here in Australia—and to all peoples of the world—if they are not brought under control, if they are not brought back and charged with the criminal offences that, under our law, they committed in Raqqa, in the service of the caliphate. That's primarily what ought to happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, regrettably, the government's bill does not even require the minister to turn his mind to the risks posed to innocent Australians overseas. That's one of the reasons why we are asking for this bill to be referred back to the intelligence and security committee for further scrutiny. It's one of the reasons the Prime Minister should agree to this request, that the bill be referred back to the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is focused on working towards a bill that will withstand constitutional challenge, a bill that is subject to appropriate safeguards and oversight and a bill that does what it intends to do—that is, keep Australians safe. We ask the government to abandon the cheap politics, to start acting like a government that governs in the national interest and to join us in this endeavour.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I'm speaking in favour of the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 and associated bill, as presented by the minister and against the amendment that was presented to us by the member for Isaacs. As the member for Isaacs pointed out, I do serve on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and he is right: it is a very important committee of the parliament. But what makes it a very important committee of the parliament is the subject matter that it deals with. It deals with national security. It deals with highly sensitive issues. The committee gets top secret briefings. It holds its hearings in camera as well as in public, and we seek, as every committee in this parliament does, to analyse and scrutinise bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken on many occasions in favour of the good work that the committee does. But the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is, like every other parliamentary committee in this place, a committee. It is subordinate to this parliament. It can make recommendations that can be accepted in toto, accepted in part or rejected. I've sat on plenty of committees where reports have come up and they've been accepted in part, as is the case with this particular set of legislation; on other committees where reports have been rejected and on other committees where they've been accepted in toto. I've seen Labor members sit on committees which have had recommendations accepted in part, and they have subsequently voted for the legislation. The committee discharged its function here by examining the bill. It was a matter for the government to determine what it wanted to put before this House, and the government determined the matters it wanted to put before the House. I support the bill as presented by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make some broad comments in relation to the bill. In September 2014, Australia's national terrorism threat level was raised for the first time since 2002. This public alert system has since sat at high, denoting that a terrorist attack is likely. The threat of terrorism in this country is clear and tangible. Over the five years that have followed, our security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have disrupted 16 attempted terrorist attacks in this country. The most recent was on 3 July when three men were arrested in Sydney over their planned hostilities in connection with ISIL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the one hand, this is a figure to be applauded. It's the product of thousands of dedicated officers, agents and intelligence experts working around the clock to keep Australians safe. It's the product of a more than $3 billion increase in security funding that our government has secured since 2014. This year we've provided the AFP with an additional $512 million for counterterrorism and combatting transnational crime. On the other hand, this figure is deeply alarming. The indiscriminate threat of terrorism creates fear. Protecting all Australians from people who seek to harm us must be, and indeed is, our government's most critical task. These bills are essential to achieving this. They are time-critical additions to our existing matrix of national security laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2012, we have seen close to 230 Australian citizens travel to Syria and Iraq to engage directly with and assist extremist organisations. Approximately 80 of these citizens are still active in conflict zones. Many of the fighters have taken their families, partners and children with them, and they've been given a chance to learn, as the Minister for Home Affairs has put it, the art of terrorism. They have been given the chance to undertake violent offences against Australian troops. They've been given the chance to support the extremist groups with resources and knowledge. They've been given the chance to learn how to construct improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Now, with the collapse of Islamic State's territorial control, these people are in a position where they want to return home to Australia. Media reports suggest that many have returned home and others will be seeking to return home in the near future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although many of these people are of counterterrorism interest, under article 12.4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it is their right, as Australian citizens, to return to Australia. The proposed TEO scheme doesn't arbitrarily deprive these people of the right to abode. Instead, it necessarily gives the government an effective means to monitor and regulate the return of these fighters, keeping the protection of our Australian community a paramount consideration. These changes are sensible and deserving of bipartisan support. Likewise, the scheme's orders are subject to reviewing authorities. In accordance with international covenants which Australia has ratified, it also has specific provisions which consider the best interests of children directly or indirectly implicated in these extremist activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since it was introduced in the last parliament on 21 February, the TEO scheme has been amended to include some of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. As a member of that committee, let me state again, as the chair has done, that I too am satisfied with the government's response to that report. The government is not bound to accept all the recommendations of the PJCIS, as it is not bound to accept the recommendations of any committee. As my colleague, the member for Canning has stated, the most significant compromise is over judicial review. The government has accepted that and, on that basis, I think we can move forward as a parliament and pass the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A temporary exclusion order allows the Minister for Home Affairs to delay the entry of an Australian citizen of heightened terrorism risk for up to two years without a return permit. Consistent with division 104 of the Criminal Code, the person must be at least 14 years of age. This ministerial discretion is not unfettered. The minister may issue a TEO if our Australian security agencies have assessed the person as a direct or indirect risk for reasons relating to politically motivated violence and have advised the minister therein or if the minister suspects on reasonable ground that a TEO would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist attack, preventing a person from being trained by a terrorist organisation and/or preventing a person from assisting a terrorist attack or terrorist organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mutually exclusive nature of these two circumstances is crucial. Fighters are seeking to return home from overseas conflict zones. These threats are in a constant state of flux. The highly nuanced case-specific challenges posed, and the relay of information between Australia's security agencies and the Department of Home Affairs, is such that the minister must act urgently as soon as a threat becomes apparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reviewing authorities provide a safeguard for the exercise of the minister's powers. Under the scheme, TEOs don't come into force until a reviewing authority has assessed the legality—as opposed to the merits—of the minister's decision to issue the order. This authority, being a retired judge or a senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, is independent, providing additional accountability in the scheme. Judicial review will also be available through the Federal Court or the High Court of Australia. If the reviewing authority determines the minister's decision to be unlawful, the TEO will be taken never to have been made. The authority will have access to all information that is in the public interest. However, if insufficient information is provided, it remains open to the reviewing authority to potentially overturn the TEO. This enables the independent authority to reach a well-informed decision while still protecting the sensitivity of Australia's information sources and defence capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conversely, the scheme also confers power on the minister to issue a TEO that can come into force immediately. This is vital for situations such as when the return of a high-risk individual is imminent and the minister has just been made aware of that fact. Temporarily delaying return is justified by the urgency of such cases. It is important to note that this decision is still subject to the ordinary reviewing authority process. The TEO can still be struck down at any hour—a day or a week later, for example. However, this simply adds an additional temporary layer of security—a proactive rather than reactive way of mitigating risk in the interim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the greatest tragedies of the Australians who have fought or assisted terrorist groups in Iraq is that some took their families with them or had children while in the service of ISIL. We know that children are vulnerable. By immersing children in ISIL conflict zones, they too may have been given the chance to learn the art of terrorism. They may, as well, bear an increased risk of harbouring radical thoughts. These are the same children who, on application, will return to Australia. Without adequate monitoring, they may put the lives of other Australian children at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is appropriate to balance this concern with the best interests of each child. The TEO scheme reflects this. TEOs cannot apply to a person under the age of 14. If the person is aged between 14 and 17, the minister must regard both the protection of the community and the best interests of the child. But the protection of the community is paramount. Section 10(4) includes additional safeguards. It provides that the age, maturity, culture, lifestyle and physical and mental health of a 14- to 17-year-old, as well as the benefit of them meaningfully connecting with their family, their right to education and their right to practise their religion, among other factors, must be taken into account by the minister when issuing a TEO. This is an effective, sensible balance between a child's vulnerability, Australia's international obligations and vital community protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the scheme, to enter Australia while the TEO is in force would be a criminal offence punishable by up to two years imprisonment. Facilitating the entry into Australia of a person who has a TEO issued against them may also incur the same penalty. This second offence requires the owner or operator of a vessel or aircraft to have actual knowledge that the individual is subject to a TEO that prohibits them from returning to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both these new offences are essential components of the TEO scheme's enforceability. They acknowledge that those returning from their suspended extremist engagements in Syria and Iraq will be subject to the full force of Australian law, should they be in a position to return to this country. These provisions aid in ensuring TEOs are complied with, delaying the passage of foreign fighters so that Australian security agencies have time to conduct their investigations and appropriate conditions can be implemented to keep other Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TEO scheme stands in contrast to control orders. A control order is issued by the courts with the consent of the Minister for Home Affairs. It enables the liberty of an individual to be restricted if it substantially helps prevent terrorist attack, or if the individual is trained in, engaged in or convicted of terrorism. The individual can, for example, be prevented from leaving Australia, being in certain areas, communicating with certain people, owning certain items, accessing forms of technology and carrying out certain activities, and they may be required to wear a tracking device.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TEO scheme has a starkly different function. Its aim is the regulation of these persons of counterterrorism interest that are Australian citizens seeking to return to the country. In areas of active conflict, to compile sufficient evidence for criminal prosecution can be difficult, so most of these individuals have not yet been convicted and are still subject to further investigation and assessment. To reflect this, the second part of the TEO scheme provides for the issuance of return permits and attached conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A return permit must be issued on the application of an Australian citizen to the minister, or where the Australian citizen has been deported or extradited to Australia. The minister has discretion to issue a return permit if he or she otherwise considers it appropriate to do so under section 15(2). For example, if there was a natural disaster in Iraq or Syria and the fighter was unable to submit an application, the minister may find it appropriate to issue a return permit so as to evacuate the person to safety. This discretion favourably allows the unique circumstances of each case to be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar to a statement of claim, a return permit must be served personally on the person to whom the order relates, or a parent or guardian if the person is between 14 and 17 years old. However, recognising the irrationality of personal service in an active conflict zone, the minister must only comply with the personal service requirement where it's reasonably practical to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Return permits have two main strengths. First, much like division 3 of the Bail Act 2013, section 16 of the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 provides for an exhaustive list of conditions that can be attached to return permits. Pre-entry and post-entry conditions are available. Second, a return permit may specify a certain time frame in which a person must return to Australia, delaying their passage by a time reasonably necessary to assess the risk posed by their entry. This delay, however, cannot be for more than 12 months, so, whether a return permit or temporary exclusion order is in force, our communities will remain protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, section 16(8) necessitates that the minister must consider whether the person has a lawful right to remain in the country and whether they are at risk of detention, mistreatment or harm before preventing a person from entering Australia. Post-entry conditions include notifying authorities of certain activities, associations and education. This balances the presumption of innocence and terrorism risk management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the TEO scheme, it's an offence to provide false or misleading information with regard to return permits. The defendant, the foreign fighter, bears the evidentiary burden of proving that the material they provided was not false or misleading. This promotes accountability and favourably reduces public expenditure. The financial impact of this scheme is low, and costs will be met from within existing agency allocations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, the TEO scheme addresses the vexed issue of what to do with Australian citizens who have been exposed to terrorism in Syria and Iraq, either by directly participating in terrorism or by virtue of being family members of terrorists. These bills strike the balance of upholding Australia's international obligations while protecting Australian communities from those who've lived and supported organisations whose entire ideology is the destruction of the West and the Australian values we hold dear. Many of these people have been reprogrammed to oppose our way of life, so, although they have a right to return to their country of citizenship, it's crucial to have regulations in place to monitor their return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are commonsense reforms to Australia's national security framework. They allow the minister, under appropriate supervision, to delay the re-entry of foreign fighters and their families who are potentially experienced in committing terrorism. They also put in place structures to closely monitor and investigate their individual profiles to allay risk once they return home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend these bills, as presented by the minister to this House, and I oppose the amendments that have been put forward by the member for Isaacs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 and related bill and to add a bit more nuance to the discussion we're having here today by drawing on my experience and knowledge in this area. As the member for Isaacs and shadow Attorney-General pointed out—and I'd like to reiterate this quite strongly—Labor puts the safety and security of Australians first. We do support strong laws. We seek to work in a very bipartisan manner to ensure national security. We have worked for the most part in a very bipartisan manner with the government on these issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern, and the concern of Labor, is that the current legislation is not strong, effective and impactful. The other concern, which the member for Isaacs spoke about at length, is the process for these bills. The issues raised point to the fact that, in essence, if the government were to pass these bills in their current form it would in actuality be rejecting the recommendations of its own committee. The PJCIS is run by the government, is chaired by the government and has majority government members. That has historically and traditionally worked quite well in a bipartisan manner with Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to speak about the broader context of foreign fighters, violent jihadists and the situation we currently have. I'd like to make some points here. This temporary exclusion orders legislation before us gives some precedence and thought to mitigating the very immediate threat violent jihadists, who may or may not have participated in violent warfare, returning to Australia pose to Australia because they retain a particular ideology that may then fuel further violent operations. The member for Berowra spoke at length about people gaining experience in terrorism. I can tell the member for Berowra that there are people with no experience in terrorism who can cause just as much destruction as those with experience in terrorism. That, unfortunately, is the nature of modern terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, community safety and mitigating the very immediate threat of returning foreign fighters or returning violent jihadists should be of the utmost importance. There are three points I'd like to make about where the legislation falls short. Australia currently has one of the broadest suites of legislation around terrorism and terrorism related incidences of any Western country. That doesn't necessarily mean that we have a more effective and more impactful legislative suite when it comes to terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here perpetuates the mistake that we made in believing that al-Qaeda, ISIS and the violent jihadi ideology could be eradicated through traditional military means alone—through the decimation of terrorist capabilities, through the decimation of terrorist training camps and through limiting their financial capacity. What we've seen and experienced is that that is certainly not the case. This is a war for hearts and minds as much as it is a battle on the battlefield.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make some points about the TEOs and why we should not only be concerned about immediate community safety but also have medium- and long-term strategies to fight terrorism and eradicate terrorism. The first point I'd like to make on that is that a significant proportion of foreign fighters have a migratory nature. That means that they will go from one theatre of war to the next theatre of war. Foreign fighters in Syria, for example, had been trained in the battles in Afghanistan years before. When we apply these temporary exclusion orders and we keep people out of Australia for two years with the priority, and the correct priority, of keeping Australians safe and mitigating that initial threat, we also need to recognise that what we're doing is keeping them away so that they then become migrant foreign fighters chasing the next theatre of jihad. And unless we do everything that we can to eradicate the threat of terrorism at its roots, unless we do everything that we can to battle violent jihadism in all its forms, there will be another theatre of jihad. There will be another war, another combat space, and these people will simply move to that next theatre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make, which again underscores the need for not just having TEOs to mitigate immediate threats but also having a medium-term vision for eradicating and dealing with terrorism, is about restitution and justice. I recently read the atrocious story of a Yazidi woman, who was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, she is not alone, and the kinds of atrocities that were committed against Yazidi women by ISIS fighters show unimaginable barbarity. I think that it is important that these women, and men and children, have some form of justice, some form of restitution. How can we do that if we don't bring these people to justice? Whether it's by bringing them back here and sending them through courts or having some other form of international, coordinated effort where we can at least have some form of restitution for the horror and the suffering that the Yazidi women, the Yazidi people and other minorities in Syria and Iraq went through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point that I'd like to make is that Australia is not alone in this situation. There were many countries who had a higher proportion of foreign fighters present in Iraq and Syria fighting for ISIS. We are certainly not alone. This is not an Australian dilemma and it is not unique to Australia, which points to the need for international coordination to deal with the issue of foreign fighters from all countries around the world who are seeking to return to their countries of origin. I must reiterate this point very strongly, because in 2015 I went to United Nations talks in Vienna and it was very clear there that we needed much more international coordination, and much more of an international effort, on how we deal with returning foreign fighters and how we also deal with the issue of terrorism more broadly as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, we support the intent of these temporary exclusion orders. We support the intent of these orders in that they give priority to keeping Australians safe and they give priority to community safety. However, the process at which we are now at, this point where we are debating this legislation here in parliament, has raised some issues of significant concern for Labor. Those issues of concern being that the recommendations made by the government's own committee, the PJCIS, have basically been ignored. When we vote on this legislation, what we are going to have is a government that is voting against its own recommendations. We're also going to have an issue where a longstanding record and history of bipartisan on national security issues—particularly through the PJCIS, as the committee with a mandate in this area—appears to have been undermined and eroded by the government's actions with regard to this legislation. It certainly sets a precedent that I think is not in the interests of all Australians and certainly not in the interests of the safety of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, I believe that the TEO is absolutely necessary to ensure immediate community safety. But as with all legislation, it cannot be effective if it is not backed up by a much more robust and comprehensive approach to countering the threat of terrorism in Australia. That process, that agenda or that suite that we have cannot purely be legislative. I note that the member for Berowra in his speech recently, just here, talked about children who have been taken to Syria and Iraq in ISIS combat zones. They may well have been raised into a radical ideology, and they would be coming here—if we allowed them in—and would not be monitored. Yes, he's absolutely right. That's because this government has failed to develop any kind of effective program of early prevention, of deradicalisation—to use the term quite loosely, as an umbrella term—and of social reintegration, particularly for children and young people who have fallen prey to radical ideologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have talked a big game on this. They have talked a big game about providing $13 million for deradicalisation programs. They have talked a big game about $60 million for eradicating the threat of terrorism. The fact is, as I know and as people who I have worked with in the past know, there is nothing there on the ground. We have 13-year-olds who are becoming radicalised. Their parents are crying out for programs and support, but there's nothing available for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we can keep an eye on legislation and temporary exclusion orders—to keep people out, mitigate that risk and all of that—this is not a problem that's going to go away after two years. We can keep them out for two years; but, after two years, we're going to have the same problem. There may perhaps even be a greater problem if a new theatre of jihad arises somewhere and they all migrate to that new theatre of jihad or if they end up staying where they are and become more radicalised, have more children and raise more children in a radicalised setting. This is not a problem that is going to go away with these TEOs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge us all, everyone in this House, if we are serious about the safety and security of all Australians and if we are serious about national security, to look beyond these temporary exclusion orders. We have to look beyond short-term legislative responses to long-term ideological existential threats.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 and the related bill. Before we get to the substance of the bills, I would like to provide some responses to the contribution from the member from Isaacs. Everyone in this place knows that the member for Isaacs is great at verbal gymnastics. He is incredibly good with the verbal uppercut and good with the velvet glove and sucker punch. I think the comments that he made in regard to the member for Berowra and the member for Canning were inappropriate. In my view, those two individuals are people for whom integrity runs from their pores. They should in no way be disparaged in this place for their role on a committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to the member for Isaacs that we all know where your skill set is. In particular, if we look at the member for Canning—a former SAS officer, who literally put his life on the line for this country—I think it's wrong for anyone in this place to suggest that of someone who has lived their adult life by words like honour and integrity and who has actually worked for this nation, and yet still we still hear the same comments from those opposite. I've been called lots of things, but a constitutional conservative is not one of them. However, it was suggested by the member for Isaacs that we may well be constitutional conservatives, and, as a broken-down electrician, I've got to tell you that I'm really not that sure. However, Labor is hanging its hat on the fact that not all of the recommendations of a particular committee have been applied. Every single member in this parliament—apart from the new ones, of course—has been on a committee where the recommendations of their committee work have not all been accepted by the minister or by the government of the day. It is a regular and ongoing occurrence. It happens all of the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly important bill, and, once again, I would certainly go and put on the record my congratulations and thanks to the people of our security forces—those who are out working with the AFP and those who are in law and order—who are ensuring that our nation maintains its safe record. They work very hard every single day. Those results do not happen by accident. I think we all have a debt of gratitude to those individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill does introduce a single explicit source of legislative power for the government to control the return of Australian citizens of counterterrorism interest from overseas conflict zones, and I know this is a concern for the people in my electorate. The temporary exclusion orders scheme will enable greater control over the return of these Australians by providing a streamlined mechanism to impose conditions, specifically notification requirements, and facilitate the monitoring of individuals who may pose a threat to the Australian community. Why is it necessary? Unfortunately, we no longer live in the same world that we knew. We simply do not. Since 2012, around 230 Australians have travelled to Syria or Iraq to fight with, or support groups, involved in the conflict. I don't understand that. The people I represent don't understand it. I don't know why they've done it. Certainly, we do not support it. It is just incredible to me that people would take that position, but these Australians are part of a group of over 40,000 foreign fighters, including around 7½ thousand from Western countries, who have travelled to that region since the conflict began. Around 100 Australians or former Australians who travelled to Syria or Iraq have been assessed as being deceased. So around 80 Australian men and women are currently in Syria and Iraq and have fought for, or otherwise supported, Islamic extremist groups. And, based on the data from third-party sources, there are known to be at least 20 adult women and at least 43 children in Syrian IDP camps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme comprises two components. The first prohibits the return of Australians of counterterrorism interest without forewarning. The minister will have the power to make a TEO in relation to a person which will prohibit the person's return to Australia until issued a return permit. Importantly, the bill does not permanently prohibit entry into Australia, and a person is entitled to be issued a return permit if they apply. This will prevent Australians of counterterrorism interest returning without warning or without adequate protections being in place. The second component will enable the minister to impose conditions in a return permit to control when and how the individual can return to Australia. These conditions ensure that the person will arrive into the hands of authorities with no surprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are many on this side of the House wishing to make a contribution, so I will keep my contribution brief, but we must continue to ensure that the parliament moves with the remainder of the world, and the world has shifted. It is no longer the world and the nation that we knew as children. We must take action. This is what has been recommended particularly by our own security forces, by those individuals who work every single day in this theatre. We should take their advice; and we need to act. I absolutely support these bills and what they will do for our nation to ensure into the future that we do everything we can as a parliament, as a community and as an organisation to keep Australians and our nation safe. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  It's only Tuesday, and it's already been a disappointing week for this parliament. The second day of the second week of the current parliament has put a spotlight on the threadbare agenda of this tired, third-term government. It's a government that has turned a permanent campaign into a permanent opposition. This week has revealed a government with no substantive agenda of its own and a compensating obsession with those sitting opposite to them in this chamber. It's a government that's more interested in pursuing tactical wedge politics than in delivering for those people who elected them to represent them. It's a government willing to trash longstanding norms of practice and procedure in this place in pursuit of short-term political tactics. Ultimately it is the Australian people who will pay the price for the approach being taken by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party will always work in a constructive and bipartisan manner on national security, even when we are lacking a partner in this effort. Keeping Australians safe is Labor's No. 1 priority. We support strong laws and we'll seek to work in a bipartisan way to achieve the best outcomes for keeping Australia and Australians safe. For the past six years we have worked constructively and in a bipartisan way with the government through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Throughout both the Abbott and the Turnbull governments, the PJCIS process was respected by all those who participated in it, and during that period the PJCIS inquiries resulted in 31 reports with 369 recommendations—invaluable, bipartisan work done behind the scenes in the public interest by parliamentarians acting in good faith to improve proposals and legislation brought to the committee to keep Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott and Turnbull governments accepted all but one of the committee's recommendations, and the result: better legislation to keep Australians safe. It's been hard work in this committee. I haven't been a member, but I know the regard in which it is held by all members in this chamber. A spot on this committee is keenly sought by members because we understand the privilege that it is to serve on it and the special obligations that it brings—scrutinising proposals to keep Australia safe, long hearings to gather evidence about the efficacy of these proposals, rigorously testing legislation to ensure that it delivers on those proposals, and tough, good-faith negotiations where, after this scrutiny, after hearing the evidence, there are differences of view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 and the related bill. Labor supports the PJCIS's recent recommendations on the temporary exclusion orders—bipartisan recommendations made in good faith by this committee. Labor supports strong laws that will secure the safety of Australians and we support the need for a temporary exclusion order regime. The issue of foreign fighters is not a new one, and there are international lessons that we can draw from. The United Kingdom has had temporary exclusion order legislation in place since 2015. Both Labor and Liberal members of the PJCIS worked diligently through the various community concerns and provided their detailed report on 4 April 2019, making 18 substantive recommendations. So far, so normal. That's the way it's supposed to work—a substantive report provided in good faith, a consensus report on a bipartisan basis. But this is where things change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The temporary exclusion orders legislation we are debating today explicitly rejects a number of PJCIS recommendations—for the first time explicitly rejecting consensus, bipartisan recommendations designed to improve this legislation and to make Australians safer. The government claims that it is only rejecting two recommendations, but that's clearly not true. In total, four PJCIS recommendations have been rejected in full by the Minister for Home Affairs, and six have been rejected in part. Recommendation 10 from the PJCIS suggests that a person may seek judicial review of a decision of the minister to grant or refuse an application. The government has argued that judicial reviews are unnecessary in these circumstances because a minister must accept an application for a return permit. But that's not true. The minister must give a return permit if the person has applied to the minister in a prescribed form and manner or if the person is to be, or is being, deported to Australia. The minister may refuse to give a return permit if he does not believe the person has applied in an appropriate manner. But, more importantly, judicial review of a decision to grant a return permit is needed because it allows the applicant to seek judicial review on one or more of the conditions set out in the permit rather than in the permit itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill put forward by the government is not as strong as this law should be. In fact it's unclear if the law is even constitutional. We often get lectures from those opposite about the virtues of constitutional conservatism, about not playing with a system that is working efficiently. And yet those opposite cannot, with hand on heart, stand in this chamber and say that this legislation will be constitutional. The Law Council of Australia has stated publicly that this legislation risks being struck down in the High Court for being unconstitutional. Labor members of the PJCIS have repeatedly requested an assurance from the government that the bill is constitutional, but this has been ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In rejecting the PJCIS's recommendations, the Minister for Home Affairs seems to have forgotten that these are not partisan recommendations, that these are not recommendations of the Labor Party. These are bipartisan recommendations from the most respected committee in this parliament, from members respected by all in this parliament, and the committee that has done invaluable work, over the past six years in particular, in making Australians safer. Unfortunately, the Morrison government is establishing a track record of breaking this compact in the way that the PJCIS has happened to date, as occurred—not explicitly, but in practice—in the last piece of national security legislation that was rushed through this parliament, the assistance and access bill, in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the PJCIS handing down 17 substantive recommendations on the assistance and access bill, these recommendations were not fully incorporated in the legislation passed by this parliament. Labor proposed several amendments to bring the legislation in line with the PJCIS's recommendations that addressed numerous community concerns that the PJCIS had heard during an extensive parliamentary inquiry into that bill. The government has in effect rejected those amendments, thereby rejecting the bipartisan compact in the PJCIS. This is no way to deal with important national security legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rushing legislation through this parliament without proper debate, eschewing established bipartisan parliamentary processes, risks problems in the future. It leads to mistakes, as we saw with the rushed passage of the access and assistance bill. Even though that bill was intended to assist law enforcement and our national security agencies by facilitating the interception of online communication channels, in practice that legislation may end up leaving Australian law enforcement and national security agencies unable to take advantage of the recently passed CLOUD Act in the United States, a US law intended to make it easier to obtain access to data held by tech companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're talking about here is the difference between data in transit and data at rest. The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill dealt with assisting law enforcement to access data that was being communicated between people. That was the whole encryption debate. But in the process of dealing with that, by failing to include judicial review in the access and assistance bill, unintentionally—because that bill was rushed through this parliament—we have precluded ourselves from having access to a new regime designed to facilitate access to a vastly large trove of data, a vastly more valuable law enforcement tool. We have precluded access to the data stored by these communications companies in the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a Law Council submission to the PJCIS inquiry in 2018, they argued that the law is likely to disqualify Australia from entering into an executive agreement with the US under the CLOUD Act, because the CLOUD Act states that before entering an agreement the US Attorney-General is required to certify that the other nation 'affords robust, substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties' in light of the data collection and activities of the foreign government that is subject to the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this is about is that the Americans have a law saying that data stored in the US is not allowed to be shared outside the US outside of this CLOUD Act regime. The CLOUD Act regime says that that data can only be shared outside the US if it's being shared with another country that has robust procedural protections for that data. The United Kingdom is currently negotiating access to that legislation, as you would expect, as a Five Eyes partner. You would expect that Australia would be next in line, as another Five Eyes partner. But we've stuffed it up. Until we fix the access and assistance bill that was rushed through this parliament—heedless of this concern—we will not be able to negotiate one of these CLOUD Act agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the cost of trashing process and procedure to ram through bills in this parliament. That is the cost of trashing the good faith bipartisan scrutiny of national security legislation in this parliament. In the bill before the House today, we must heed the lessons of the access and assistance bill. If the government passes this proposed temporary exclusion order legislation unamended, it may be unconstitutional, as we discussed earlier. If the government passes these proposed bills without change, it will do so in the face of criticism from security experts, from respected organisations such as ASPI and the Lowy Institute. There are serious consequences to disregarding established bipartisan processes and recommendations, which the Morrison government and his Minister for Home Affairs seem determined to do in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why the rush? After doing nothing for such a long period of time, why the rush now? The government wants to rush this bill through the parliament despite significant flaws identified on a bipartisan basis through the PJCIS, because it claims the legislation is urgent due to the risk of foreign fighters. This risk is not new. It has been apparent for many years that Australians would face the risk that radicalised Australians would attempt to return home. We knew this when the United Kingdom parliament passed temporary exclusion orders legislation more than four years ago. But the minister responsible for national security in this country has either been incompetent, lazy or asleep at the wheel. Why has it taken four years?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't until 22 November 2018, when the newly minted Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs, desperate for a policy announcement, realised they could announce a new temporary exclusion orders regime. But then again nothing happened. This seemingly urgent piece of legislation was then not introduced into the parliament until 21 February 2019, the second-last sitting week before the federal election. The government then rushed the legislation through the PJCIS. Both Labor and Liberal members worked extraordinarily hard through the PJCIS to make 18 recommendations, which the government rejected the majority of—10 of those recommendations. Now they want to rush this legislation that is so important to ensuring the safety of Australians through the parliament, disregarding established bipartisan practice, despite not doing anything about the issue from many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government ought to do at this point is take a deep breath, step back and restore bipartisanship in this process. It should refer this legislation back to the PJCIS. While Labor supports the need for temporary exclusion order legislation, we will seek to amend this legislation to reflect the considered thinking, hard work and bipartisan recommendations of the PJCIS. The Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill and the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill, read together, are not consistent with the PJCIS recommendations. The bills should be referred back to the PJCIS to ensure that they work, to ensure that all concerns have been addressed and to ensure that they can withstand High Court challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's high time that the Morrison government return to the bipartisan process respected by both the Abbott and Turnbull governments and let the PJCIS do its job. The safety of all Australians is too important for national security to be politicised in this way. That's the nub of it. That's what's going on here. Four years of inaction—nothing! Legislation that could have been introduced any time through that period was introduced in the second-last week before a federal election—no rush, no urgency—and now, with a new parliament that has no policy agenda and the government sniffing a short-term tactical benefit, a short-term political wedge, it is the No. 1 priority. In pursuit of that short-term political benefit, that political wedge, this government is willing to trash one of the most important institutions in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Institutions take decades to build. The respect of the PJCIS by all members of this parliament is extraordinary. It's unique in this parliament. What is happening today with this bill is very significant, and conservatives sitting opposite ought to care about this more than anyone else. Who is standing up for institutions in our democracy today? Do those opposite think that our democratic institutions are in robust health today? Do they think that their constituents, the Australians who put them in this place, think our democratic institutions are in rude health? We know that's not the case. Now is the time to take a stand for our institutions and defend them, because they pay dividends down the line.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  The Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 is very important and significant legislation because its purpose is to protect the Australian people from terrorists and returning foreign fighters who seek to harm us. Those returning foreign fighters have been radicalised online, recruited by Islamic State and their affiliates. They betrayed their country—they betrayed us—to fight in Iraq and Syria and now are seeking to return and continue the struggle. They are returning to us with combat experience, hard hearts and a proven capacity for violence and bloodshed. We have Australians among us, and looking to return, who see themselves as part of a global insurgency against free peoples committed to liberal democracy, the rule of law, and values and institutions that uphold the dignity and sanctity of the individual. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These foreign fighters have betrayed our country and exchanged their place in our community for a seat at the table of violence, bloodshed and tyranny. They do not deserve—nor should they receive—an open door back into the safety and security of our Commonwealth. Therefore, the purpose of the temporary exclusion orders bill is to delay, control and risk-manage the return of foreign fighters and other nefarious characters into our Commonwealth. Our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have a number of operational tools at their disposal, and this bill strengthens their capacity to manage the threat posed by foreign fighters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair of the PJCIS I led an inquiry into and reported on this bill in the 45th Parliament, back in April. We made 18 recommendations, including an additional one that the bill be passed. Our inquiry was thorough and our debate internal to the committee was robust, as it should be in a functioning democracy. The government has responded and accepted either fully, in part or in principle, as is the language used in the government's response, 16 of the recommendations. The government has noted two of the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this report was tabled, I have received further briefings from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, alongside my deputy chair, the member for Holt, and the intelligence we received was not encouraging, to be frank. It is true that the global coalition against Islamic State has prevailed militarily in Iraq and Syria. However, to proclaim victory is to call a false dawn. We have struck the shepherd but the sheep are scattering across the globe—and, sadly, many are Australians. We have a long fight ahead of us against Islamic State, which includes disruption, enforcement and counter-radicalisation. To buy us time, the temporary exclusions orders bill is the most effective way of allowing our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to manage the flow of foreign fighters back to Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been made clear to us that there is an operational imperative to pass this bill. I am satisfied with the government's response. Therefore, I support this bill in its present form and will vote against Labor's amendments. I think the most significant recommendation was No. 7, the judicial review. During the inquiry, we had several submitters, including the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Law Council of Australia, make it very clear that judicial oversight was lacking from the bill. We have recommended that be included. The government has responded by accepting, in principle, recommendation No. 7. That is the news story that so far has been missed by much of our media. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Isaacs spoke earlier and gave us 30 minutes of what I can only call Shakespearean obloquy. We had outrage, condemnation, self-justification and all manner of rhetorical tricks. The question for the member for Isaacs is: will you vote for this bill? He's asked coalition members if we will cross the floor to vote for the amendments. The answer to the member for Isaacs is: no, we will not vote with Labor for their amendments—out of principle, and because of the need for this bill to be passed in its present form. Moreover, we will not vote for him, he who fears his political reputation by voting with us. I suggest the member for Isaacs join us on the yes side when the bells ring later today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  Newstart is too low. The government should act urgently to increase it. Australians living in poverty cannot wait for the next Labor government, and people on Newstart won't feel any benefit from feel-good motions from the Greens political party. The evidence is clear across the Perth electorate. Anglicare recently conducted the Share the Benefit challenge. This is about encouraging families to try living on Newstart for a week. Elizabeth, a year 11 student in my electorate, tried with her family to live on Newstart for a week. She's smart and determined and is going to go very, very far in this world. But she and her family could not do it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Perth we are facing a very unfortunate increase in homelessness, as many of my Western Australian colleagues know. This is, no doubt, a symptom of the challenges people are having living on inadequate government support payments. The national figures in May 2019 show that some 46,799 Western Australians are living on Newstart. Some 4,000 of those are in my electorate. When I say 'living', they are attempting to get by. Three million people live in poverty in Australia today, and 739,000 of those are children. Ten years ago this parliament acted to help lift pensioners out of poverty. We should do the same. It's time for the government to increase Newstart.</span>

I know that this is an issue of importance even for your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan. What it has meant is that areas in my electorate of Hinkler are now considered to be within the DPA, which of course means that this change will allow some practices in the Bundaberg area, in particular, to recruit restricted doctors such as overseas trained and Australian bonded doctors, providing a greater pool for greater services. This has been an issue for the people of my electorate for some time. Like all of us, I wish it would've happened a little bit earlier, but we have succeeded, the parliament works, and we've made changes which will make a difference.</span>

If you are a GP, a specialist or any form of health practitioner, there is no better place to shift in Australia than my electorate of Hinkler. Come and live at the beach. It's cheap to live. There are great people. There is plenty of work because one of the things we do have is an older demographic, and they have a greater need. They do need more health services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change to distribution priority areas will allow us to deliver more doctors into our region, and we simply need them to move. Come up. Live near the beach. You're near the barrier reef. You can see Fraser Island. You can eat seafood every single day, if you so choose. We've got fantastic schools, fantastic opportunities and plenty of houses for you to buy. We need your services. So once again I say: it's time to move if you are a practitioner in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Today I'd like to acknowledge the 25th anniversary of the Minchinbury Jets junior rugby league club. In 1994 the Jets emerged from the need for a local club to support an under-11s team. Prior to the club's creation, players had to travel to Parramatta or Penrith to join a team. Over its rich 25-year history, the Minchinbury Jets have provided an opportunity for almost 10,000 local kids and families to be part of a local sporting community. They've got a ferocious reputation in the league, having participated in 93 premierships, with 2019 set to be no different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently attended the 2019 launch of the Minchinbury Jets junior rugby league club. It also marked the official opening of the club's purpose built grounds at Federation Forest, Mount Druitt. Hundreds of children and families from all backgrounds joined together to celebrate the vibrant history and bright future of the club. Those players at the launch follow in the footsteps of past Jets who've gone on to play for Penrith and other NRL teams. I'm sure that the new home fields at Federation Forest will continue to be the training ground of champions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to take the opportunity to thank the Minchinbury Jets committee and all the volunteers for their tireless work, which has resulted in the launch of another successful season. I wish the players, coaches, team managers and parents who cheer on from the sidelines all the best for the remainder of the 2019 season. I'm proud to continue my support of the club for another 25 years of successful premierships.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Winter always hits hard, whether it's here in Canberra or in my electorate of Bonner in south-east Brisbane. The people who feel it the most are those who are down on their luck, sleeping rough or experiencing financial hardship. This year I began the inaugural Bonner Blanket Drive. I made the first donation of three new wool blankets, and I'm encouraging Bonner residents to do their bit and donate a blanket to my office before the end of July. To raise awareness for national Homelessness Week, I've invited the Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services, the Hon. Luke Howarth, to help me distribute the blankets during the first week of August. We will be donating the blankets to Rosies-Friends on the Street in Wynnum and to Bernie's Place at the Mount Gravatt Community Centre. Both organisations undertake tremendous work in our community and I'm a proud supporter of their ongoing efforts in Bonner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been blown away by the number of locals who have already dropped into my office in Wynnum to donate blankets. I'm pleased to represent such a thoughtful community, and it's the generosity and kindness of others that help when times are tough. So let's keep the momentum going. The blanket drive finishes in two weeks. Just yesterday, Martin and Sarah drove over from Cannon Hill with five new blankets. Last week, Jonty, a local Moreton Bay Boys School student, donated a couple of blankets. They don't have to be brand new. As long as they are in good condition and clean, we will accept them with open arms. If you'd like to make a donation, head to my office in Wynnum. A big thank you to the locals who have already donated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  With the winter months well and truly upon us, one would be forgiven for thinking that the local community retreats indoors to escape the cold. This isn't true in the Oxley electorate, with a buzz of activity throughout the community recently. This includes the $1 million redevelopment and reopening of the YMCA Jamboree Heights last weekend. The works were largely completed due to the fundraising efforts of the YMCA, with brand new facilities now open for the local community to enjoy. I was fortunate enough to attend the grand opening of the Cheryle Beadman Group Exercise Room. Cheryle Beadman is well known throughout the community, having worked at the YMCA for 25 years at reception and for over a decade as the group exercise coordinator. Therefore, it is only fitting that we name the new room after Cheryle, who has given so much to the YMCA.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge Eden Brighouse and Ryder Kelly, from the Redbank Plains Scout Group, who recently received their Grey Wolf awards. The Grey Wolf award is the pinnacle of the cub scout section, and there are a number of requirements involved in earning this huge achievement. These include an overnight camp, an interpack activity and using a map to plan and lead a hike/walk for at least two hours duration with a leader and a group of three to six cub scouts. My congratulations to Eden and Ryder, and to the wonderful Redbank Plains Scouts for their leadership in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Last Wednesday night I had the absolute privilege of attending the Suncoast Spinners wheelchair basketball. It is not very often that you have an absolute ball in this job, but this was an absolutely fantastic night. I went there thinking I'd be there for an hour or so, but 2½ hours later they were trying to peel me out of the chair! I had an absolute ball. The guys and girls there were absolutely inspiring, and it really gave me a different perspective on life. I'm a pretty lousy basketballer at the best of times, but trying to shoot hoops from a seated position, a metre lower than I normally would be, was really challenging. They go in hard, and they love their sport. For any of my colleagues who would like to get involved in community organisations, as most of us do, I would suggest they try and track down a local wheelchair basketball team in their own electorate. They really got a buzz out of me being there. There was a young fella there by the name of Dustin, who took a real liking to me. He is a great young kid. He didn't know my name, so he kept calling me 'new guy'. He would say, 'New guy, new guy, pass, pass!'—a terrific young bloke. I thank the Suncoast Spinners very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I rise today to welcome home the women and men of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballarat</span>. They were away for 259 days. I know that because Commander Paul Johnson said it as he arrived on the docks at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling </span>on Garden Island in my electorate of Brand. He said: 'Good to see you after 259 days'—I was fortunate to have been at the pier when they departed on 28 October 2018. There were 190 service women and men serving this country on the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballarat</span> as part of Operation Manitou in the Middle East. I was very pleased to join my parliamentary colleague the Minister for Defence Industry, Melissa Price, the member for Durack, on the docks. We had a great time witnessing the great welcome.</span>

It was a great welcome back to Perth at the homecoming of so many women and men who live in my electorate and serve this nation in the Royal Australian Navy. I'd like to also thank the commanding officer of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>, Captain Ainsley Morthorpe, for making us feel very welcome, and Commander Australian Fleet, Rear Admiral Jonathan Mead, who was also very good to both the minister and me on our visit. Mostly, I want to say thank you to the women and men of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballarat</span>. Welcome home and thank you for all that you do for our country.</span>

In my electorate of Robertson, there are more than 16,000. These businesses are a big part of what makes the Central Coast such a fantastic region to live in and to work in, and it's why events like the Gosford Erina and Coastal Chamber of Commerce Business Awards are so special. I was really pleased to be able to attend again this year and pay tribute to some of our outstanding local businesses.</span>

Brisbane Water Legacy was awarded Excellence in Social Enterprise—a fantastic achievement for Peter Lawley and his team. Blake Zibara took home the award for Start Up Superstar for his digital marketing business Happy Hippo Media. Excellence in Micro Business was presented to LEP Digital, and Excellence in Small Business was awarded to Coastal Gourmet 2U, owned and run by Russell Clarke and his partner, Cathy. I'd like to congratulate Gosford Private Hospital who received awards in four separate categories: Outstanding Business Leader, Excellence in Innovation, Excellence in Business, and Outstanding Employer of Choice. Well done to Matt Kelly and the whole team at Gosford Private Hospital. I offer my congratulations also to the Gosford Erina and Coastal Chamber of Commerce President, Rod Dever, and his executive committee, and the indefatigable Suzanne Hunter, from the Blue Mushroom events group, for putting together another successful awards presentation, and I thank the sponsors. To the finalists and winners, thank you for all you do for our region. I look forward to seeing all of you continue to grow and prosper and employ more people on the Central Coast.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  The International Energy Agency recommends 90 days of fuel and lubricant reserves, but, according to a recent report, we only have 23 days of aviation turbine fuel, 22 days of diesel and 18 days of petroleum. Not only does this put us in breach of our international obligations; it also leaves us vulnerable to shocks and disturbances in the energy market. And shocks and disturbances there could well be, as evidenced by the increasing tensions in places as diverse as the Strait of Hormuz and the South China Sea. The implications of Australia's dangerous complacency on energy are deeply troubling, not least because fuels and lubricants are essential for our economy and for our society and any supply disruption could bring both to a standstill.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must act on this issue and act urgently, starting with an immediate and detailed assessment of our reserves and domestic production capabilities. The government must review and implement the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to ensure we have a continuous supply of fuels and lubricants to match our national security priorities, and the government must also adhere to the IEA's recommendations and ensure that we do indeed have at least 90 days supply in reserve, because to continue the way we are would be short-sighted, dangerous and reckless in the extreme.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Today we honour the memory of Goldstein resident Anton Hermann, who lost his life in a cycling accident in Queensland. A long-time friend of Anton said he was a very special man who devoted his time to his family, his friends and his community. Professionally he was known as the pro bono community director at Minter Ellison. While I knew Anton for only a very few short years, his reputation in community involvement preceded him, most notably in his finishing role as Vice-President of the Jewish Community Council of Victoria. The JCCV have publicly declared his passing will be felt across the Jewish and wider Melbourne community owing to his genuine care and knowledge and his bridging of differences across political, religious and legal spheres, together with his personable, empathetic and honest approach. It's people like Anton who make our country great. Our thoughts are with him, his wife, Karen, and their children, Joel, Ella and Talia at this time. May peace be upon him.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Vision Australia Radio provide a vital service to vision impaired people across the country. Right now they currently receive some federal government funding, but, because of the rollout of the NDIS and the change to how people are funded, this service is now at risk. Block funding grants that they used to rely upon to run this service no longer exist. Without urgent assistance from the federal government this vital service will close. Why do we care? They currently maintain 10 Vision Australia Radio stations across Australia, including in parts of regional Australia. They have a station based in my electorate. They are staffed by volunteers who read out local stories, local content and local news for our vision impaired community. This service is vital. Many in my community argue that it keeps them connected with their local community. It's quality radio. Everyone should have access to listening. Everyone should have access to news. Everyone should have access to local stories, regardless of their ability.</span>

Quality services like this need to continue to exist so that the vision impaired living in regional communities can continue to know the local stories.</span>

He was recently recognised in the Queen's Birthday honours list for five decades of service to the WA wool industry and agricultural sector. At 84, Bob has an impressive resume of professional and community achievements. Bob arrived from Yorkshire in the 1960s and brought with him his love of family, sheep and cricket. </span>

He was integral in co-founding the Yardstick Central Sire Evaluation Scheme and the Federation of Performance Sheep Breeders Western Australia. He was a founding member of the Australian Merino Society. Bob has also spent time as President of the Australian Association of Farm Management Consultants, is a fellow of the Australian Ag Institute and helped drive the abolition of the Australian Wool Corporation's reserve price scheme in 1991.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  For a while now the Reserve Bank has had a consistent message for those opposite in the federal government—that is, to create jobs and keep growing the economy they must invest in key infrastructure. Ten years ago in this place Wayne Swan, a Treasurer who actually believed in investing in infrastructure for our nation, established the Building Australia Fund to finance critical national infrastructure, including roads, rail and port infrastructure. Unfortunately, since those opposite came to power the Building Australia Fund has sat dormant. The money is there; they've budgeted for it. Now I'm calling on them to actually invest it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, fortunately, there's an ideal significant piece of infrastructure for our nation that is very much needed and ready to go. The federal government can invest in the ship lift for Darwin harbour right now. This is the truth of it: Darwin is the most likely location for us to mount military, national security and humanitarian operations to Australia's north and north-west. Darwin also has the only functional deepwater port on the north coast of Australia. A Darwin based ship lift facility would offer significant strategic benefits to not only Defence and Border Force but also other users, and there will be savings to the taxpayer. I call on those opposite to invest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  For those of us shivering through this winter sitting in Canberra, the great news is that spring is not that far away. As the warmer weather starts to arrive, so do the wonderful community festivals that bring our communities together during spring. In my electorate, residents will have no shortage of options, from the Crows Nest and Lane Cove festivals to many of the fabulous school fetes that occur. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first cab off the rank in my area is the Moocooboola Festival, which is traditionally held on the first Sunday in August—so not quite a spring event but certainly the first. This year, 2019, marks the festival's 40th year, so there will be even more to celebrate. Moocooboola Festival, which is organised by Hunters Hill Council, has grown from a small street festival to a major event in Boronia Park, attracting up to 20,000 people. This year's festival is being held on Sunday, 4 August, and I'm sure it will be as popular as always. Over 120 stalls participate in the day, including food, health products, clothing, antiques, bric-a-brac, community and environmental information displays, products and much, much more. Of course, there's also great entertainment throughout the day and lots of activities for the kids. One of the highlights for me is judging the dog show, which is, without question, the most competitive part of the day and probably makes me more enemies than friends by the end of it. I know that this year's 40th Moocooboola Festival will be a wonderful day for the Hunters Hill community and those who travel from beyond to attend. It's a major logistical exercise and I congratulate Hunters Hill Council, particularly their events coordinator, Gabby Cleary, for their work in keeping the tradition going so strong.</span>

It's so devoid, in fact, that when faced with what they describe as the worst drought in memory, they came in here yesterday and made a lot of noise, but they'll deliver very little sometime in the future. In fact, it'll be $100 million next financial year. Such urgency! Across this parliament they'll deliver $200 million. It's lots of noise and very little action. To do this, they've highlighted the fact that, in the last six years, they've done nothing about spending over $3 billion that has been there in the Building Australia Fund. Like my friend the member for Solomon, there are things in my electorate they could have done with that Building Australia Fund. There's $10 million that we need for local irrigation for our farmers—growers in my electorate. That's $10 million, which is not that much money out of over $3 billion. They could give us $50 million in my electorate and we could join the two ends of the electorate by building the bridge over the Werribee River, connecting Tarneit with Wyndham Vale, but there are no commitments from this government to my electorate and there is no investment in infrastructure in my electorate. This government completely lacks a vision for this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I rise to inform the House about some important celebrations that occurred last week in my electorate of Bennelong in support of NAIDOC Week. This week is an important opportunity for all Australians to recognise the rich history and culture of Australia's Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities. The name of my electorate, Bennelong, was named after the famous Indigenous Australian Woollarawarre Bennelong who helped reconcile conflict between the British and the native peoples of the land. I take great pride in my area, which was originally home to the Guringa and Darug peoples of the Eora nation. The British arrived in Botany Bay just over 200 years ago; the Indigenous peoples of this country have been here for over 40,000 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I attended the NAIDOC Week citizenship ceremony at Ryde Civic Hall, an event where new citizens of Australia learnt about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and immersed themselves in their traditions. It is very important that we continue to improve relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people so we can find common ground and live together in good faith. My dear friend, Ken Wyatt, the Minister for Indigenous Australians, has asked us all to work together, and I'm sure we will.</span>

What is the government's agenda in this place this week? It's confected political wedges on drought, confected political wedges on national security and confected political wedges on the trade union movement and on asylum seekers. I suppose that is better than their agenda in the Senate this week—last night they ran out of any legislation to debate whatsoever.</span>

They won't have improved their healthcare or their education opportunities. They won't have improved their prospects of getting a job or pay rise. They won't have made a contribution to the fight against climate change. All they will have to show for a fortnight's work is headlines for journalists interested in the theatre of political tactics. Those opposite haven't yet realised that the election campaign is over. The Australian public deserves better, and the Australian Labor Party is up for better. Any time those opposite want to stop campaigning and start governing, we'll be here as constructive partners in this parliament, because we're here to serve the Australian public. That's the side that we're on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge Hardy Shum, the president of the Chinese Senior Citizens Club in Menzies, who was recently awarded Citizen of the Year in the City of Manningham. I have known Hardy for many, many years. Indeed, he's been the president of the Chinese Senior Citizens Club for about 15 years now. Each week, the Chinese Senior Citizens Club has a meeting in Manningham. It's attended by hundreds of people. I was delighted to be there just a few weeks ago to enjoy the celebrations of the Dragon Boat Festival and also the Mother's Day luncheon amongst the Chinese senior citizens. It was also my pleasure to present to Hardy and his committee on Australia Day one of the flags that fly in this chamber, which you, Mr Speaker, make available to all members of this place. Each year I present one on Australia Day to one of the community groups, and this year it was my pleasure to give it to the Chinese Senior Citizens Club. It is amongst many other ethnic senior citizens clubs in my electorate that do a wonderful job in providing a community for so many of the citizens of Manningham and of Menzies. I congratulate Mr Shum for his great work and look forward to continuing a great association with the club.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  We've come back to our first full sitting week after the federal election and what have we found before us? We have found a government that is bereft of agenda and is really all about being mean and nasty to the people of Australia. Let's look at some of the things that it claims to be an agenda for how it wants to run this nation over the next three years. It has an agenda of keeping in another country legitimate refugees who have decided to settle, to stop them from coming to Australia, whatever legitimate reason they may have—'No, we're going to be mean to that group of people.' Surprise, surprise!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we have from this government what I like to call selective freedom, because they've decided that they want to remove from union members the legitimate freedom to decide who their union leadership should be. They're happy to leave in control of businesses people who steal wages from our lowest income earners—they're happy to leave that—but they want to remove the freedom to decide who runs a member based organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then of course we have a pretty mediocre change to the deeming rate. It's just mean and nasty from this government. We have what we saw in the budget: the continued underfunding of the NDIS—not providing the full funding. They are continuing to be mean and nasty. Let alone what they're serving up to ordinary working Australians: anaemic wage growth. Then there's the underfunding of education under this nation. Last, but absolutely not least, they are not moving an inch on Newstart.</span>

In fact, Launceston has one of the largest refugee populations in Australia. Of the some 5,500 Bhutanese who called Australia home, around 1,500 of them have settled in Launceston and they're an incredible asset to the electorate of Bass.</span>

In fact, this is the second time Launceston has hosted the event since its inception in 2012, with the championship rotating between Australian cities with large Bhutanese populations. The week-long event comprised of 10 teams of boys and three teams of girls who come from Adelaide, Cairns and Albury-Wodonga and four of our own teams from Tasmania. They braved our wet and cold weather to compete.</span>

It was wonderful for Launceston to host this event, and I thank the organisers and the local Bhutanese community for making it such a success.</span>

But not only are we meeting our international commitments; we're also making substantial contributions to reducing the emissions of other countries, and we're doing that through the record growth in our LNG exports.

                  </a>  I was simply congratulating the member for Ryan on his excellent first speech in the parliament yesterday, and I congratulate him on his election to this place. Our government is on the side of all of those who want to have a stronger Australia, a stronger economy, stronger national security, a more secure environment into the future, a secure region. Our government is on the side of those who always want to see Australia strengthened by the policies that are taken into this place. And we are securing a stronger economy for Australia, with 296,000 jobs created in the last 12 months, 80 per cent of which are full-time jobs. If you want to know how well an economy is going, you look at how many people are getting jobs, and our jobs growth over the last 12 months was 2.6 per cent—above the two per cent we even put in the budget estimate—and that shows an economy that is creating jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have, as a result of our economic plan, an economy that is delivering comprehensive tax relief not just today, but ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn, because we on this side of the House believe that Australians should keep more of what they earn. That shouldn't be taken away from them, nor should the decisions about how they spend their own money. We all saw the circus from the opposition when they sought to oppose our tax relief, not just now but into the future. They worked against us. They worked against the government's delivery of tax relief; a $100 billion in infrastructure investment; an energy security plan that delivers reliability and that lures more affordable energy and increased supply and a better deal for energy consumers; securing our environment plan, which means that we are meeting our emissions reductions targets—and not just meeting them but smashing them when it comes to the Kyoto 2020 targets, having inherited a massive deficit from the Labor Party, not just on the fiscal books but on the emissions reductions books. We had to turn around a million tonnes in abatement over the course of our efforts, and that's what we have done. With water, soils and native vegetation management, we are listening to the farmers, who are the best environmentalists in this country, and backing them in on how they will manage our environment into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're protecting our national security, whether it's in our Defence forces, in the Pacific or standing up for the farmers who are being invaded—and the Leader of the Opposition's agricultural spokesperson was already speaking against the protection for those farmers earlier this morning—and we'll stand up against terrorists every single time.</span>

Obviously, as I've said, when a question is very tight without a preamble, that makes the subject area much narrower. For the guidance of members, I'm just going to say that ministers answering need to be directly relevant to the question asked. When it has a number of components, the answer can be very broad. Where it's a very tight question, things are much narrower. Ministers need to be on the policy topic. Equally, questions can't demand yes/no answers and ministers can't stray beyond the question. So it is up to the minister to bring himself to the substance of the question or wind up the answer.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. As I said, we're at the lowest levels of emissions per person in 29 years. They have been falling year on year. It is true that from year to year they bump up and down. There is no doubt that in the last year LNG exports have had an impact on our emissions. There is no doubt about that. But let's talk about that. In the last year, our LNG exports reduced global emissions by up to 26 per cent of our total emissions. When you sell LNG up into China, Korea—Asia—even though we wear the increased emissions from the extraction of that LNG, we see a reduction in global emissions.</span>

He has served with great distinction on the battlefield on behalf of our country, and he brings those qualities to the parliament. I had the great pleasure to join the member for Herbert in his electorate last week, where we met with farmers, graziers and small-business owners—some of the 70,549 taxpayers in the electorate of Herbert that will get a tax cut as a result of the coalition's legislation that passed this parliament. And 13,265 small businesses will be able to access the instant asset write-off, which was extended in the budget to $30,000 for companies with a turnover of up to $50 million.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can inform the House that, as of today, 3.2 million Australians have lodged their tax return for the 2018-19 year. That's nearly a 25 per cent increase on the same period last year. The tax office has seen over $3 billion in refunds make its way to Australian taxpayers' pockets. That is money to be spent at local businesses supporting Australian jobs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes we've made to the tax system are substantial. We have increased the thresholds. For the 19c rate, we have increased the threshold from $37,000 to $45,000. And we have lowered the rate. We have lowered the 32½c rate down to 30c. And we have abolished a bracket—a whole tax bracket. The 37c in the dollar bracket has been abolished. From $45,000 to $200,000, you will pay a marginal rate of tax of no more than 30c in the dollar. That is tackling bracket creep. So, if you're on average full-time earnings, you can get a promotion, you can get a wage increase, but you won't get a higher marginal rate of tax. </span>

We have seen again, in the last year, a reduction in emissions per capita, in emissions intensity and in the electricity sector. It is true, at the absolute level, that there was a small increase in the past 12 months. That was driven entirely by a growth in LNG exports, and that growth in LNG exports is reducing global emissions.</span>

Would not the super-reliable streams north of the Tennant Creek-Isa-Mackay line provide 20 Hughendens? Your Hughenden HIPCo irrigation grazing model is the only answer to drought, growing grass. Wouldn't this make you the modern-day Moses? But may not the 'evil tyrant' process turn 'El Banese' into Tutankhamun?</span>

He must have been sitting in the back stalls of my church on Sunday, because the pastor was actually talking about Moses on the weekend. So, you may have been there, in the back stalls. You're welcome any time, as any members are. I want to thank the member for Kennedy for this question, and I want to thank him for his strong advocacy of the Hughenden Irrigation Scheme. Together we have worked to ensure that we've committed $180 million from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund to build the Hughenden Irrigation Scheme. So far we know that it could capture and manage up to 500,000 megalitres of water, and this will grow primary production in the region significantly and ensure the best possible management of what you rightly describe as the scarce water resource.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, I met with the Queensland Premier on this, on 12 July. In that meeting there was strong support indicated, but I am concerned that other messages are being communicated by the Queensland government to the proponents of that project, and I'll be seeking clarity from the Queensland government as to whether they share our commitment to this project to see that it proceeds. We have already provided $2 million from the Community Development Grants Program for the feasibility study; $900 in funding has already been provided to the Hughenden Irrigation Project—or HIPCo, as it's known—to conduct that work. It's currently on track to deliver their second major project milestone by early August, with the final milestone due to be completed by early 2020.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I know that the member, like me, is frustrated by the time taken to get a lot of this done, and I want to assure him that our government remains as committed to this project as when we first discussed it and to breaking through the bureaucracy and the delays that have too long delayed these important projects. It's part of a broader set of work that we are doing to build water infrastructure in this country. And I remind the House what that includes, which I'm sure the Deputy Prime Minister would also. There's $150 million worth of construction already underway on the North Adelaide Irrigation Scheme in South Australia. There's $80 million underway in the South West Loddon Pipeline in Victoria. There is $60 million in the Macalister Irrigation District modernisation in Victoria. There is also money going into the Sunraysia Modernisation Project phase 2 in Victoria. There's $51 million in the Scottsdale Irrigation Scheme in Tasmania. There's $28 million in the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme in northern Queensland and $12 million in the Nogoa-Mackenzie Water Supply Scheme in northern Queensland. There's $352 million going into the Rookwood Weir in Queensland, and the preliminary work on that has commenced, and $396 million going to the Myalup-Wellington project in Western Australia. We're very serious about pursuing these programs. They're happening now, and our government is committed to the National Water Grid and delivering the water infrastructure that Australia needs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's all about water in question time today, as it should be because water is our most precious resource. The Liberals and Nationals know that the key to unlocking the potential of our regions is 'add water'—add water, store it when it falls and use it when it is dry. That is why we are establishing the National Water Grid, a new authority to take a visionary approach to water security right across this nation. It's time to take out of the debate the petty politics, the obfuscation, the delay, the bureaucracy and the parochialism and get on with building water infrastructure. That's what we're doing, as we just heard from the Prime Minister. We're getting on with building the water infrastructure that we need, that we want and, most of all, that we deserve. As I've said before, national leadership is needed, and that's what we're delivering.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transformational change is required. The National Water Grid will bring together the best science and scientists, the best people and particularly local stakeholder engagement—we want that local input—to provide strategic advice on planning, on project management and on delivery for water infrastructure and water security, like dams. We've already done much in this regard. We just heard the Prime Minister outline a number of projects—not an exhaustive list by any means. There is even more than what the Prime Minister said. We have been busy re-plumbing and helping to further drought-proof the regions. That's what is needed.</span>

As the members for Nicholls and Mallee would know, that $14.5 million will open up an additional 80,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture and farmland potential—unlocking the potential of those great Victorian regions. It's going to benefit, to boost, about 200 farms south-west of Echuca and north of Bendigo. They know how significant that is. It is an incredible investment by this government. It is going to be a good investment. It is going to unlock the potential of that region. But don't just take my word for it; let's hear what Mitiamo Pipeline Committee Chair, Neil Allen, said. He said:</span>

I know that in March this year he was in Mackay with Paul Schembri, chair of CANEGROWERS Queensland. He was there announcing a project about water quality and the Great Barrier Reef. But we can't do it without our farmers. We can't do it without our magnificent sugarcane farmers in the member for Dawson's electorate, in the member for Capricornia's electorate, in the envoy for the Great Barrier Reef's electorate, and so on. This is an example of farmers getting on with the job. The natural environment is inextricably linked with farming, forestry and fishing. We don't see agriculture and the environment at opposite ends of the spectrum at all. We know that our farmers, many of them represented by people on this side of the House, look after over 60 per cent of Australia's land mass. We can talk about policies, and we do, but we can't do this without our farmers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no better example than the Landcare movement, which celebrated 30 years just recently. As someone who was a family farmer for 17 years, and secretary of my local Landcare movement, I learnt so much from the wisdom of those land managers around us—some of them are Indigenous Australians, who have been managing this land longer than the farmers. The point that the environment portfolio would like to emphasise is that it and agriculture are not in competition. We are not in opposition. We are working together. We know that between us we can help with one of the key environmental and agricultural outcomes, which is healthy soils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was absolutely delighted to see that Major General Michael Jeffery has been reappointed as the national soils advocate. No-one who listens to Michael Jeffery could not but be a convert, if you weren't already, to the cause of healthy soils. He spoke at the National Drought Summit and he was outstanding. I'm delighted, Prime Minister, that his term has been extended and, in fact, his office has been embedded, ongoing, into this government. Healthy soils and sequester carbon support life. They support our precious biodiversity. They make a difference. And, in a continent with fragile soils, as Australia is, the more we can work to produce those healthy soils the better, and we have done that. We have continued $1.1 billion from the last budget to the next phase of the National Landcare Program, providing funding to June 2023. We will keep on this case due to the benefits from this project.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted that the minister for water resources and drought preparedness, through his strong representation of farmers, now has $100 million to disburse—all about drought preparedness—to build that resilience into our farmers, to support our landscape and to love and to look after our environment.</span>

                  </a>  but we do not have a plan to change the moratorium. It's as simple as that. That's the position. But I'll tell you what we will do. We will steadfastly focus on affordable, reliable energy for all Australians and we will not put in place policies that are going to double the price of electricity and triple the price of gas, as those opposite proposed at the last election.</span>

It is the fact that we, like any Western democracy, have faced a significant threat, and we still do today—we will do for all of our lifetime—in terms of those people who would seek to do us harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen some terribly tragic events in the United States, across South-East Asia and across Europe and we are not immune in this country. I want to make the point today that we have Australian citizens—people who have been born in our country and people who have been naturalised—who have gone off to fight in Syria and in Iraq and would seek to come back to cause serious damage, carnage and death in our country. So we've provided support to our national agencies, not only through financial support but through the ways in which, in this parliament, we've been able to pass 17 tranches of significant pieces of legislation to support those agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government went to the election, as we go to every election, saying to the Australian people, 'We will do everything within our power to keep Australians safe.' We made that promise at the last election. We will live it during the course of this term of government and for many years beyond. We do it because we have had seven attacks in our country, and we've had 16 major disruptions in relation to imminent attacks that had been planned in our country, since September 2014. We know that 73 people have been convicted of terrorism related offences since 2001 and we know that 98 people have been charged as a result of counter-terrorism operations since 2014.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the government is now asking for the support of this parliament to introduce legislation, which has been used in the United Kingdom, to temporarily exclude those people who we believe would come to our country to cause death and carnage in Australia. The parliament deserves to support this legislation because the Australian people deserve that support. That's the reality.</span>

The Minister for Home Affairs has already pointed out how critical and necessary this bill before the House—the temporary exclusion orders bill—is. What our agencies tell us is that the many Australians who have fought or otherwise supported Islamic extremist groups in Syria and Iraq are self-evidently radicalised, skilled in terror techniques and very, very dangerous people. They present a serious national security challenge that needs solving. That's why I was astonished at what was said by the member for Cowan this morning in the debate on the temporary exclusion orders bill: 'This is not effective and not impactful legislation.'</span>

She said them clearly: 'This is not effective and not impactful legislation.' This is not a technical argument about whether an amendment from a committee was adopted in part or in full. This is a fulsome rejection of the critical importance of this bill. And what was even more astonishing was the reason given as to why this bill is not effective or impactful—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact they are migratory is the point of this legislation. This government has, as its first priority, the protection of the Australian people. The one place, as an absolute priority, where we will invest every effort and every resource to prevent migratory extremists turning it into a theatre of war is Australia. That is why this legislation is necessary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's previous experiences with Australians returning from conflict zones demonstrates the threat they can pose.

I have been very clear about this in public. I have no association and have remained at arm's length at all times from the company, Jam Land. In 2017, I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the EPBC Act. I make absolutely no apology for seeking and receiving a briefing on policies that seriously impact farmers in my electorate, because I care about farmers in my electorate. It is what the people of Hume expect from me as their local member. The most remarkable fact is that other affected members, such as the member for Eden-Monaro, didn't do the same. I will always stand up for the people of my electorate. I will do the right thing by them at every point in time.</span>

Obviously, the government has been strong and consistent on border protection for a number of years—necessarily so. When we came into government in 2013, there was a disaster. That was because the Labor Party had given up sovereignty of this country and allowed 50,000 people to arrive on 800 boats, and 1,200 people had tragically drowned at sea. During the election, we said that, if Labor were elected, the boats would restart. People thought at the time, 'Well, of course, they would say that.' The reality is that boats had already been put on the water during the election campaign in anticipation of the member for Maribyrnong—remember him—becoming the Prime Minister of this country. That's the reality. A vessel with 41 people on board, headed our way from Sri Lanka, almost went to the bottom of the ocean, and fortunately those people were saved and returned to Sri Lanka. There was another vessel, with 20 people on board, and we were able to intercept that and return those 20 people. Those people no doubt would have landed here under the Labor Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an amazing difference of approach on this policy between our side of this chamber and the other side. But it's hard to know—because I am asked about alternative approaches—what the position of the Labor Party is today. You might remember that in the last parliament it was very hard to know what Labor stood for, because their policy chopped and changed. Remember our old friend the member for Blair? He was a champion of the side! He was working up, over a three-year period, to ask a question on boats. But he never got there. He is a man who has been cut down in his prime, and it's sorry to watch. He was building up to a question. There's no doubt about it! The only problem is: he didn't know what question to ask, because the Labor Party have been in favour of turnbacks; they've been opposed to turnbacks; they've been in favour of offshore processing; they've been against offshore processing; they've been in favour of temporary protection visas; they of course are opposed to temporary protection visas. All of that which has worked to stop the boats, to make sure that we can get kids out of detention, to make sure that we don't have people drowning at sea—the Labor Party still this very day stand opposed to every one of those measures.</span>

In 2017, before I was the minister in this role, as I answered in the previous question, I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the EPBC Act. The reason is that those changes impacted the farmers in my electorate. I care about the farmers in my electorate. I wanted to see that drought fund go through yesterday, despite the protestations from those opposite and unlike the member for Eden-Monaro, who takes no interest in the farmers in his electorate. The department of the environment have confirmed that the briefing did not discuss compliance action. They have confirmed that.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government warmly welcomes Prime Minister James Marape's historic visit here to Australia. Australia has no closer friend than Papua New Guinea. This is underscored by the fact that the first visit Prime Minister Marape made was to Australia. It's also the first official visit by a head of government in the re-elected Morrison government. Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Marape met yesterday for the inaugural leaders' dialogue, which I was pleased to join, with many of our colleagues here from both Australia and PNG. This was a significant delegation. I want to note that now we'll have an important annual leadership dialogue, every single year, with Papua New Guinea. </span>

This new elevated partnership will encompass economic aspects and joint prosperity. It'll tackle shared security challenges together, and it will build on our personal connections, such as our ties through sporting programs, cultural links and church relationships. I want to thank the opposition for their support for Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Marape's initiative. Our parliament is united on this important relationship. </span>

I want to particularly note that today is Papua New Guinea's Remembrance Day. It's a good day for us to reflect on our shared history that encompasses ties that were deepened through the trials of war. Papua New Guinea was the Tobruk of the Pacific. The service of the PNG people in, literally, carrying our soldiers on their shoulders, defending their country and defending our country, will never be forgotten by this parliament or by our country. </span>

As we celebrate the 40 years of defence cooperation, Australia has committed a further $20 million to further strengthen our defence partnerships and ties. New initiatives will continue our joint work on PNG's Lombrum Naval Base and we've agreed to continue to explore and extend opportunities for our security relationship, infrastructure development and information sharing. </span>

It will enable prosperity. It'll build the business relationship. It'll mean ongoing deepening of our ties. I also want to particularly note the warmth of the relationship that we have with PNG. I will quote Prime Minister Marape: he referred to all of us as 'PNG's brothers and sisters'. </span>

This is a grubby smear from those opposite, one of many that have been made, and were made during the election campaign, and I have been very clear on this. This was not a discussion about compliance action. It was a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the EPBC Act. And the secretary of the department has made very clear—and I quote: 'I can be very clear that Minister Taylor has never raised the issue.' This is the point. I make no apology, though, Mr Speaker. I make no apology for acting in the interests of the farmers in my electorate, and it's about time that those opposite stood up for the farmers in their electorates.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:53</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for her question, because she is absolutely focused on the interests of her constituents, including her farmers, her hardworking small businesses, the families and the industry that provides so many of those crucial jobs to the people of Robertson. She is focused on a fair deal for energy, as are we. A fair deal for energy can be achieved, delivering a strong economy, whilst we reach our international emissions obligations. And we'll achieve those on the back of a record $25 billion of renewable energy investment in the pipeline right now. We are leading the world per capita. It is double the next country in the world. Our challenge now is to ensure that we have enough reliable generation in the system to keep the lights on and to keep power affordable for all Australians. That's why, from 1 July, we introduced the Retailer Reliability Obligation, which requires the energy companies to guarantee supply to meet the needs of their customers three years ahead of time. It's also why we've created a program to underwrite new reliable generation into the market to push power prices down and to keep the lights on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's simply not enough to have power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. We need it 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. That's why we're sharply focused on keeping our existing coal and gas generation in the market running at full tilt. But there are alternative approaches. If you take Victoria as an example, the state Labor government, through their ideological focus on reckless targets, has simply trashed their grid, forcing reliable energy generation out of their grid. That has already led to blackouts. Last January we saw 200,000 businesses and households in Victoria lose their lights. They lost their power, yet the state Labor government has done nothing to improve the reliability of their grid since then.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in this place, with the reckless targets that it took to the last election, Labor has committed to roll out that same approach across the country. Worse still, during that campaign, those opposite failed to answer the most basic questions about the costs and the impacts of their policies, whilst independent modelling told us that those policies would double the price of electricity and triple the price of gas. Only the Liberal-National government can be trusted to deliver a strong economy and a fair deal on energy.</span>

I have been clear about that. That's my job, and I do it all the time. As I said, at this meeting that the member opposite refers to, I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of this revised listing. But I would point out that, since then, an independent review by Wendy Craik, released only about a month ago, has found that there have been major deficiencies in how the act is understood and, in particular, how farmers are dealt with. I'm pleased that this review specifically identified the very issues that I have previously raised and that were raised in this meeting, because I will always act in the interests of farmers. Perhaps those opposite could learn a little bit from that.</span>

Minister, Hobart City Council yesterday voted in support of pill testing at major events and festivals. We know pill testing saves lives, and health experts agree a harm minimisation approach is the only sensible response to illicit drug use, yet the Tasmanian government is clinging to an ideological opposition to harm minimisation, and pill testing in particular, and refuses to back the council's position. While some like the ACT government have taken a lead on this, governments like Tasmania's have shown they simply don't understand the issue. So will you as health minister put the issue of pill testing on the COAG Health Council agenda?</span>

Yesterday I respectfully disagreed with the member for Clark on the proposition he made. Today I will respectfully but categorically disagree with the member. What he has proposed is, I believe, a dangerous and unfounded course of action. Let me say this: whether they are tested or not, MDMA, ice and certain opioids such as fentanyl can be deadly in their purest forms. These are drugs which are illegal for a reason. They are illicit drugs because they can kill. They are illicit drugs because the nature of the response may not be known in an individual case. At the very moment that this parliament, this government and the entire nation are seeking to deal with some of the challenges of both amphetamines and opioids, the idea that we would be condoning, encouraging and supporting the expansion of their consumption is, to my mind, utterly unthinkable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is not a position that the Australian government will be adopting; it is a position that the Australian government will be opposing. We have given the fullest support that we can possibly give to the position of the Tasmanian government. The reason we do this is that we want to save lives and protect lives. We know that not only may there be flaws in the pill-testing approach but, even if it makes it clear that it's a pure form of MDMA, a pure form of ice or a pure form of fentanyl, that is not going to save a person. They may take an overdose or, even if they take what they believe is an appropriate dose, that can be enough to take their lives. That's why these drugs are dangerous, that's why these drugs are illicit and that's why we will not be adopting the approach which the member has—I believe, foolishly and dangerously—advocated.</span>

Whether it's as individuals or whether it's within our families, our friendship groups, our community groups or our workplaces, we know that mental health is a challenge that will affect four million Australians in any one year, and suicide will, sadly, take over 3,100 Australians, according to the last year of full figures available to the Australian government, so this is something of profound importance. We're taking steps locally and nationally and for the long term.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the local level, during the election campaign, with the advocacy of both the member for Bass and the member for Braddon, we were able to announce an adult mental health centre for Northern Tasmania. That will be located in Launceston, in the member for Bass's own electorate. This is something which has been a personal passion and a personal advocacy campaign, and to have achieved so much so quickly is a real measure of the integrity of spirit that you bring to this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the national level, one of the critical things in dealing with suicide is recovery and rehabilitation after somebody leaves hospital. We know that the chances of somebody again attempting suicide, or completing suicide, after they have been discharged from hospital, having been admitted after an attempted suicide, are the highest in the country, in all the different ways of cutting the figures. That means that, whilst this is terrible, we have one particular opportunity here—that is, we know the very individuals who are most at risk.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend and thank former Prime Minister Julia Gillard for her comments today and her work at beyondblue. We are working with beyondblue on their The Way Back program. We started with the leadership of Jeff Kennett and the baton was passed to Julia Gillard, and she has been magnificent. We are supporting The Way Back program with a $37 million government initiative. It will track the individuals—firstly in 25 groups. We want to work with the states to spread it across every single patient who is ultimately discharged from hospital and has to face the task of recovery from attempted suicide or suicidality. </span>

We want to work with Christine on a decade-long plan to address this crisis, to deal with this crisis, and ultimately give every Australian a way back.</span>

I didn't ask those people to come to a meeting. My understanding—it has been drawn to my attention since then—is that there was actually a compliance officer there. It is very clear that on that day I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of the revised listing under the EPBC Act. This is a big deal for farmers—something that those opposite wouldn't understand. It affects the small businesses who farm in my electorate and all of those businesses that depend on them. It is my job as a local member to make sure that they get a fair deal. As I said in the previous answer, an independent review by Wendy Craik identified that there were serious issues, which I'm pleased now that the government is acting on. It will ensure that farmers are better able to work with the EPBC Act and, hopefully, will reduce red tape for farmers, who are the greatest custodians of our environment.</span>

We know that for our economy to grow, to keep Australians secure in their economic growth, we need to be supporting our small and medium enterprises. We also know that many of our small and medium enterprises are very time poor. They are very focused on working in their businesses, making sure that they are doing whatever it takes to keep their businesses operating on a day-to-day basis. Often, because they are so tied up working in their businesses, they don't have the opportunity to work on their businesses.</span>

The Southern Queensland Innovation in Export Hub in Toowoomba will open next week, but it is already working to help our local businesses grow and develop. While we were there, we met with a fabulous local small business called Jim's Jerky. Emily Pullen from Jim's Jerky said: 'One of the things we really see as a business is that Australian beef has an amazing reputation overseas. We would love to take that to another segment, which is snacking.' This is a business that is growing opportunities. It is taking Australian beef and developing a new snacking product that it will be looking to export.</span>

Members would be aware that the tellers are now recording the votes during divisions using iPads. This system is delivering immediate publication of the results and other information on divisions for observers of proceedings. I'm now pleased to advise that, resulting from this innovation, a new House division database has been developed that will make divisions in the House available to observers, including the public, immediately and in a format which will enable the searching of division information and collecting of statistics. The new webpage is now live on the APH website under the House of Representatives chamber and business documents.</span>

This will provide a more effective display of information about proceedings before the House, as well as the display of division results after they are announced. I thank the House, and I will keep members informed of future developments. Thank you very much.</span>

In the context of those two words—that descriptor—I was, in fact, referring to making a point about laws in general being limited in their effect and impact and their capacity and the need for a longer term, more comprehensive response to effectively deal with the threat of terrorism. The Attorney-General also used my words about terrorists having a migratory nature and, in that context, insinuated again that I did not support the current legislation. For the benefit and the education of those opposite, having a migratory nature means that they would move to a combat zone. This is a term that's used quite widely in terrorism literature, and I would suggest that the Attorney-General read a book.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  And you are so right, Mr Speaker! In beginning my contribution to this debate, I'm going to ask my colleagues to do something for me, and I warn them in advance that it is a big ask. I want them to imagine for a moment that they are the current Prime Minister's agriculture minister. I know that's a little bit confusing because, at the moment, they have two trying to clean up the mess. But imagine you are the member for Cook's agricultural minister, and you're lining up for an interview. The journalist asks you what should be a pretty basic question. She asks, first of all: 'What is the fairest way to measure how successful the government has been in agriculture over the course of the last six years? And how would you measure the performance of your government against those criteria?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those circumstances, you might think that the minister's hard drive is running over and thinking about productivity in the sector over the last six years. But as the minister, you're immediately saying to yourself, 'No, I can't go there because productivity has been flatlining in the agriculture sector for all of that period of time.' Then you think to yourself: maybe I can talk about farm profitability. But, no, then you remember reading the latest ABARES report, which tells you that net farm incomes are down 15 per cent this year, so you're not going to go to profitability. Maybe you can talk about grains production. No, you're not going to go there. Maybe you might want to talk about slaughter numbers—no. You might want to talk about the herd size in Australia, now the lowest in more than 20 years, but, no, you're not going to go there either—the value of production, the output of the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister was in Dubbo last week. He said he supports the NFF and its ambitions to grow the sector to $100 billion annually. The problem is that in the last three years it's gone from $67 billion to $65 billion to $64 billion. The sector is going backwards not forwards. This government took it there and it has no plan to turn those numbers around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of an opportunity to talk about how it's going, you might think that maybe we can talk about forecasts. Maybe you could argue that all the hard work is about to bear fruit, excuse the pun, and talk about where things are heading. But, of course, that becomes a bit problematic too, because all the forecasts are looking pretty much the same. Wool production is forecast to fall seven per cent. Slaughter numbers, as I mentioned, are forecast to fall nine per cent. ABARES is predicting that export earnings in the whole sector will fall five per cent over the next 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a pretty fair person, and I accept that much of this can be attributed to drought. Our food and fibre producers are in the grip of probably the worst drought in the history of the nation—certainly the worst drought in some areas in this country. It's seven years in the making. It's dryer and hotter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will park that aside for a moment and return to that, because one of the ministers seems very interested in that subject. If you're the minister you may want to talk about the achievements of the government in the agricultural sector, some of the initiatives the government has taken in this space. Then, of course, you're asking yourself, 'Can I really talk about the centrepiece, the 2015 white paper?' I don't think so—</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FITZGIBBON:</span>
                  </a>  The member for Paterson says, 'gone'. Yes, no-one on that side. We waited two years for it. It was the centrepiece of their agricultural policy in the lead-up to the 2013 election, the agricultural white paper. Remember I used to have the weekly media release? Another week has passed and we still don't have an agricultural white paper. It left as slowly as it came. Let me talk about some of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might want to ask yourself how the dairy code of conduct is going? It was recommended by the ACCC, I think, in late 2018. Our farmers are now being told that they don't get a code of conduct until July 2020. By the way, going back to the numbers, I asked people in the agricultural sector how the dairy farmers are going on the watch of this government. I will ask them whether they believe this government has done anything meaningful to help them. Of course, the answer will be no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were the minister would you talk about the wheat port code? Of course you wouldn't. Guess what? No-one talks about it anymore, because it only covers one exporter. This government introduced a wheat port code that now only covers one exporter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe the minister might be thinking about the agriculture visa. Do we remember the agriculture visa? Minister, your Prime Minister talked about it pretty regularly. He was going to have one. Then he wasn't going to be have one. Then he was going to have one again. Of course, we have not heard anything of it, certainly not post the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to visas, what about the deal they did with Nick Xenophon to get the backpacker tax through? Remember the backpacker tax? Instead of helping the workforce issue in the horticulture industry they made it worse. They did a deal with then Senator Nick Xenophon. What was the deal? They were going to continue to pay people an unemployment benefit while they picked. Remember that? How long did that last? I don't think any minister would be using that as an example of some of the success stories of this government. How many dams did the member for New England build in the end? I said, at this despatch box in 2013, that he will never build a dam. No, he never did. We're still cleaning up his mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the white paper's rebate to help farmers secure multi-peril crop insurance? Where is that now? I remember it well. They spent more on marketing the program to farmers than they handed out in rebates. It was so successful! You'll be interested in this, Deputy Speaker Hogan: what about the money to produce more co-ops? Everyone loves a co-op in rural and regional Australian, don't they? They love a co-op. The white paper was going to give us co-ops everywhere—a co-op here, a co-op there and a co-op everywhere. Of course, no-one ever talks about that program any more. The list goes on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What represents one of the most important entities in the agricultural sector? It's APVMA. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority ensures that the chemicals our farmers use are safe for both them and their workers and for the food that we consume. Our veterinarians rely on the APVMA to make sure they have access to the right drugs for both our primary production animals and our companion animals. How is that going these days? Not very well. That is because the member for New England decided to put himself ahead of the farming community by pork-barrelling that authority all the way to New England. The only reason it still has a heartbeat at all is that the government—having realised it was such a mess—now has more than 50 scientists and regulatory lawyers working here in Canberra, contrary to its own policy rule. The CEO of the APVMA was forced to get legal advice to tell him that he can continue to employ people in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't even start on the farm household allowance, because I have ran out of time. But there will be a bill later, and there will be plenty of time for me to talk. Minister, we will be talking about the way you allowed the boss of your department—now Bridget McKenzie's department—to be sacked because Barnaby Joyce misled this chamber to cover for his own incompetencies. This is a government full of people who talk about our farmers but, on a regular basis, put their own political interests ahead of the interests of our farmers. There's plenty of evidence of it. When we get to the farm household allowance bill, I'll be talking more about them. We want to hear more policy from this government and less political spin.</span>

You get this courage, you come out from under your rock and you decide that you are going to stand up and stand for something after six years of doing nothing but being a lapdog to the policies of a Labor Party that doesn't care about regional and rural Australia. Lo and behold, he has found a voice! It is a big voice! It took a near-death experience, and the National Party is coming for you. Let me tell you, we came very, very close. The Nats are coming because we have a delivery. Let me tell you, it's because we believe in agriculture and we believe in what agriculture stands for.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you about what agriculture has done. We have gone from a $34 billion industry to an over $60 billion industry in eight years. Let me tell you why we do get ups and downs. It's a thing called the weather. Those opposite don't understand that. We are on a trajectory to get to a $100 billion industry by 2030. That is because of the environment that we put around the agricultural sector. We put a big framework around that yesterday. We put in place a future drought fund that will go to $5 billion, paying $100 million a year. Those opposite had to be brought kicking and screaming to this.</span>

                  </a>  I will. Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. As you'd know, I'd never pass that upon you, but the member for Hunter obviously has a long and proud record of doing nothing. So, let me say: we do have a proud record of putting the environment—and the drought has been one of the biggest challenges we've faced, yet he turned his back on it. The member for Hunter did nothing and in fact tried to stop us, and there was not one question, in question time, since I was ag minister, for the 16 months I was there—not one question from him. But let me say that we've also done a lot of reform over the last 16 months that I was ag minister to help take this industry to over $60 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go back to one of the sectors the member for Hunter quite proudly talked about, around dairy, and the cruel hoax he put on dairy farmers during the election campaign—to politicise their misery by telling them they were going to get a floor price. But he wasn't going to give them that. He was going to give them a review by the ACCC to look into it. Well, let me tell you—and how you can save the taxpayer a couple of million bucks—we got a report from the ACCC on 30 April the previous year. It said to put a dairy code of conduct, not a floor price. It was reckless—a reckless, cruel hoax that he was promising and touting to dairy farmers around this country. It was a disgraceful act preying on their misery.</span>

                  </a>  They did, because you promised them something you could never deliver. That's why people hate politicians—because they go on and tell them what they want to hear. You've got to have the courage, you've got to have the ticker to stand in front of them and tell them the truth. That's why we've acted, and we're putting in place a dairy code of conduct—exactly what the ACCC said. It's coming in next year. This is why it's dangerous that someone from that side could ever be ag minister—because there are contracts in place; there are intricacies to this market that you do not play with, and you do not undertake actions that are rash, that would actually have perverse outcomes. You didn't even think about that, nor care. It was all about trying to make a cheap point—preying on these people's misery, a cruel hoax that you knew you could never deliver. And the ACCC, in that report on 30 April, had already said that the only way to deliver this was through a mandatory code of conduct. Lo and behold, we're delivering it, and it will come in in a responsible and methodical way that will deliver.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then we went further. We went to put in place a market platform that gives greater market opportunities for our farmers. We announced this during the election campaign. It would have been great if the opposition spokesman had been able to see that—and for many other commodities. Let me explain it to you in simplistic terms. I want to keep it with you, because you weren't here. The member for Hunter was hidden under that rock, so he probably didn't hear a lot that was happening during the campaign. The member for Hunter was hiding. He was in exile all right. Let me tell you what happened. It's like with many other commodities, like cotton, like grains: you're able to hedge a product. These are the types of things that give a market opportunity.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, you were hidden under that rock; you were hidden, my friend. But we made sure that we gave them real options—sensible policy that would be long-lasting and sustainable, not just to get us through an election cycle. That's what real leadership is: to stand up and be honest, and to back your farmers with something that's real. But let me go further on what we've been able to achieve in the last 16 months: the Craik review into biosecurity—an extra $313 million into biosecurity. We are delivering all 42 recommendations, lock, stock and barrel. If we do not undertake serious measures around biosecurity, I can assure you that we will lose our clean green image.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make sure that we understand how important that is to us all—I'm losing my breath; I've got so much to talk about here—but let me just go back. While he has got this new-found courage, it's funny that when we were talking about milk—and I will go back to milk for a minute, because it is important—I do recall the member for Hunter standing here chastising me about attacking supermarkets for not giving dairy farmers an extra 10c. He absolutely lost it over the fact that I would have the temerity to go out there and attack supermarkets. I stand by farmers, not big corporates. The member for Hunter was tucked underneath the board tables of Coles and Woolworths—he was hidden with them—and I went and had conversations. Let me tell you, it took courage to stand up to those supermarkets and have the conversation. And do you know what? We broke the back of $1-a-litre milk because I had the courage to stand up to them. We had the courage on this side, and we've made sure that that's now giving real returns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we've gone further. We want to talk about the APVMA. We believe in decentralisation. This side believes in regional and rural Australia. It believes that they can do it just as well as people in Canberra or anywhere else. If we empower them and undertake to invest in them, lo and behold, business will follow. When we took over, the APVMA was getting 34 per cent of applications done on time. The APVMA's performance is now at over 70 per cent, and we have decentralised to Armidale. I was in Armidale and I sat there. I actually went there to listen rather than to stand in Canberra in the bubble—as you're slowly learning after the election. I listened to the people who have moved there. In fact, I met one of the senior scientists, who was in Geneva before coming to Armidale. She made the comment to me that if this had not been decentralised to Armidale and had stayed in Canberra she would not have come back to Australia to work for the APVMA. She believed in the lifestyle and she also believed in the strategy of being close to a university. This is about making sure we get results. This is a strategic move that has delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you also about ag visas. We have changed around the policies in respect of bringing in foreign workers to help us get the food off those vines and off those trees when we need to. But do you know what? The responsibility of the Australian government is first and foremost to keep its people safe. You make sure that if you make any changes to the visa system you do it in a sensible and methodical way where you do not put Australian security at risk. The Prime Minister made it very clear at the NFF council meeting when he said that we would work towards it but we would have to do it in a sensible, methodical way. That is why we take the advice of specialists in intelligence and in defence who can tell us how we can do this. This is the reality of good government. It's not about trying to politicise for a cheap, tawdry point. These are achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my greatest achievements as the agriculture minister over 16 months, of which I'm proud, is that I took female government board representation from 37 per cent to 47 per cent. I was able to right the wrong of the past, and it's one of my greatest achievements. I can be proud of it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  The story of agriculture over the last six years has been a terrible indictment of the government, and I'm pleased to support the member for Hunter, our shadow minister for agriculture, who, with me, has been working with our farmers, as have many of the other members who have regional electorates. But before I refer to some of these terrible failings, I would like to comment on the answers from the member for Hume in response to the questions today from the member for Griffith. He made the claim that I wasn't responding to the farmers of the Monaro. The interesting thing was that he claimed he was representing his constituents. Of course, the Monaro is not in Hume. Funnily enough, the name refers to the fact that it's in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. So his interest in farmers is curiously specific and limited to the farmers of the Monaro.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had journalists come to me and ask me about the story affecting the member, and I've refused to talk to them because I make it a practice to never impugn the integrity of members in this place—or outside this place. But he got up in here today and slagged me off, saying that I wasn't representing the farmers of the Monaro. Let me tell you that no farmer in Monaro, no constituent, has raised this issue with my office. I went back and checked through all the records. I have had representations from constituents about the story affecting the member for Hume. And I'll leave it at that. But for him to attack me on this issue—he evidenced the fact that he was looking at an issue that didn't represent the interests of his constituents but the farmers in my electorate. I leave others to draw conclusions from that. His answers were very revealing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond that, we've seen other issues of self-interest emerge in this whole story. The shadow minister for agriculture, quite rightly, talked about the APVMA saga—a terrible saga, for many reasons—but where was it relocated to? Can we remember where it was relocated to? It was relocated to Armidale, in the electorate of New England, the Minister for Agriculture's electorate. There are a few things that occurred as a result of that. This organisation was critical to our farmers, and this action of decentralisation, so-called, wrecked it. They lost 30 per cent of their scientists straight off the bat. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that organisation was here was that it was close to the CSIRO and other tertiary research institutions. It was also a convenient place for peak organisations of our farmers to conveniently visit and be here in the centralised location of the organisations relevant to their interests and needs. That's what the peak organisations representing the farmers have said. That's what the dairy farmers' association and the MLA have said—that this decentralisation does not make sense. And it doesn't create new jobs in the regions. It's been taking jobs from this region to another region. It's stealing from Peter to pay Paul. The ACT is the Bush Capital. It was created to be that, and it supports the whole of southern New South Wales and the farmers that exist in this region. So this was a short-sighted issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It reflects the other damage that the minister created in relation to water policy: the Murray-Darling Basin—we're seeing all that come back to haunt us—the interventions he made in the work we were doing on droughts, in terms of the COAG committee process and looking to move beyond the exceptional circumstances regime, which was not serving the interests of our farmers, and dealing with the more exigent circumstances of drought our farmers are facing. He killed that off and replaced it with nothing. Then we had no answer to the droughts that have been affecting us lately. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also took away the measures we put in place to assist with our live export problems. As could well have been predicted, it came back again to bite us, in relation to the live sheep trade. Every time there is an instance like this it erodes the market for our producers, our meat producers. Butchers are telling me that every time one of these videos appears people stop buying their meat. It affects the market, and it affects the image of this country as a clean, green, healthy animal-welfare exporting nation. So the damage he did by taking away those reform measures came back to bite him as well</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were so many things. The backpacker tax was mentioned. That skills deficit in the bush is still a huge issue, and that really poor policy impacted my fruitgrowers in Eden-Monaro, my wine growers. Even today, the RAI have reported that there are 44,600 vacancies in rural and regional Australia. There is a massive skills deficit that is only being exacerbated by the policies of this government towards our TAFEs, which people in country areas know are vitally important, and which you've got to start putting some effort back into.</span>

                  </a>  Where is the farmer? You talk a lot about agriculture, but where is the farmer? Here we are, listening to an MPI, and I've been very interested to hear the comments about live export. The opposition have said they were going to completely shut the live sheep trade. In Western Australia, the damage that that would have done would have been to the multimillions of dollars that that industry is worth to Western Australia. What's worse is that what's not well understood on the other side is the effect it has on small, regional communities. This would be exacerbated right across Western Australia in the areas where the sheep are produced. Someone like the livestock transporter was frequently the only person in a small community who was driving that local economy. The fuel supplier, the local store, the employment and the mechanic are all part of that supply chain and value chain. That was at risk. The farmers were at risk from their climate change policies—that open-ended, not costed climate change policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  There are going to be very few speakers on a whole bunch of topics if you can't stand and speak in this place and represent your constituencies unless you're actually somebody from that background. I'm supposing that the person opposite will never speak on industrial relations, because she's never represented a worker. I'm guessing that there's a whole bunch of people who've never worked in hospitality who will never speak about penalty rates and who will never, in their lives, speak about aged care, because they've never lived in aged care themselves or represented workers. That's not how our democracy works. The job of elected representatives is to represent all of their constituents, regardless of their industry. We're not in an exclusive club that says that only farmers can speak for farmers and only retail workers can speak for retail workers. Basic 101: you're an elected representative to represent your constituents in this place, and that is what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are calling the government to account on today is their absolute failure in agriculture. It's not just about our farmers; it's about our farm workers, the workers in the supply chain and the small businesses in the agricultural supply chain. Our farmers are integral. They are the people who manage the farms that produce the produce that underlies a lot of the Australian economy. We do need them, but we can't focus just on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, whilst those in this place are ranting and raving, the NUW released a report. They surveyed just under 700 farm workers. Their findings are alarming, yet no-one on the government side has even looked at it. Today's report looked at farm workers—the people working in horticulture who are picking our fruit and vegetables and packing our fruit and vegetables that are sold in Coles and Safeway as we speak. The report found that these workers are being paid on average about $15 an hour. That's well below the minimum wage. But that's the average. Some people are actually being paid less than that. In some cases people are being paid $1 or $2 an hour in our country on this government's watch. Some 68 per cent of the farm workers said that they were being paid cash. They know it is wrong, but that is how the contractors, subcontractors and, in some cases, farmers were choosing to pay them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is most alarming. For all the government's talk about being tough, standing up, making sure we're safe, protecting our borders and making sure that people are on the right visas, 67 per cent of workers confessed to being on the wrong visa—not having the appropriate work rights in this country to pick our fruit and vegetables. This is on this government's watch. They are forcing vulnerable people, who have come to this country, to work in a black economy on our farms. This is underpinning our agricultural industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is failing. They've danced around an agricultural visa. They've danced around changes to backpacker visas. They've danced around changes to improve the integrity of the seasonal worker visas and of the Pacific Islander visas. But to this date they have not stopped the systemic wage theft, they have not stopped the exploitation, they have not stopped the hot housing—10 people living in a caravan and being forced to work long hours on our farms—and they have not stopped the physical and sexual assault of young vulnerable workers on our farms in Australia. It's nothing short of modern slavery standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear a lot of talk in this place about agriculture, but there is no real road map of how we are going to improve productivity. I've focused a lot on farm workers in this, but there are a number of other areas where this government is failing. If you have 100 per cent turnover of your workforce every picking season, your productivity is going to be low—fact. There is a real lack of training and a real lack of planning when it comes to our workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the agricultural industry and how it underpins food manufacturing jobs. This government doesn't talk about manufacturing or the fact that 25 per cent of all the manufacturing jobs are actually food manufacturing jobs. Let's talk about SunRice. If we don't grow rice, we won't have jobs at SunRice. That is hundreds of jobs. If we lose milk and don't have dairy, we will lose manufacturing jobs. When it comes to agriculture this government has no concrete plan to roll out to secure the industry and to secure the jobs.</span>

It is just an absolute joke. I said yesterday in this House in relation to agriculture that you have to be very careful when you listen to the Labor Party talk because they say one thing but had actioned themselves to do, if they were elected on 18 May, something totally different. Now we have the member for Bendigo raising the issue of illegal workers throughout the agricultural workforce. It's a great fear of mine that she's 100 per cent right. But what the two parties are going to do about this is totally different. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to understand that there could be thousands of people who have come out here on a legal visa and are currently fulfilling a crucial part of our workforce. A crucial part of our work is being done by people who have possibly stayed too long. We don't know the extent of this problem, but what are we going to do about it? What the Victorian Labor Party is going to do about it is smash them overnight by introducing legislation to fine people $500,000. What we actually have to do is put some thought into how we fix this problem of labour without smashing our agricultural industries. You can't do one without the other, unless you're the Labor Party, who have no idea and don't care about the consequences of these types of labour force amendments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have to acknowledge is that the picture of agriculture is actually reasonably rosy, if you have water. Right around my patch—around northern Victoria and the Goulburn Valley—everyone wants to talk about the drought at the moment. To help people understand what's going on, we've had 11 weeks of good rain, but that's not going to fix the drought in our area because the price of water is still $600 a megalitre and the price of grain is over $500 a tonne, so all the pressure points that are associated with the drought are still in place. But we just need another good 10 weeks of rain and we'll be through the rough part of it. Many of the dairy farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley—which represents far more dairy farmers in any one patch than anywhere else in Australia—will get through this if we can support them, and that's what we've been doing. With the farm household allowance, we've been there to support them. With the low-interest concessional loans, we've been there to support them. We've been there to help the grain growers through this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This side of the parliament is working hand in glove with our farmers on a whole raft of actions, and then there are a whole range of policies and actions on the side of Labor, who want to take more water out of active and productive agriculture. They want to take more water away from our farmers. It's in their policies. Two weeks before the election, they produced one of the most damning policy papers that you could ever read. The member for Bendigo actually had to come across to the Goulburn Valley and try and defend it, and she was totally unable to defend the document in a debate with the Minister for Agriculture. She had no idea about the water policies that the member for Watson had put in place for the Labor Party. To take more water out of agriculture and force the price of water even higher, to put out there a policy paper that is all about the health of fish within the Murray-Darling Basin, but being totally—</span>

                  </a>  It was a 24-page water policy that didn't mention farming or farmers once, and I don't think it mentioned agriculture. This is what the Labor Party do. And now they come into this House and they want to be taken seriously as a party that has an idea, an understanding, about what the levers are that give farmers and the agricultural sector an opportunity to make money for themselves. We all know that, in the regional parts of Australia, all you need to add is water. And if we can add water, we have the best science and the best farmers, whether it be in horticulture—citrus and almonds, which are the high-commodity areas—or in the dairy industry, which is our traditional area. It's the National Party and the coalition that are going to support our farmers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I just want to draw back from the rolling stock report that has preceded much of this debate and say that there are two things we have been devoid of in this country for the last six years. One of them, sadly, is water. We do know that there has been a horrendous drought across most of our productive farmland in Australia. The other is policy. This government, for the last six years, has shirked and squirmed and hid from the farmers of Australia. and I want to speak directly to those farmers of Australia and say that this government has not served you well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I get out to the regional areas very often. In fact, I married a farmer's son. I know the regions well. I live in a region. And I've heard the talk from across the aisle. They get on the back of the ute and they say: 'Oh, the Labor Party can't manage money. They just want to tax you to hell. They don't know what it's like out here in the bush.' They've been telling you the same story for 50 years. For 50 years, they've trotted out the same old stale policies. And let me tell you: agriculture in Australia has not prospered under a coalition government. It has not. In the last two years alone, regarding the produce that is grown in this country, the value of everything that is farmed in Australia has fallen to $58 billion, from $63.8 billion two years ago. That is not an increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Milk and wool production have been affected by the drought, that is true, but this government have hidden behind a policy hiatus for the last two years on milk and wool alone. You have done nothing meaningful to help the people you actually say you represent. And what a disgrace the National Party are. They represent some of the poorest electorates in our country—people who are really struggling at this time, not just to put food on the table, as regularly trotted out by the minister for water. He likes talking about kitchen tables and utes. These people are actually struggling financially and psychologically, and the Nats have done absolutely zero to meaningfully help them. That's the curse of what we're discussing today: this government's abject failure to help and properly represent the people they always say they want to represent and do represent. They do not represent them all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were the floods in Queensland—yes, I know. I've heard the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, talk about the destruction of the herd in Queensland. We indeed know how dreadful that was, and we also know that it's impacted live cattle exports, but, again, we've seen nothing meaningful from this government. When Scott Morrison became the Prime Minister last August, one of the first things he did was go to Quilpie, in South-West Queensland.</span>

                  </a>  I referred to when the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, became the Prime Minister in August last year. He went to south-west Quilpie. I want to talk about when he was in Quilpie. He stood up and he talked about how dire things were in Quilpie and then he was asked about drought relief and drought recovery, which was good. He talked about those two things. But then he was asked about climate change and he said:</span>

Last August, the Prime Minister was talking about 'here and now', and yet last night, here in this chamber, in this parliament, he put through a bill touting to help farmers right here, right now. The money won't be drawn down until next July and you still don't know what you're going to spend it on. I beg the farmers, the fibre producers and the food producers of this country: do not be hoodwinked by this faux farming government. They do not have your best interests at heart. They have not produced a good policy. This is not drought relief. They are not helping you today and they won't help you tomorrow. Shame on this government. They are a terrible indictment on the farming communities of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr McVEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to rise and speak on this motion, which, by its very nature, invites the obvious compare and contrast, and I intend to do just that. We can talk about facts and we can talk about the record. Let's just focus on that first. Australia's total farm production is estimated, as others have said, at $60 billion in the past year—up 25 per cent since we came to office. The value of agricultural exports was estimated at $50 billion—up almost 30 per cent since we came to office. In the past 12 months this government have continued to invest in a range of incentives to support our very important agricultural industries. They've invested an extra $300 million in a biosecurity system. Agricultural exports are continuing to be supported, in terms of their growth, with an extra $50 million in the last 12 months. They've invested $10 million in areas of digital transformation for agriculture, including, as referred to earlier, APVMA, significantly improving their processes and turnarounds to support farmers through this government's initiatives. In the 2018-19 budget, expenditure on Agriculture and Water Resources portfolio responsibilities was estimated to be $2.32 billion. That's an increase of $1.53 since we came to power, such is the significance of our investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to a whole range of very significant initiatives, in particular, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural competitiveness white paper</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>which has been<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>discussed already. The Regional Investment Corporation was established in Orange as part of our decentralisation strategy to support the Commonwealth Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme and farmers in need, such as the National Drought Agreement, which our Prime Minister has played such a key role in. In particular, one that excites me is the innovation policy paper<span style="font-style:italic;"> Agric</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ultural i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nnovation—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">a n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pproach to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">row Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uture</span>, released by the previous minister for agriculture earlier this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech in this House I spoke about the importance of the agricultural supply chains in our country—the value chains. Many refer to them as paddock-to-plate initiatives. I refer to them as life in regional Australia and how regional Australia lifts more than its fair share to support our great country. We consider the whole supply chain—and I fear those opposite don't do this enough as it's too big a picture for them. Just today we heard the environment minister in question time talking about Landcare and healthy soils and the science minister talking about technologies that continue to support agriculture and manufacturing. It's part of our DNA right across the board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On animal welfare, who is it who has been stepping up in terms of live exports and the challenges that have to be faced? It's the coalition. Food labelling and the importance of consumers, not only here but around the world, understanding the country of origin for our excellent agricultural products has been discussed. Drought and the response to the significant challenges faced around the country has been discussed. It's our Prime Minister and it's our ministers—it's our leadership—who have stood up. As I mentioned, for research and development corporations, the focus is on innovation. There's infrastructure to get our products to market, to port and to those export markets overseas that we're trying to grow. Agriculture food processing and all of those industries in the supply chains to which I refer are largely small and family businesses. It's for them we've been providing tax relief, because we understand how that whole value chain works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is getting behind manufacturing—for example, meat processors. In my home state of Queensland that is the biggest manufacturing industry in the state. And there's security for our farmers and our processing facilities to get those activists out of their faces to let them get on with their jobs. It's our side of politics that secured the free trade agreements that mean so much to the future of agriculture in our country. What has the opposition done? Nothing. They're kicking and screaming against support of our drought initiatives. For infrastructure, in Queensland's case, our state colleagues will not step up and participate in Inland Rail or water infrastructure at Rookwood Weir and Emu Swamp Dam. The examples go on and on. For example, we've seen Labor attacking owner drivers. They just don't get it.</span>

                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have been in power for six years. In those six years we have seen nothing but abject failure for farmers across the nation. No matter where you look the National Party, the fringe dwellers of the parliament—remember, the National Party can't even garner five per cent of the vote nationally—do not represent people. The only people they represent are the likes of Rinehart and corporate farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to family farms, family farmers know the one thing that can be guaranteed is the National Party selling them out in the blink of an eye. We've seen that even this week, as farmers struggle through drought, needing help and support now. This lazy mob opposite have gone out and put a bill in that does not send any money or support to farmers for 12 more months. At the same time, in the house of snooze over there, one of the Queensland senators got up and said that the Victorian government must end its ban on fracking. Farmers who are struggling to pay to put food on the table and to pay their bills are being forced by this government to comply with the desires of multinational gas companies. Those opposite don't want to see the continuation of farming. They want those farmers to sell out. That way, they can get the gas from underground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, if you cared about farmers—if you actually cared about regional communities—you would be out there supporting the Andrews government in ensuring that farming land stays for farmers, not for gas companies. But no: this government, this coalition, come in here and for six years have done nothing but short-change farmers and rural and regional communities. We saw that when SPC was in trouble. The only level of government that did not want to support SPC, a national brand, was this federal government. They walked right away. It was up to the state Labor government to step in and keep that business afloat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You heard earlier one of the incoherent rants from those opposite about water. Well, let's talk about water. Six years of this government has seen the death and the destruction of the Murray-Darling Basin—Murray cod of over 100 years of age, floating up rivers because this government has been asleep. You sit there and ask, 'What is going on?' For 100 years these fish have lived in these rivers. They've survived every drought and everything that's been thrown at them, but now they can't, because this mob have failed them—and failed them miserably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about the APVMA. If you ever want to see brilliance in National Party politicians, look at the member for New England, who took away our central organisation, and for 12 months they had to work out of a McDonald's in Armidale because they had no ability to do their job. We've seen the issue we have with bees in Australia—another problem that's happened on this government's watch because they're asleep at the wheel. While standing up and fighting hard to get tax cuts for people earning over $200,000 a year, they've decided to sell the family farmers down the street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They do not care. They have never, ever come in here and actually stood up for farmers. The National Party like to pretend they're tigers out in the country, when they get up here, get straight on the lap of the Liberals and do nothing. We saw that with the Building Australia Fund. Last night, as I said, we saw them bring a bill into this place and ram it through without proper consultation, without proper debate, to greater fund help to farmers—not this year, when they need it, not when they're struggling after many years of drought, but off in the never-never. But what they're doing is raiding $3.9 billion out of the infrastructure fund that means rural communities like the ones I represent can't get roads done, can't get rail transport done, can't get support, because they're taking it to try to pork barrel the Nats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are the ones who suffer because the National Party are not the country party anymore. That's long gone. That's dead and buried. All they are is city-based MPs, sitting there putting on an akubra and pretending they represent the bush. But they don't. We saw today the minister for emissions increase openly stand in this parliament and not tell the truth about farmers in the area that the member for Eden-Monaro represents. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  There's often very little that we agree on in this place, particularly during matters of public importance. But I think one thing we need to agree on is that elections are effectively opportunities for the citizenry of Australia to pass their judgement on the relative performance of governments. Now, news flash for those opposite: we had one of those occasions on 18 May this year, and the people of Australia passed their judgement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Effectively, the member for Hunter and those opposite's thesis on this matter of public importance is consistent with what I heard directly after the election—that is, the people of Australia got it wrong. I had hoped that they had come to their senses at least one or two days after the election. I understand the pain, when you've taken out a mortgage on a new flat in Canberra based on your new purported ministerial salary, that you're struggling with the hangover from the pre-election victory celebrations that were to no end. But, surely, in the middle of July, you shouldn't come into the House of Representatives and suggest that the people of Australia got it wrong. And what you definitely shouldn't do, in the middle of a drought which is gripping rural, regional and remote Australia is come in here and say that the farmers of Australia got it wrong. They didn't get it wrong. They know who stands up for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You heard the member for Groom indicate that total farm production, in the years since we came to government, has gone up 25 per cent to $59.5 billion. That didn't happen solely because of the actions of this place. That happened because of hundreds of thousands of farmers around the country and the support. It was supported by the work of this place. In particular, I want to draw the House's attention to the free trade agreements we established in the course of the last two terms. What they're doing is opening up markets. What they're doing is giving farmers in my electorate the opportunity to take agricultural outputs from a certain value to another value. It's providing export parity. It's doing all of those things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite want to say: 'Hang on a minute. In the last 12 months, total farm agricultural output has gone down.' News flash: there's a drought on. Do you know what happens during droughts? Maybe those opposite don't. There are very few of them that live in rural and regional Australia. When there's drought it's not as easy to produce what you produce when you have average rainfall or above average rainfall. No wonder the wool clips are down. There have been lots of sheep that have had their heads cut off, because they're in drought. There's no livestock out there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing to look at the outcome of the 18 May election. I note that those opposite achieved, I think, close to a historically low primary vote, but I want to reflect on the electoral success or otherwise of the member for Hunter. He is, effectively, the agricultural spokesperson for those opposite. To his credit, he's someone who does represent a rural and regional electorate. Regarding my colleagues on this side, I've really struggled to find anyone who went backwards. Most of them achieved a higher primary vote than they did in 2016, and many of them had strong swings to them. That's the people of their electorate voting for their strong performance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish the member for Hunter was here. A quick review of the AEC website shows close to a 9.5 per cent swing against the member for Hunter—yet he comes in here and has the audacity to say that his opposite number has underperformed. The people of Hunter think differently. It was a 9.5 per cent two-party preferred swing. It was close to a 14 per cent reduction in the primary vote. That speaks volumes. What it says to those opposite is: the people of Australia cast their judgement on you. The people of rural, regional and remote Australia, I hasten to say, were even harsher than the rest of Australia were on average. Accept their verdict, get on with working with us collaboratively, stop playing the politics that we saw last night, stop getting on with those parlour games, because the people of South Australia and regional Australia, and the rest of Australia, will continue to punish you for it if you don't.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HRI" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I rise in support of the amendments proposed by the shadow Attorney-General. In relation to this issue, some tense comments have been made in the course of the morning, but I'd like to try to draw back and bring back some sanity to this discussion. This is important for a number of reasons. We have had—and it has been commented on—a great history of bipartisan collaboration on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. To be part of that effort in the interests of national security is probably one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in this parliament. I have great respect for the coalition members who have been working with us on that committee; and I have great respect for the chair of the committee, the member for Canning, who brings not only his service background to that endeavour but has been patient and deliberative in his work. And we have produced good results in the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments, the recommendations that we have worked through, particularly with the intensity of the workload over the last six years, have been significant. We have faced real threats. And there are real concerns from the agencies, which we have listened to and tried to deliver the outcomes they have sought. I have to say that that 17 tranches of legislation that the Minister for Home Affairs refers to required a lot of work. Frankly, in the process of rushing those through the committee, there was a lot of work that needed to be done to repair them to deliver the outcomes they sought. The committee worked together to produce those outcomes. In particular, I want to commend the shadow Attorney-General. He and his team did the work of a department in producing over 300 recommendations to achieve just that. Poor drafting was highlighted in the public and private hearings we conducted. Those 300 recommendations were accepted and it was a joint effort on that committee to achieve those outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did that work in the same style and the same manner again in relation to this temporary exclusion order legislation. The recommendations were put forward in good faith on the basis of the legislation that was presented. As has been mentioned by the minister, this was modelled on the UK measure produced in 2015. So this is something that could have been in process at any time over the last six years—or at least since the UK model was reflected upon in 2015. So there would have been time for us to revisit any substantive redraft of this legislation before the committee. And what we are proposing is that that be the course of action—that this legislation be referred back to the committee and done on an urgent basis. We could do that work, however long it took. In the course of this week, we could've got that work done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of issues in particular. The committee produced 18 recommendations altogether—and I noticed that there was some quibbling over what was accepted and what wasn't. In the few minutes I have left to speak in, there is one particular issue of concern that needs addressing, and that is the question of constitutionality. Both sides of politics, in these last 10 years, have experienced issues where approaches we have taken in policy have been struck down by the High Court when there's been a belief by governments that it was all kosher. We've had specific expert commentary reflecting on the constitutionality of this legislation that needs to be answered. And we are putting that forward in the interests of making this legislation effective and not making it vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've supported the legislation—although I have some personal concerns with the approach, which I will come back to. In the circumstances that the agencies are in, in dealing with these returnees, this legislation has been indicated as being important to give them time to respond to preparations for receiving these threat elements returning from prescribed areas, that we have outlawed under legislation, and most likely participating in crimes against humanity, against international law and fermenting terrorism within Australia from those remote locations. It would be in our interests to make sure that they are effectively prosecuted when they return to this country, and we understand the need for preparation for that. However, there are circumstances that need to be addressed in resolving this constitutional challenge and in providing the committee and the parliament time to carefully consider the bill in detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also comment that this legislation, this approach of temporary exclusion, has been criticised by a number of authoritative institutions in terms of the security outcome we seek to obtain here, and that includes the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and the Lowy Institute. Even the executive council of the Australian jury and the Law Council have commented on the risks that may be generated by taking this approach to this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another issue here too, which is that we are putting a burden on our Kurdish friends, who are not a state. They don't have the structures and the institutions of a state. They have been brave. I worked with the Kurds in the year that I served in Iran. They are the most reliable ally that we have. They have held the heavy burden in this fight against ISIS—above all other stakeholders involved in this effort. Yes, men and women of the ADF provided wonderful support to enable them to achieve results, but they were the ones largely doing the fighting and dying in the field against these horrendous, heinous criminals, and now they're asking for help. This is a huge burden for them and they need help. We've seen ISIS move from the conventional combat phase of operations. Now they have morphed back to their traditional style of terrorism, and transnational terrorism, and that is their effort to grow and spread their terrorist acts across the globe, so this international threat requires an international effort to deal with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has highlighted that that is the fact and has called on those countries with citizens in this situation to take those people home and deal with them. He's well aware that there's a risk there that these threat elements will spread out to areas where they can operate with impunity, they can be welcomed as heroes and they can operate in ungoverned spaces. We've seen this story play out before in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The exact words of Mike Pompeo were:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have an expectation that every country will work to take back their foreign fighters and continue to hold those foreign fighters, we think that is essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's our major ally. That's the Trump administration. This is not some social democratic administration; this is our key ally and the Trump administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Pompeo also said that the West would 'never have to fight these same terrorists again' if we took this kind of action. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have rounded them up, they are now contained and they need to continue to be contained so they cannot present additional risk to anyone anywhere in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is important, because the truth of the matter is that more than 100 Australians have been killed since 2001 in overseas terrorist attacks. That is by far the greatest threat and risk to Australians. Australians are great travellers. Our kids and retirees are out there touring the world, visiting interesting places, which can be risky. It is in our interest to ensure that we limit the risk that they face when they are travelling where they have faced the biggest threat of being killed and maimed in large numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can look at that story. It happened in New York, Bali, Barcelona, London and Sri Lanka. Australians have been casualties of terrorist attacks in all of those venues. I will just cite one story that brings that home to me. In 1995 there was a gentleman who the Sudanese government had in their custody that they wanted to return to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabians refused to take him back because they had revoked his citizenship. This goes to this other measure that we have looked at here in terms of revocation of citizenship. They wouldn't take him back, and so the Sudanese government in 1996 sent that individual to Afghanistan. That was in 1996. After that happened, that individual, whose name was Osama Bin Laden, caused the bombing attacks on the US embassies in Darussalam and Nairobi—hundreds killed—the attack on the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cole</span>, and 9/11. That led to the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and thousands and thousands of people being killed, all because his citizenship was revoked and he wasn't taken back by the country who owned him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the potential risk that we run in doing the same to these citizens of ours who would have a special interest in targeting Australians and who were engaged in fomenting terrorist action in Australia from those remote locations. This is the risk we are running in taking this approach. I personally feel that we should have a regime in place here where we can take these people back as soon as possible and restrain them—those arrangements seem to already exist in a lot of the legislation we've already produced through the committee and in this place—to keep them off the streets while we pursue possible prosecution or at least the safe tracking and containment of those individuals. That, I think, would be the more prudent, secure and risk-eliminating approach to take for Australian citizens. We've seen the situation where individuals go back to a country where they had a second citizenship, for example Libya, Lebanon or Pakistan, and we know what could potentially occur from there. There are ungoverned spaces in all of those places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a real problem that we need to deal with effectively here. We support this bill as one option for dealing with this problem in certain circumstances. Obviously, the agencies have indicated they need time to prepare for receiving these people in the circumstances that they are operating in at the moment, so we don't oppose that. But what we do say is that this legislation needs to be looked at again in the form that it has been presented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make one other comment before finishing. I've put special emphasis on the fact that this has been a bipartisan committee. I have spent more than 30 years of my life immersed in the security affairs of this nation, fighting these terrorists and dealing with these issues, only in the national interest. When I was security adviser for Bill Shorten, I worked closely with Peta Credlin to make sure that our approach was bipartisan. I made it clear to her that all she had to do was tell me this was needed and we would work to make these things happen. So I find it extremely worrisome that the government, in its approach to this legislation, is leaving open the accusation of politicising this issue, as evidenced by comments such as, 'Whose side are you on?' That negates the very democratic institution that all of this is meant to protect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, beyond that, it's a personal insult not only to the general members here, who are all proud Australians—but I've worn this country's uniform in four different war zones, putting my life on the line to fight these people. No-one can say to me, or to the member for Solomon, who served in this country's uniform, 'Whose side are you on?' The member for Maribyrnong served in the Reserve for this country. The member for Moreton wore the Air Force Reserve uniform. Don't say to them, 'Whose side are you on?' Argue the merits of this policy. Don't deny the valid role of this institution to debate and analyse these types of legislation, because it's important we get the balance right between civil liberties and action on security but also deliver the right outcome. We are entering into the commentary on this legislation in good faith. Don't question the patriotism or the intent of the members on this side. I won't stand for that. We won't stand for that. Just engage in an honest debate with this. Use the institutions that were created to deal with these matters. Let the parliamentary joint committee do its work. It's done good work. It will do more good work as long as we keep the politics out of this.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  It's important to be clear on what the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019, which we are voting on today, will do. Under this bill, if it passes, this will be the state of the law: the minister could refuse to allow an Australian citizen back into the country, even though that person has committed no crime. That decision by the minister is not reviewable by any court or by anyone else, and the minister can keep on doing it again and again and again. In other words, if this legislation passes, the current Minister for Home Affairs has the capacity to say to someone who's travelling overseas: 'No, you are not entitled to come back to your family, to your home, even though you've committed no crime, and there are absolutely no checks and balances on that power. If you think I've made the wrong decision, you cannot do anything about it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing the rule of law slip out of our hands. Under this government, we are seeing—and have seen time and time again—some very basic principles of Australian democracy in our constitutional system getting trashed. Up until a little while ago, the idea was that if someone suspected you'd done something wrong you would get taken in front of a court and if you'd done the wrong thing you'd get punished and could potentially be imprisoned. We are now moving a world away from that to a point where not a judge with all the facts, where there is a right of reply, but a minister, who is making a decision behind closed doors, gets to determine whether they think you've done something wrong—or, not even that, whether they think you might do something wrong in the future, even though you haven't done anything wrong already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, we're moving away from a system where you do something wrong, you get brought before the courts and you get prosecuted. We are moving away from that. We are moving to a system where someone thinks you might do something wrong in the future; therefore, you get punished. That is not what other countries are doing, despite what the minister has told us. We are going further here than places like the UK are in dealing with the threat of terrorism, and in so doing, some very basic principles of individual liberty and the rule of law are slipping from our grasp.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The attempt to move this bill in its current form is clearly an attempt by the government to wedge Labor. It's nothing more than that. You can absolutely see that, because the government was prepared to introduce some safeguards a little while ago and now they've backflipped. It is crystal clear to anyone who is looking at this that this government has no agenda. It was elected as a one-trick pony. That trick has happened, so now they've got to fill the rest of their time, and they are thinking, 'What can we do to try to wedge the opposition?' That much is crystal clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will support the opposition's amendments to this bill, because they try to make a bad bill better. I will support the move to refer it back to the committee to try to get some of those amendments back in. I say all that in the context of us having been very concerned about the work of this committee and the closed-door deals that it does and the fact that it locks out third-party voices in this parliament. What it usually ends up doing is proposing legislation to take away people's civil liberties, which gets rammed through this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put that aside; I'll be supporting the amendments. But I do plead with the opposition to reconsider their position if their amendments don't get up either here or in the Senate. This is what the coalition government is doing in week 2 of its term—trying to say that the minister is able to bar you from coming back into this country to live at your home or see your family, even though you've done nothing wrong. That's what they're trying to do in week 2. And if you give in now, imagine what it's going to be like at the end of three years. I and the Greens will fight hard to defend principles of rule of law and democracy and liberty in this country. Over the next three years, because we know that this government will stop at nothing—there is nothing they won't do, given that they've got no agenda; there is no line they won't cross—we are going to need to be very vigilant in this parliament in defence of some of those basic principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through in a bit of detail what this bill does. Under this bill the minister can issue an order to say, 'No, you are not allowed to come back into the country.' That applies to citizens as well as others. So, that's the first thing people need to know. This is going to apply to all of us. People might have in their minds, 'Oh, this only applies to someone who is potentially coming here who might have lived in another country or grown up in another country.' No. To the Australian born and bred, the Australian citizen: this will catch you. If the minister thinks you might commit an offence of a certain kind related to terrorism when you come back in here, then the minister is able to say that you're not allowed back in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is different to the United Kingdom legislation that the government has spoken about many, many times. Under the United Kingdom legislation, the idea is that you've done something that counts as a crime first. There's a test; there's a threshold. So, it's not just that someone sitting behind a desk thinks, for their own political reasons, that you might do something in the future. There is a threshold. It's much more consistent with the basic principles of the rule of law. That is not in this legislation. In other words, to get pinged under this you don't even have to have done something wrong in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister can also act if they get advice from ASIO. What's notable about this is that the advice from ASIO that the minister says they're acting on is not challengeable or reviewable, even by an Australian citizen. In other respects, ASIO's advice against you is challengeable. But this government has gone out of their way to say, 'No; we're going to introduce a new kind of advice from ASIO in this legislation'—where someone can just pick up the phone and say, on a nod and a wink, 'I think someone's a concern.' Then the minister can say: 'Well, that's good enough for me. I'm going to deny them entry.' And there is nothing you can do about it, as an Australian citizen, if the minister says, 'Well, I've just got this advice, so I'm going to make the decision.' There is no protection built in for you under this legislation. In the United Kingdom, before they're able to do something like this to you they go to a judge. Here, they don't have to go to a judge before they make the order, and then you, as the citizen, if the order's been made against you, don't have the right to take it to a judge afterwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, this man who is sitting at the despatch box right now, the Minister for Home Affairs, is the one who can determine, for every single one of us in this country, whether we're allowed back in or not, to see our home and our family. There may well be some very legitimate instances in which there are some people to whom we say, 'No, you've committed a crime; something should happen to you.' But there might be a bunch of other people who have done nothing wrong and, out of a misunderstanding, you think, 'Well, they might do something in the future.' What can you do if you get one of these orders made against you? It's why, in the United Kingdom, you can challenge these things in court. It's why a judge gets involved and why you don't give one person—this man here, the member for Dickson—the power over you and your life. But that is what this bill will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There would have been some safeguards in it had the amendments that came out of the committee passed. Would they have been adequate? Probably not. Would this bill have been better than what it is? Yes. But those amendments aren't in this bill. They were argued for for a very, very good reason. That is because we are slipping into something other than democracy when we give one person the unchallengeable power to say, 'You are not allowed into this country even though you are a citizen'—or even if you're not a citizen. One person could say unchallengeably, 'You as a person are not allowed into this country.' That is of grave concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that we are dealing with complicated issues here, because there may be instances that are covered by this bill where there is someone who has done something heinous against Australian citizens—for example, being involved in a terrorist act overseas that might have claimed the lives of Australian citizens. Every one of us would want to have a discussion about how to deal with that. My and the Greens' starting point would be if someone has committed a crime, bring them back here, try them and sentence them. If they're found guilty then make them live out that punishment. That is how the law works. There is not a case where the law is broken in that respect. We can prosecute people and put them in jail if they have done things that are terrorism crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill goes much, much further than that. It also deals with the complicated question of children. This bill will apply to people as young as 14. Someone as young as 14 could get caught by this. When you're dealing with children, you're most likely to be dealing with something where it's actually the parents who have made the decision on behalf of the children and it's not the children themselves who are at fault. To say Minister Dutton has the unchallengeable power to keep a child out of the country because of something that their parents might have done is an affront.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I accept that these are complicated questions. Whether it's an innocent child who's now having the sins of the father visited upon them or someone who has committed a heinous offence overseas that everyone in this country would think is appalling, there are many from across the spectrum who argue that the best thing to do with those people is bring them back here, try them and put them in jail. This stops it. This says Australia cannot only keep them away—and I stress there are going to be two categories of people who are caught by this. There'll be the ones who have committed crimes or done wrong, which most people in this country would think deserve to be punished, and then there are going to be other innocent people who've done nothing wrong at all but that the minister has decided—perhaps out of mistaken identity; who knows—to make an order against. But we'll never find out about it, because you're never going to be able to bring this case to court; you're never going to have any daylight shone on it. We will never know if, tomorrow, the minister decides to keep people out of the country who've done nothing wrong unless a journalist tells us about it. We will never know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are those two categories of people who are caught by this, but, with those who have done wrong and who most people in the country would accept have done wrong, you have to question whether or not you say, 'No, we're going to close our doors to you rather than bring you in here and try you under our judicial system.' What are they going to do? Where are they going to stay? Do you really think the world will be a safe place if Australia decides that, rather than bringing back someone who has committed a terrorist act against Australian citizens—while they were on holiday, for example—and trying them and putting them in jail, we will shut our door and let them roam the world? Is that really what we're saying? Is that really how we're going to make the world a safer place? No.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people across the political spectrum who are saying countries should not be allowed to shut their door to their own citizens who've done wrong and that those countries should be responsible for taking them back and prosecuting them. But that's not this minister's approach. This minister's approach is to make the world a less safe place by saying: 'To people who've done something wrong and committed a heinous act, well, we don't care where you go next as long as it's not here. We're going to shut the door. If you go and commit a crime somewhere else, well, you can't blame us.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I again plead with the opposition. This is going to be the first in many of these wedges. If you give in now, it is only going to get worse. This is about democracy. This is about the rule of law. This is about individual liberties and those difficult balancing acts. We cannot support this bill as it stands.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  The policy underlying this bill has largely been developed as a measure to control the return of Australian former Islamic State fighters and supporters from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. I don't think anyone in this chamber disputes that. The bill provides for temporary exclusion orders, or TEOs as they are known, to prevent the return of individuals to Australia without a return permit and for return permits to enable pre-entry and post-entry conditions to be imposed on returning individuals. It provides a mechanism to control the return of individuals who may pose a threat to Australia. We recognise that. It enables the minister to impose conditions on individuals once they have returned to Australia to manage the risk that they may pose to communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance is sympathetic to the intent of the bill. However, it is essential that the legislation includes all of the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security during the previous parliament and that we are thoroughly able to investigate the concerns unearthed through that committee process, and this bill has not done this. The government introduced an earlier version of this bill in the last parliament, and the provisions of that bill were subject to scrutiny through the PJCIS. In their bipartisan report, the committee recommended a number of substantive changes to the legislation. These were sensible, measured recommendations designed to improve the operation of the bill and to provide a modest level of parliamentary oversight, and, as the member for Melbourne said, that does not exist in this bill. It is so alarming that Labor would be keen to wave this through—it just beggars belief. And so the government has decided to pick and choose the recommendations they are willing to implement—recommendations that were supported, as I said, by a bipartisan committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing now is that government, with the opposition, are choosing to give yet more power to the Minister for Home Affairs. That is deeply troubling. Time and time again we are asked to give more powers to the minister and the agencies he oversees while at the same time any attempt at parliamentary scrutiny is rebuffed as being soft on security. That is not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We accept the need for the scheme and we accept it needs to be flexible and responsive to an ever-changing landscape of foreign conflicts, but it is imperative that the legislation includes appropriate safeguards and accountability measures to ensure public confidence in the scheme. Without further scrutiny of this bill, what confidence can any member of parliament, let alone a member of the public, have in the transparent and just application of this scheme? Furthermore, Centre Alliance is calling for the government to release the legal advice that it received, if any, with respect to the constitutionality of this bill. The PJCIS clearly identified a constitutional uncertainty regarding the temporary exclusion of Australian citizens from their own country. The committee strongly recommended that the government obtain legal advice from the Solicitor-General with respect to the constitutional validity of the provisions. We understand that that legal advice has been received, but is it shared with us to make an informed decision here tonight? No. How can I, as the member for Mayo, make an informed decision on this bill when we can't even see the Solicitor-General's advice? How can I or any other member of this chamber be expected to make an informed decision? Again, Labor: please reconsider your position on this. It just flies in the face of everything that you purport to stand for here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of further concern, Arthur Moses SC, President of the Law Council of Australia, has provided legal advice that the proposed legislation is unconstitutional as it is currently drafted. So I call on the minister: please share the government's advice that you received from the Solicitor-General. We want to see it tabled in the parliament. We believe it is a fair and proper ask that you provide it to all members in this chamber. We do not believe that this request is unusual, onerous or without justification. The government's approach to this bill is another glaring example of why we need parliamentary oversight of intelligence agency operations.</span>

                  <a href="282918" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I am thankful to rise to speak in the Parliament of Australia for the first time and for the opportunity to represent the people of Chisholm, who have entrusted me to be their voice in this place. It is a wonderful example of the welcoming character of Australians that my electorate has sent a woman born in Hong Kong to speak for them in the parliament. We are so fortunate to live in a country where migrants can come to Australia, become Australians and serve its people here in the parliament. How good is Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman elected to this place, said in her inaugural speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with the same sense of responsibility that I stand here, more than 75 years later, with respect to Australia's Chinese community. As a migrant, my story is not unlike the story of many others who have come before me or of those who will follow. My parents were not from a well-educated or wealthy background, but they did what they needed to do to provide for their six children. My mother often said if you want something badly you have to work hard to get it. And so I did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was seven, I had to look after my younger siblings. I had to shop, cook, mop the floor, bathe them and take them to see our parents who were running a milk bar 30 kilometres away. I also did deliveries for the business. But don't tell my Dad that I used to take a bar of chocolate without him knowing. When I was a teenager, I worked every summer holiday to fund my education. I also lived with a secret. I discovered that I was deaf in one ear. Having a disability can be a shameful thing in the Asian culture, so I didn't tell anyone. Of course, when I couldn't hear people speaking to me on my left side, I was labelled as snobbish, not cooperative or simply rude. I suffered in silence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only in recent years that I realised that in Australia you don't have to suffer in silence. My hearing did not stop me from playing the trombone with the Hong Kong Youth Symphony Orchestra or learning music at Belilios, the top government girls school in Hong Kong. I want to thank my sister, Connie, for encouraging me to apply for this school. Without going to Belilios I would never have had the opportunity to study speech pathology in Australia; I would never have been awarded a scholarship to study in Melbourne. However, my time as a student, like many international students, came with its own challenges. I arrived in Melbourne with just two suitcases and a determination to succeed. I knew nobody, and nobody knew me. I thought, 'Well, Gladys, if other international students can do this, so can you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While studying at La Trobe University, I did a number of interesting jobs, including being a dressmaker, a waitress and an accident analyst at the Road Traffic Authority. Following my graduation, I took up a position as a speech pathologist at the department of education. I practiced for 14 years in schools around Melbourne, supporting children who struggled with pronunciation, language reception and expression, and stuttering. The fact that I could transform their lives inspired my lifelong passion for helping others to overcome their challenges and to achieve their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the same time, my family opened our first small business. We had a pharmacy in Glen Waverley. If anyone understands the difficulties faced by small-business owners, hand on heart, I can say that I get it; I understand. Small business is tough, but, with dreams to support my family, I persisted. And, if one small business weren't enough, our family went on to open more, including a Chinese restaurant in Box Hill. In the year 2000, I started my own private speech pathology clinic. To my knowledge, it was the first bilingual Chinese-English speech pathology clinic in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with these experiences close to my heart that I have developed my deep understanding and passion for small and family businesses. But this period was also one of the most difficult times in my life. Whilst I embrace my ethnicity and culture, the unfortunate truth is that it is not uncommon for ethnic women to stay with their husbands during unjust situations rather than face the family shame of being a single mother. Social norms told me I was doing the wrong thing, so I didn't tell anyone, including my parents and siblings, until years later when they came to visit me in Australia. Once again, I felt that I had no choice but to suffer in silence. It was my children who gave me strength to do what was right by them, and they gave me a purpose: to keep being a good mother. I am so proud of my two wonderful children. I persisted through the tough times in the hope that they too would be proud of me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of overcoming the obstacles I have faced in my journey to this place and I am proud of all Australians who do not give up hope in difficult times. In the last 20 years, my own experiences have motivated me to help others who were suffering in silence, who were less fortunate and who simply needed help. This is why I have been actively helping people, including many strangers. This is why I was the founder and president of the Shero Association for victims of domestic violence, and this is why I'm proud to see headspace coming to Monash. My experiences have also motivated me to seek public office so that I can be in a better place to provide that help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first taste of politics actually came through tai chi, of all places. I was encouraged to join the committee. From there it wasn't long before I was asked to join the Chinese Professional and Business Association, where I organised a seminar named Path to Politics. That's when my journey to this place really started to take shape. I didn't really know much about party politics. I could have chosen either of the major parties, but it was always going to be the Liberal Party where I found my political home. Chinese migrants naturally share many of the values of the Liberal Party, including an affinity for hard work, individual responsibility, achievement in education and business, family values, and respect for the rules of society. I will continue to champion these values which are based around giving Australian families the opportunity to flourish like mine has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chisholm is a place where migrants have settled to seek new opportunities and prosperity. It is fitting that an electorate named after Caroline Chisholm, who was best known for assisting migrants, now has not only a member of parliament who was born overseas but also more than half of its residents born overseas. Chisholm is well known for its vibrant Chinese community, but there are also sizeable and active communities from Greece, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, as well as Italy, South Korea and many others. It is only natural that our parliament reflects the make-up of our brilliant and diverse society. If I'm able to play a small part in creating a clearer reflection and if I'm able to help build mutual respect among all people then I stand proudly ready to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of parliament I hope that my heritage and experience can contribute to a long and healthy relationship between Australia and China. Australia and China have much to gain from a robust economic and cultural exchange. I will look to support future opportunities for collaboration and cooperation, and for an enduring and constructive relationship in Australia's interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Chisholm, as a mother of two children and as a qualified speech pathologist, I maintain a keen interest in education and particularly in the local schools. It is no accident that my first official engagement as the local member was to visit Ashwood High School, and I look forward to visiting all of the other 57 schools in Chisholm soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a passion for improving access to local sport. Sport is a great vehicle that can bring communities together across cultural and economic boundaries. I want to work with our many sporting and community groups to help make Chisholm a more vibrant place to live. That's why we are investing in facilities for the Box Hill Rugby Union Football Club, Box Hill Tennis Club, Blackburn Football Club and many more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chisholm is a tapestry of established suburbs, commercial areas and bustling retail centres. There is so much aspiration in Chisholm. I hear that aspiration when I shop at Box Hill Central, where I meet with local businesses, workers and families. Our job in this place is to make sure that we deliver on the promise of the Prime Minister that, if you have a go, you'll get a go. That's why I was proud that, with my first vote in this House, I was able to deliver a tax cut for hardworking Australians, including 71,469 taxpayers in Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not underestimate the enormity of being the first Chinese-born member of this place. I know some people will see everything I do through the lens of my birthplace, but I hope that they will see more than just the first Chinese woman elected to this place. I hope they will see me as a strong advocate for everyone in Chisholm. Chisholm is where my heart is. I have lived in and around Chisholm for the past thirty years. As I sit in my electorate office in Burwood and look out the window, I see the girls on the school oval and think that this is where my daughter used to play not that long ago. I have run businesses in Chisholm, I have raised my family in Chisholm and I have volunteered with local clubs like Box Hill Little Athletics and the Box Hill Chess Club, an organisation for which I served as the first and only female president. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the work of all the people who have contributed in some way to making my electorate of Chisholm a better place, including my predecessor Julia Banks. My journey to this place has been long and uncertain, and I want to thank those who put their confidence in me and made it possible for me to become the member for Chisholm. I have had incredible support from my friends, mentors and supporters in the Liberal Party over many years. I have been a humble campaign volunteer, a branch president, a member of the administrative committee and an adviser to two Victorian Premiers, and I am now the member for Chisholm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to Ted Baillieu, who brought me into his office when he was the opposition leader and who I was proud to work closely with when he became the Premier of Victoria. Ted has been a genuine friend and a trusted source of guidance ever since. Thank you to Noel Pink, the chairman of the Chisholm FEC; Inga Peulich, my campaign director; and Robert Clark, a long-term friend and current president of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  The government will not be accepting the opposition's proposed amendment. The government accepted 17 of the committee's 19 recommendations and noted the remaining two. The two noted recommendations were not accepted in full because to do so would weaken and undermine the TEO scheme and increase risks of terrorism to the community. Of the two noted recommendations, recommendation 11 proposed that the threshold criminal liability for a breach of an offence provision in the bill should be 'knowledge of'. This threshold is above the criminal law standard of recklessness, and it would, in effect, make the prosecution of offences under the act almost impossible. Amending these offences to be based on knowledge rather than recklessness would therefore reduce the deterrent effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, recommendation 12 proposed that a TEO can only be made if the minister reasonably suspects that the person is or has been involved in terrorism related activities outside Australia. Requiring the minister to suspect the person is or has been involved in terrorism related activities is a high threshold to achieve. In many cases, the specific conduct of a person's interest in terrorism offshore is unclear. In other cases, agencies may simply not yet have undertaken an assessment of the person before they seek to travel to Australia. Given that the fundamental purpose of the TEO scheme is to ensure that agencies have sufficient time to assess the potential risk of a person of terrorism interest before that person returns to Australia, the bill facilitates this by providing that the minister may make a TEO in one of two circumstances. Firstly, the TEO can be made by the minister to assist in preventing terrorism related acts from occurring. Secondly, the minister may make a TEO where the person has been assessed by ASIO to be a direct or indirect risk to security for reasons related to politically motivated violence. The government has carefully considered the committee's recommendations and believes it has achieved an appropriate balance. As I stated, for this reason the government will not be supporting the amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments to the temporary exclusion orders bill ensure that the bill conforms to the unanimous and bipartisan recommendations of Labor and government members of the Intelligence and Security Committee—no more, no less. It is extremely disappointing that the Minister for Home Affairs has come into this House and continued with his false assertion that the government is agreeing to all but two of the committee's 19 recommendations. In fact, there are 10, or possibly 11, of the unanimous recommendations of the committee that have not been agreed to by the government. And it is also disappointing that the minister asserted just a moment ago that, if the government were to agree to the amendments recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, it would somehow increase the risk of terrorism in the community. He hasn't explained that assertion. It is a baseless assertion. It is not one we heard from the intelligence agencies or the Australian Federal Police during the course of the hearings of the intelligence committee.</span>

It's disappointing, indeed, that we haven't seen the member for Canning, the chair of the committee, even attempt to defend the unanimous recommendations that the committee he chaired made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first recommendation goes to recommendation 1, and amendment (10) relates to that. That first recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require the minister, before making a temporary exclusion order that requires the person to surrender their Australian passport or to be prevented from applying for obtaining a new Australian passport, to have regard, to the extent that that information is available, to (1) whether the person has a lawful ability to stay in their current location for the duration of the order; (2) whether the person has a lawful ability to enter a third country—for example, due to holding a passport or residency visa for that third country—and (3) the likelihood of the person being detained, mistreated or harmed if the person has no lawful ability to stay in their current location and no lawful ability to enter a third country for the duration of the order.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that it has implemented this recommendation, but that is not proved. The purpose of the recommendation is absolutely clear. It's self-explanatory. You'd think the government would have instantly embraced this recommendation—which, like all the other recommendations made by the committee, is a practical recommendation, one which makes the bill more workable. The government's amendments say that the minister should consider those matters before imposing a condition on a return permit. The committee's specific recommendation was that the matters I've just gone through have to be considered before the minister imposes a temporary exclusion order.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Was this a mistake? Is there some reason the government says those matters shouldn't be considered before the minister issues a temporary exclusion order? Does the government even understand the difference between a return permit and a temporary exclusion order? We don't know the answer to those questions. Instead of engaging with Labor, instead of engaging with the parliament, instead of doing this in a public and appropriate manner, the government has falsely claimed that it has implemented the first recommendation of the committee. That is, in a very literal sense, not true. Amendment (10) would implement the committee's recommendation as it was made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 is dealt with in amendment (25). The second recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require the minister to give a return permit to a person as soon as practicable upon receipt of an application or when a person is to be deported to Australia. The bill as presented to the parliament amends the previous version of the bill so that the minister is only required to give a return permit within a reasonable period. 'As soon as practicable' is not the same test— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  as 'within a reasonable period'. We saw earlier this week the Minister for Home Affairs—this same Minister for Home Affairs—table a report on the retention of metadata by agencies between July 2016 and June 2017. Presumably this minister believes that tabling a report two years late is within a reasonable period. Labor does not. That's why not only did the Labor members but also the government members of the Intelligence and Security Committee unanimously recommend that the appropriate amendment to be made to this legislation was to require that a return permit be given as soon as practicable upon receipt of an application. So, amendment (25) that's before the House implements the committee's second recommendation by requiring the minister to give a return permit as soon as practicable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come now to recommendations 3 and 12 made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. They're dealt with in amendment (10). The third and 12th recommendations of the committee would have seen the bill amended to prevent the making of a temporary exclusion order unless the decision-maker reasonably suspects that the person is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities outside Australia and making the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, a terrorist act. Recommendation 12 as made by the committee would have also prevented the minister from acting as nothing more than a rubber stamp for security assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These recommendations were rejected. They have been rejected by the government, and the particular rejection is very telling. Over the last several days, in talking about this bill, the government has said that the targets of this bill are people who have been fighting with groups like the Islamic State group in Syria. But that directly contradicts what the minister's own department, the Department of Home Affairs, told the intelligence committee in public hearings. The department told the committee in the public hearings that any person who is known to have engaged in active fighting in conflict zones in Syria or Iraq or both would not be subject to a temporary exclusion order. Such a person would be allowed to come back to Australia, arrested at the airport, charged, put on trial and held in jail in the meantime while that trial was pending. The government has to be honest and straightforward about what this bill actually does and the problem that it's actually seeking to address. The rejection of this particular proposed amendment—the recommended amendment by the committee—illustrates the fact that, to date, the government has not been open, honest and straightforward about these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the second part of these recommendations, which would have prevented the minister from acting as a rubber stamp, we know this Minister for Home Affairs is lazy. We also know that when he's required to make a decision under an act of parliament he often gets the decision wrong. The host of cases under the Migration Act where this minister's decisions have been set aside by a tribunal or by a court is evidence of that. The Intelligence and Security Committee quite sensibly proposed an amendment that would actually require the minister to turn his mind to the task of issuing an exclusion order. We can understand why this lazy and incompetent Minister for Home Affairs would not like that part of recommendation 12, but the fact that his colleagues would agree to back his position, which is to ignore the recommendations of the Intelligence and Security Committee to give him a licence to not do his job, is disappointing to say the least.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />There's something else about recommendation 12 that I need to mention. The government has repeatedly said that this legislation is based on, and follows, the United Kingdom's law for temporary exclusion orders that the United Kingdom parliament managed to pass in 2015, some four years ago. If ever we wanted better proof of the incompetence of this government in taking four years to bring this legislation to the parliament, it is that they cannot even understand the basis for their own legislation. In relation to this matter, it does not follow the model that has been provided to us by the United Kingdom parliament, in that their legislation directs itself and directs the attention of the issuing authority to whether or not a particular proposed subject for a temporary exclusion order had, in fact, been involved in terrorism activities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  The fourth recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill so that, in determining the best interests of a child before issuing a temporary exclusion order, the minister would have to take into account the child's age, maturity, sex, background, physical and mental health, the right to receive an education and other matters. The government's amendments would allow the minister to be wilfully blind to those matters because they would allow the minister to say, 'Those matters are not relevant.' But the committee's recommendation was that those matters are relevant—that it should not be for the minister to decide whether or not those matters are relevant but, rather, that the act should so provide. Amendment 26 addresses this issue and would implement recommendation 4 in full.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to recommendation 5. This fifth recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require a temporary exclusion order to set out, first, that the issuing authority is satisfied of the matters mentioned in section 10; second, a summary of the grounds on which the order is made, excluding information that's likely to prejudice national security; and third, the person's rights of review in relation to the order and any return permit that is made. Again, this recommendation was not implemented by the government in the bill that's been brought to the parliament. The bill does not require the temporary exclusion order to state the grounds on which the order is made, so someone who's given an exclusion order would not even know why, nor does it require the order to set out the person's right to review. Amendment (12) in the set before the House would implement this recommendation in full.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I digress to remind the House of the extreme nature of the power with which we are presently dealing. It is a power which Labor accepts should be part of the discretionary armoury, if I can put it like that, available to the government of Australia and its agencies in order to manage the return to Australia of Australians who have been engaged in terrorism activity overseas and who potentially pose some risk to the Australian community. Managing their return is an appropriate matter, but the power is such an extreme one. We can see that the extreme nature of the power has given rise to very serious doubts about the constitutionality of the power, as raised by people as eminent as Mr Arthur Moses SC, the president of the Law Council, and Professor Helen Irving from the University of Sydney. The government is clearly not even going to engage with that at all, because it's not providing to this parliament any evidence of the constitutionality of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extreme power with which we are dealing. The committee's recommendations go to making the exercise of the power appropriately subject to safeguards. They go to making the exercise of the power more workable. Had the government accepted the recommendations that the committee made, it would have put in place some matters which to me and I think any fair-minded person would seem absolutely self-evident: that an Australian citizen who has been kept from returning to their country—because that is what this power is about—should know why the exclusion order has been made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to recommendation 7; that's the subject of very many of the amendments that are in the set—(10), (14), (17), (20), (22), (28) and (30). This seventh recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require a temporary exclusion order, in effect, so that a temporary exclusion order may only be issued by an issuing authority, such as a retired judge, and that an issuing authority must approve conditions in a return permit. Again, this would have brought the bill more in line with the UK legislation, which the government claimed, falsely, their bill is based on. Members opposite—including some of the members opposite who participated in the making of the recommendation, namely the member for Berowra and the member for Canning, the chair of the committee—have sought to mischaracterise this recommendation as being a recommendation about judicial review. They have then falsely claimed that the government has implemented it in principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, not to get too lawyerly about it, a retired judge is not a member of the judiciary. The clue is in the word retired. The reviewing authority would in fact be a member of the executive. Secondly, the government's bill does not create an issuing authority but would instead create a reviewing authority with extremely limited powers of review. Such an authority would not serve as a check on the power of the minister at all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  To make it worse, the government's amendments give rise to an additional ground of constitutional invalidity. This is a change that the government is itself making between the bill in the form in which it was brought to this place in February and the bill in the form in which it now takes and is before the parliament. That the bill has changed gives rise to an additional ground of constitutional invalidity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the Law Council and from others that the bill is at serious risk of being unconstitutional because it infringes the constitutional right of abode. In its half-baked and sloppy attempt to implement recommendation 7 'in principle'—because that's the government claim—the government has created an additional constitutional problem because, in one view, the 'reviewing authority', who would be a member of the executive, is purporting to exercise powers that the Constitution vests exclusively in the judiciary. That contravenes the separation of powers, a fundamental principle that this Minister for Home Affairs seems to have little time for. Most of Labor's amendments go to addressing this recommendation—for instance, replacing every use of the words 'reviewing authority' with the words 'issuing authority'. Some of the key substantive amendments that go to this recommendation are amendments (10), (14), (17), (20), (22), (28) and (30).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To implement another part of recommendation 7, amendment (21) would allow the minister to issue an interim temporary exclusion order in urgent circumstances. In those cases, the minister would then have to obtain the approval of the issuing authority as soon as practicable. Again, this was simply a practical suggestion that the committee had put forward and that the government, without explanation, is rejecting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 10 was a very simple recommendation. The committee recommended that the bill be amended to clarify that a person may seek judicial review of a decision of the minister to grant or refuse an application for a return permit. Incredibly, this was rejected by the government on the ground that it was unnecessary. The government has argued it's unnecessary to expressly provide for judicial review in these circumstances by pointing to the fact that a minister must accept an application for a return permit, but again that is not true. Under the bill as presented to this parliament, the minister must give a return permit if a person has applied to the minister in the prescribed form and manner, or the person is to be or is being deported to Australia. Implicitly, the minister may refuse to give a return permit if he does not believe the person has applied in an appropriate manner, and the minister may or may not be correct about that. Amendment (24) makes it clear that there are judicial review rights in relation to a decision to grant or refuse an application for a return. This is pretty basic stuff. As with all of the PJCIS recommendations, it would make the bill clearer and more workable, and the government's rejection of this one is inexplicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to recommendation 11. The committee's 11th recommendation would see the bill amended so that, in any prosecution for a breach of an offence provision under the bill, the prosecution must prove that the defendant had knowledge of the existence of the temporary exclusion order or of the relevant return permit condition, as applicable. As a general principle—and I would hope that every single member of this place would absolutely subscribe to this general principle—people should not be prosecuted for breaching an order they are unaware of, especially in circumstances where such an order can be issued on the basis of the minister's belief or satisfaction of certain matters and breach of the order can result in a prison sentence. The government has entirely failed to present a coherent argument as to why that general principle—which, I say again, I would sincerely hope every member of the parliament would agree to—should not be adhered to in these circumstances. While it's true that a person may not be aware of an exclusion order at the time it's issued, because, for example, the person's in a remote location or the government doesn't know where the person is, any such person who tries to return to Australia would presumably be made aware of the order when he or she tries to board a plane, for example. Is the government really saying that a person who is subject to one of these temporary exclusion orders would not be flagged on an airline's computer system? The government has to explain why, in a practical sense, requiring the prosecution to prove actual knowledge of the existence of the order is unworkable; it is not enough just to assert it. That's what the government did in its submission to the Intelligence and Security Committee, and no member of that bipartisan committee, Labor or Liberal, was convinced. That's why the committee unanimously made recommendation 11, which the government is rejecting. Amendment (31) would implement that recommendation of the committee. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with the other recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, recommendation 16 of the committee was a unanimous recommendation made by all six of the Liberal members of the committee and the five Labor members of the committee. Recommendation 16 is to the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 rather than to the substantive bill because it relates to a particular aspect of the interaction between the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the new powers that have been conferred by this legislation. What recommendation 16 of the committee was directed at was enabling the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to provide a copy of the reports made by the monitor at the same time as the reports are provided to the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also recommended that the monitor should be empowered to brief the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on his or her findings. Honourable members will bear in mind that the national security legislation monitor is the very agency that this government was committed to abolishing when it came to office in 2013. It was only after a number of the crossbenchers in the Senate were persuaded of the worth of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, an agency created by the previous Labor government, that the then Abbott government was prevented from abolishing it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen over the course of successive years, since this government tried to abolish the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the worth of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. It's a very useful reviewing mechanism. It's a very useful safeguard. It's a very useful level of scrutiny that's provided. All three of the national security legislation monitors to date have been very senior barristers, the first being Bret Walker SC; the second being Roger Gyles AO, a former judge of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales; and the third eminent barrister, occupying the position as we speak, being James Renwick SC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This recommendation went directly to the oversight of the use of these new temporary exclusion orders, or the new powers, that would be created by this legislation. The oversight of these new powers would be via the parliament through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The government has not accepted this recommendation. That's an extraordinary non-acceptance. Again, as with a whole range of the recommendations that were made by the committee in respect of the substantive bill, the government—neither through the Prime Minister nor through this Minister for Home Affairs—has not sought to explain the failure of the government to accept the unanimous recommendations of the committee, which is chaired by the member for Canning, a Liberal member of parliament, and on which there is a majority of Liberal members—six out of 11.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly surprising in the case of recommendation 16 that the government has chosen not to accept it. Recommendation 16 is consistent with recommendation 23, paragraph 2 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Independent intelligence review</span>, which was conducted by Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant. That's a regular review. They take place roughly five or seven years apart. The <span style="font-style:italic;">2017</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Independent intelligence review</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>was, as I said, conducted by very senior former public servants, Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Which was so that the committee could:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… request a briefing from the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor … to ask the Monitor to provide the PJCIS with a report on matters referred by the PJCIS, and for the Monitor to provide the PJCIS with the outcome of the Monitor's inquiries into existing legislation at the same time as the Monitor provides such reports to the responsible Minister …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government doesn't like safeguards. This government doesn't like scrutiny. This government doesn't like any independent bodies being involved in reviewing any of its actions. That's presumably why the government is not acting on this recommendation either, as it didn't act on the other recommendations of the Intelligence and Security Committee to which I've already referred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is really surprising is that, when the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017 Independent </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntelligence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview</span> was released to the public, the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as he stood next to the minister who is now the Minister for Home Affairs, said that the government had accepted the recommendations of the review. Now, two years on, in rejecting another part of the recommendations, the government says it's still considering the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017 Independent i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntelligence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview</span>. So what's changed? Maybe what's changed is that Prime Minister Turnbull got the sack in a coup led by the present Minister for Home Affairs. Maybe that's the reason why the same government, having said that it accepted the recommendations of the national intelligence review, is now saying it doesn't, because it's still considering it. Maybe that's what changed. I would suggest to this parliament that, almost two years after the public release of the independent national intelligence review, in 2017, it's time for the Minister for Home Affairs to stop pretending to consider things and start doing his job. Yesterday we saw the extraordinary delay that the minister engaged in to release, some two years late, the statistics on the metadata scheme. Let's hope that we don't have to wait another two years for the already completed stats for the next year of the metadata scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is an amendment that would fully implement the very sensible, very modest and unanimously agreed 16th recommendation of the Intelligence and Security Committee. It is an amendment which would, in accordance with the recommendation of the committee, allow the committee to do the job that the parliament set it up to do, to do the job that the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Independent </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntelligence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview</span> said that it should do and said should be expanded to enable the committee to engage with new powers when new powers are conferred on the government or the government's agencies—that is, that there be adequate scrutiny of new powers when they're created, that there be adequate scrutiny by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, and that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security should be able to interact with that other scrutiny process. It's a scrutiny process that has already proved its worth. It's a scrutiny process that we've seen since the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was created in 2010. It's in the form of annual reports by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and in the form of briefings provided by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor—all three of them—to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. It's a process that has improved the visibility of the use of powers. It has improved public confidence in the use of those powers—many of them extreme powers that have been given to agencies. Public confidence is a very, very important aspect of any national security regime. This government doesn't appear to care at all about building public confidence. Building public confidence in the work done by our agencies to keep us safe and building public confidence in the way extreme powers are often used, and often in secret, is a very important part of any national security system in what should be an open and participatory democracy such as our own.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To have this government reject a perfectly simple recommendation, unanimously made by Liberal and Labor members of the committee, without explanation is absolutely symptomatic of the inadequate and incompetent approach this government has taken to the presentation of this bill to the parliament. Not content with waiting some 3½ years past the time that the United Kingdom parliament had provided a model of this kind of power in the form of their temporary exclusion orders legislation, not content with waiting until late last year, in late 2018—presumably because the Minister for Home Affairs was too busy knocking off the sitting Prime Minister—to even announce that the government was going to do something, the government had us wait until February of this year for it to introduce the previous form of the bill. At that time the government said it was a matter that the Intelligence and Secuirty Committee should consider urgently. The committee did consider it urgently. It reported to the parliament shortly before the election was called, and in its report made some 19 recommendations, which the government, regrettably, is now self-evidently—because of the position taken by this Minister for Home Affairs in coming into the parliament—thumbing its nose at. That's the only way in which it can be put.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has failed to explain why it is not giving effect to some 10 or 11 recommendations of the committee. The government is not even showing the respect this parliament deserves, let alone the respect the Australian community deserves. When we've had a process, when the process has been conducted urgently by the Intelligence and Security Committee, when there are sensible, practical recommendations that you've only got to read to see how sensible and practical they are, and when you've got recommendations that will improve the working of the legislation, that will make Australians safer, that will build public confidence in the operation of these new powers, it's incredibly disappointing to see the attitude that has been adopted by the Prime Minister and by this Minister for Home Affairs, who seem to think—on this occasion as, regrettably, on so many other occasions—that national security is their plaything, that national security is something they can use to score cheap political points, that national security is something they can bring to this parliament to, in their words, 'set up a test for Labor'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, enough of that. Enough of this setting up a test for Labor. We call on the government to legislate and to use the processes of this parliament for the national interest of this country. We call on this government to actually consider the national interest and to stop its pathetic political rhetoric of 'this legislation sets a test for Labor'. Before you get to say that, you've actually got to explain what the bill's for. Before you get to say that, you've actually got to explain why you're choosing to ignore the unanimous recommendations of a bipartisan committee. Before you get to say that, you have to actually explain why the legislation is needed. This incompetent Minister for Home Affairs has done none of those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to agree to this amendment to the consequential amendments bill that is now before the House. It's your last opportunity to do the right thing. Again, it's disappointing that the chair of the committee, the member for Canning, hasn't seen fit to back in the recommendations that he agreed to in April and that the member for Berowra or the member for La Trobe haven't seen fit to come into this place and back in the recommendations they agreed to. It's another opportunity the government should take to agree to this amendment.</span>

                    <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  I rise to say thank you to all those honourable members who have contributed to this debate. This is a very important debate. I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Isaacs. Nobody who reads the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>of this debate will truly appreciate how much the member for Isaacs enjoys the sound of his own voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the claims he has made are completely spurious and factually incorrect. Sadly for the Labor Party, for a long period of time, they have used the PJCIS as a management tool for the member of Isaacs. It is an opportunity for Labor to try and move him from the caucus, where it must be painful for any attendee to listen to his regular bombastic contributions. The fact is that that will no longer be tolerated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is operating in the national interest when it comes to national security matters. We are not going to have our bills that are important to keep Australians safe watered down by this individual. That's what might have happened in the past—and perhaps the member for Maribyrnong used that as an opportunity to try and keep this member for Isaacs in check—but this government will not tolerate it. We are going to work with the committee. We will look at the recommendations made by the committee in relation to the relevant legislation that they might explore, and we will ultimately decide, in our country's interests, in an attempt to keep Australians safe, which of those recommendations we accept.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the government has been elected on a mandate to provide legislation to this parliament to protect Australians from a very real threat. We know that, since 2012, around 230 Australians have travelled to Syria or Iraq to fight in the name of ISIL. Though many have died in their attempts, many of those who survived intend to return to our country. Indeed, the advice of our national security agencies is that, following the recent collapse of Islamic State's territorial control in Syria and Iraq, many of these people will be seeking to return to Australia in the very near future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The threat that is beyond our shores, as we know, is also here in Australia. In fact, since September 2014, when the national terrorism threat level was raised, our police and security agencies have thwarted 16 attempted attacks on our own soil. Tragically, seven were not thwarted, and innocent people going about their daily lives were killed and injured. There are now around 50 offenders now in Australian prisons serving sentences for terrorism related offences. It's against this backdrop that the government has introduced this bill and advocates for its passage in order to keep Australian communities safe from those who seek to do us harm. That will continue to be this government's No. 1 priority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to putting in place all measures necessary to ensure the safety of Australians. We must do all we can to protect our communities from persons whose intent is to cause death and/or destruction of the most heinous kind. I'm confident that I speak for members on both sides—or the vast majority of members on both sides of this chamber—when I say that we will never hesitate to stand up for Australians and we will never soften our stance against terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill recognises and responds to the significantly increased risk that Australia now faces from returning foreign fighters. The TEO scheme, which the bill establishes, will ensure that, if an Australian of counterterrorism interest does seek to return to Australia, it will be with adequate forewarning and into the hands of authorities. The TEO scheme will ensure that agencies have sufficient time to assess the potential risk of an Australian citizen of counterterrorism interest before that person returns to Australia. The TEO scheme will also assist our national security and law enforcement agencies to monitor such individuals when they do ultimately return to Australia. Put simply, the TEO scheme is designed to ensure that authorities can manage those returns in a way that keeps the Australian community safe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister may make a TEO that prohibits an Australian of counterterrorism interest from entering Australia for up to two years, except with a return permit. The minister must issue a return permit within a reasonable period if a person applies or if a person is being deported or extradited to Australia. The return permit may contain conditions such as specifying when and how the person must enter Australia. It may also specify conditions which the person must comply with once in Australia, such as requiring the person to give notice of where they live or where they work. A return permit remains in force for up to 12 months after the person's re-entry into Australia. It will be an offence punishable by up to two years imprisonment for a person to return to Australia in breach of a TEO or return permit or to fail to comply with conditions of a return permit. The bill contains a range of appropriate safeguards. The government has been mindful in developing the bill to ensure that it appropriately addresses the needs to protect the community from foreign fighters while ensuring oversight and accountability on the TEO decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation is the product of careful consideration. It is based on the advice of our security agencies and the Solicitor-General and is modelled on the UK's TEO scheme. The legislation has been reviewed by the committee and the committee's recommendations have been substantially incorporated into the bill. All TEOs will be subject to review by an independent reviewer and that person, or that authority, is either a former judge or a serving senior AAT member. Conditions imposed under a return permit will be tailored to the individual in accordance with the risk they pose to the community. Special safeguards apply to persons aged 14 to 17.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for its recommendations. As I say, the bill substantially reflects the recommendations of the PJCIS, including to provide four significant additional safeguards and independent oversight. I also thank the colleagues across both sides of the chamber for recognising the need for these important measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the member for Isaacs, the Labor Party representative in this debate, has moved 41 amendments to this bill, has claimed it to be unconstitutional and has opposed this bill at every step, right up until the eleventh hour to the point where the member for Isaacs realised—or I suspect the Leader of the Opposition realised—that there was support from the crossbench in the Senate for this bill to secure passage. All of a sudden, the member for Isaacs decided to support this bill. Let's not be in any doubt about what has happened here. Begrudgingly, I suspect under stern instruction from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Isaacs has moved his 40 amendments but ultimately is required to support this bill.</span>

The bill sets the terms by which Australians of counterterrorism interest return to Australia, gives authority over when and how they enter Australia and provides checks on them when they are here. The Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, complements the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 by introducing additional accountability and transparency measures for the temporary exclusion order scheme in response to the recommendations made by the PJCIS. Specifically, it provides that it is a function of the committee to monitor and review the exercise of power under the scheme and to review the operation and effectiveness of the scheme within three years of its commencement. The bill also enables the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the scheme. The passage of that bill will assist in ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between those critical measures needed to protect the Australian community and the safeguards and accountability measures necessary to ensure public confidence in the TEO scheme.</span>

This bill seeks to repeal the medevac legislation that was passed by the parliament in February this year. It also seeks to amend the Migration Act to extend existing powers in relation to persons transferred to Australia under the medical transfer provisions, allowing for their removal from Australia or return to a regional processing country once they no longer need to be in Australia for the temporary purpose for which they were brought here.</span>

In Labor, we have always had two objectives with respect to the medical transfer of vulnerable people from PNG and Nauru: firstly, to ensure that sick people get the medical care they need, as determined by medical advice; and, secondly, to ensure that the minister has final discretion over medical transfers on national security, public safety or character grounds. Labor's objectives have not changed, nor have the grounds that caused us to support the medevac legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In introducing the bill, the minister made quite an extraordinary speech, but extraordinary for all the wrong reasons. Though short, it managed to pack in an outrageous series of allegations, undiluted by facts or any sense of responsibility to the people who are directly the subject of this debate or to the Australian people. The minister said there was never a need for Labor's law in introducing this attempt to repeal the much needed amendments to the Migration Act passed at the end of the last parliament. I wish he was right. I wish this parliament had no need to make a law that makes it clear to the government that Australians want people, ultimately in our care, to get the medical care they need, medical care as determined by medical professionals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It still saddens me that we needed to make that law. But it angers me that the Morrison government and this minister are still using sick and vulnerable people as their political playthings. On more than 50 occasions medical transfers occurred prior to the passage of the medevac legislation, following litigation. As I understand it, as I am informed, every case that commenced resulted in a transfer to Australia, either by court order or through the concession of this government. Is this really how government members want this question of medical treatment to be addressed, through the courts? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, what the medevac bill, the regime presently in place, does, sensibly and clearly, following compromise in this place, is to codify something that was already happening and to ensure our objectives, both of them, are met. This is so that we can ensure treatment can be received in a timely fashion and that questions of security, safety and character can also be addressed. If the government were seriously concerned about the operation of medical transfers they would have proposed amendments to deal with their concerns. But the facts demonstrate that medevac is working, and no amendments have been proposed. It's simply wrong to play politics with the lives of sick and vulnerable people in our care, and it's a nonsense and an abdication of responsibility to return to the situation prior to the enactment of the medevac bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly share with the House the human story I think best illustrates what a difference this regime has made and how dangerous it would be to go back. The story concerns a two-year-old girl known as DIZ18. Her parents fled Iran to Australia, arriving in 2013 without a visa. They were taken by the Australian government to Nauru and recognised as refugees under the refugee convention in 2014. DIZ18 was born in Nauru on 5 June 2016. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This little girl became ill in June 2018 and her illness rapidly got worse over the next few days. On 12 June the treating doctors, with the International Health and Medical Services—the medical service contracted to provide health care to refugees on Nauru—diagnosed her with severe sepsis. In short, IHMS recommended that the little girl be urgently medically evacuated, to a tertiary level hospital, to Australia or a third country. A senior officer of the Australian Border Force involved in the decision then inquired whether it was possible for the applicant to, instead, be evacuated to a hospital in PNG or Taiwan. Each doctor and specialist who recommended her medical evacuation recommended that she be taken to a tertiary hospital in Australia or another First World country; however, the sick little girl was treated at the hospital in Papua New Guinea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It rapidly became clear that the standard of care required, including MRI brain scans and other scans, was not available at this hospital. Justice Murphy, presiding over the case, stated, 'There is a strongly arguable case that in evacuating the applicant to PIH rather than to a hospital in Australia, the respondents provided inadequate medical care to the applicant. The evacuation resulted in the applicant being sent to a hospital which, at least arguably, did not have the capacity to properly respond to her medical needs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case of this little girl demonstrates that decisions about medical care should be taken by medical professionals. The advice of doctors should be listened to and acted upon. The Australian people are good, decent and generous. They don't want to see vulnerable, sick people in our care suffering when medical care is available to treat them. They appreciate that these circumstances are distinct from the complex policy debates in this area. This is why the parliament must not allow the medevac legislation to be repealed. This is why we are proposing our second reading amendment to the bill, which is before the House. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to remember that the medevac regime only applies to those refugees and asylum seekers in PNG and Nauru at royal assent on Friday, 1 March 2019. For the medevac process to be enlivened, two or more treating doctors for a patient in PNG or Nauru must advise the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs that the patient needs to be brought to Australia for medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment. The minister can approve or deny the transfer on national security, public safety or character grounds if the patient has a substantial criminal record as defined under section 501(7) of the Migration Act and believes the transfer would expose the Australian community to serious risk of criminal conduct, or the minister suspects the transfer of a person to Australia would be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the ASIO Act, including because of an adverse security assessment, or ASIO advises the minister that the transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security and that threat cannot be mitigated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister denies the transfer on national security, public safety or character grounds, that is the end of the matter. I repeat: that is the end of the matter. In these circumstances, the transfer does not occur. If the minister denies the transfer on health grounds only, then the following must occur: the minister must inform the Independent Health Advice Panel as soon as practicable, and, within 72 hours, the panel must conduct a further clinical assessment and inform the minister that the minister's decision to deny on health grounds is confirmed or that the transfer has been approved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government has approved approximately 90 transfers and that 20 cases have been referred to this panel. Of the 20 referred to the panel, the panel has upheld the minister's decision not to transfer the individual on 13 occasions and overturned the minister's decision not to transfer in seven cases. Let us remember that these are decisions made by an independent panel of doctors that the minister got to choose himself. The panel includes some of Australia's best doctors, including the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the Surgeon General of the Australian Border Force. Despite this, the minister has been vigorously arguing that 'two doctors from Nimbin' can force the government to bring people from Manus or Nauru to Australia, which is just ridiculous. Ultimately, I think the numbers demonstrate both the need for medevac—that it is helping vulnerable people get the care they need, based on advice—and also an effective safeguard in place that enables ministerial discretion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of what you think about the wider debates about asylum policy, Australia can and should show humanity. We should not fail to provide critically ill people in our care—in particular, children—with urgent medical treatment. That was the rationale behind the medevac bill—the Migration Amendment (Urgent Medical Treatment) Bill 2018 introduced by the former member for Wentworth, Dr Kerryn Phelps, and the member for Clark. It was one that Labor supported. Medevac is modest and necessary, and, importantly, it is working. I note that there are presently no government members listed to speak in this debate, and perhaps that's as eloquent a testimony to its effectiveness as anything else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important to note that there is very strong support for the retention of the existing legislation and its framework among stakeholders, including the AMA, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Law Council and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. Medecins sans Frontieres, or Doctors without Borders, provided mental health care on Nauru for 11 months up until late last year, and their report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Indefinite Despair</span>, released in December of last year, makes extremely difficult reading. The report states that, of the 208 refugees and asylum seekers the organisation treated in Nauru, 124 patients—that's 60 per cent—had suicidal thoughts and 63 patients—that's nearly one in three—attempted suicide. Children as young as nine years of age were found to have had suicidal thoughts, committed self-harm or attempted suicide. Let us think about that—all of us who have the capacity to help these people or not to. Their report goes on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that, if the government had legitimate proposals to improve the operation of the medevac regime, the Minister for Home Affairs would have put forward amendments rather than simply seeking to repeal the legislation while saying very little about it. He would enter into a good-faith discussion, setting out his concerns and how he would propose that they be addressed. But Minister Dutton has not sought to amend medevac. Rather, what he wants to do is to have us revert to a flawed medical transfer regime that was failing to provide adequate and timely medical care to refugees and asylum seekers in regional processing countries. This once again comes down to Minister Dutton—his mismanagement and his incompetence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The medevac expert panel that the home affairs minister claimed would open the floodgates and admit sick refugees and asylum seekers to Australia has only been used a few times since the law passed—20 times—with the overwhelming majority of all medevac applications being waved through by the government before reaching the final medical body. Indeed, since the laws were enacted, only seven patients have been transferred without the approval of Minister Dutton or Minister Coleman, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs—seven people. Importantly—and this is a really critical point in the debate, and it really exposes the position of the minister and his government—the ministers did not reject any cases due to security or character concerns; the rejections were due to contested medical grounds. Then these people were only transferred to Australia after being assessed by an expert panel of doctors that the minister got to choose. Remember, this panel includes some of Australia's best doctors, as I mentioned before—the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the Surgeon General of the Australian Border Force amongst them. Of course, every other asylum seeker or refugee who has come to Australia for urgent medical care has been approved by either Minister Dutton or Minister Coleman. But, despite this, the Minister for Home Affairs has been vigorously arguing that 'two doctors from Nimbin' can force the government to bring people from Manus or Nauru to Australia. These claims are simply not true, and the minister knows it. At every step of the way, the government or government-appointed doctors control who comes to Australia through the medevac process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps this is why the minister hasn't proposed any amendments to the medevac legislation. In his desperation to prevent the passage of the bill earlier this year, the Minister for Home Affairs claimed that a thousand people would flood Australia through medevac. This hasn't happened at all. Let's be clear: approximately 90 people now have been approved to come to Australia through the regime, and all of these transfers of people have been explicitly approved by ministers or ministerially appointed doctors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I should briefly mention reports today that a boat from Sri Lanka has been intercepted by the Australian Border Force. It just so happens that this story appears in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on the day this bill is being debated—what a coincidence that is! But this has nothing to do with medevac, and the minister's foolish attempts to link the two show that once again he's all about wedge politics and not concerned with good or decent public policy. We know the Easter bombings in Sri Lanka have been acting as a push factor in that part of the world. I'm very confident that our Border Force personnel will be acting professionally in dealing with any such people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course this Minister for Home Affairs has plenty of form when it comes to over-the-top claims. This is the man who, it should be noted—and as we, on this side of the House, remember—was voted the worst health minister in Australia's history and was the architect of the GP co-payment. He said, in his typically opportunistic way:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, he wilfully mischaracterises the legislation, in the most inflammatory tones. Dictating doctors—really? I'll say it again: the process we are talking about—the process the government is proposing to repeal—balances medical opinion with an appropriate ministerial discretion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's also remember: the doctors clearly aren't making all this up. The only person making things up in this debate is the Minister for Home Affairs. We had the ludicrous situation earlier this year where the minister was going around telling people that Australians were going to be displaced from hospital beds and other health services by this. Then the Prime Minister backed in this falsehood, and he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's just a simple fact. If we've got to treat more people in Australia, then obviously they're going to take the place of people who were getting that treatment anyway. It's just simple math.</span>

They have the baby here and the moment they step off the plane their lawyers lodge papers in the federal court, which injuncts us from sending them back.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as the Australian Medical Association noted, the minister said that without providing any evidence to back up his claims—these extraordinary and offensive claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to ask the question: why, exactly, is this bill being debated in the House this week? I remind members opposite that the Senate inquiry into this bill isn't due to report until 18 October. Indeed, submissions for this inquiry are open until 16 August. The government did not seek an early Senate inquiry reporting date. The extended time frame of the inquiry means that this bill cannot be brought on for debate or vote in the Senate until the sitting week commencing 11 November 2019—11 November 2019—which, again, really begs the question: why now? We all know that the Morrison government has really brought this bill on for debate today in the misguided belief that this issue is to their political benefit. Well, I'll tell you this: I don't think that people in Melbourne's or Sydney's outer suburbs or in the regions are amused by the Morrison government's political games at the expense of taking seriously its responsibility to govern on behalf of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the record in this debate the list of the incidents of incompetence and mismanagement of the Minister for Home Affairs, which is a long one. He oversaw a $300 million Australian Border Force budget blowout, resulting in the Australian Border Force fleet being ordered to stop patrols to save money on fuel, and putting the border at risk. There was the $7 million spent on the strategic review of the Department of Home Affairs that we're just not allowed to see. I wonder why that might be the case. ANAO report after report has highlighted significant mismanagement and waste or the minister's failure to manage offshore contracts. We think, of course, about Paladin in this regard as the most extreme example of many. And who could forget that ridiculous press conference by the Prime Minister on Christmas Island last year—a press conference that cost an estimated $60,000? And right now we see the Minister for Home Affairs embarking on a disgraceful attempt to privatise Australia's visa processing system. I mean, seriously—who on earth thinks it's a good idea to sell off our visa processing system? I note this isn't something that the minister—or, indeed, his colleagues—seems to be particularly keen to talk about. We should be very, very clear about this: selling off our visa system is a bad idea that could lead to thousands of job losses, cuts to services, increased visa fraud and also data security risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the only problem that the bill before the House is designed to solve is a political one—a political one of the government's own making. The Morrison government has talked about problems with the approach that's currently law in Australia but has put forward no solution by way of amendment. How the minister and the government have chosen to engage in the debate over the medical treatment of refugees and asylum seekers in PNG and on Nauru is as important and revealing as it is shocking. It's shocking that members of Australia's government would wilfully mischaracterise a proposed law and its consequences and recklessly demonise vulnerable people—of course it is, however accustomed we may be to this from this government—but there is something more to this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The manner in which the minister has responded to calls for changes in the medical treatment regime exposes a difficult truth on the part of the government—that is, they lack the courage of their convictions. We see that obviously in the speakers list for this debate. A confident minister would welcome debate and would be comfortable defending his position calmly and rationally. He or she would look forward to the opportunity of exposing the shortcomings of alternatives in a considered and thoughtful way, looking to expert opinion and to our shared values as Australians, but not this minister and not this government. This is all about cheap politics—never the policy nor the people affected. For him the politics in turn is all about defending his position, nothing more than this so that we should look away from his failure to achieve resettlement for too many refugees after nearly six years in office. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look to the record of medical treatment and medical transfers, we see a litany of shameful events and an even more shameful refusal to accept responsibility, which is at the heart of the medevac legislation. That he won't talk about this is telling. That he continually seeks to deflect and confuse is telling. It exposes the gaping hole at the centre of his position here—that he can't find a genuine basis to oppose the legislation presently in place, which simply codifies what always should have been happening: medical treatment based on medical advice with appropriate discretion for the minister so that any wider policy or security questions can be had regard to in the national interest. That is why I urge members, particularly members opposite, to support the second reading amendment I have moved and to oppose this unnecessary and destructive legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  I second the amendment. I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019 and to oppose the repeal. This bill is a repeal bill. This bill seeks to repeal the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Act 2019, what we call the medevac law. The 45th Parliament passed this in February. The law is working. The law allows sick people in Australia's care to get medical treatment. It is that simple. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened since it became law in February? Approximately 96 people, as of today, have been approved under this new law and around 40 people have come to Australia under the new law. Eighty per cent went through the ministerial sign off—they were signed off by the minister—and the rest had approval of the government-appointed medical panel. It is working. From what I have been told, the medical panel looked at 21 and in around 13 instances the panel supported the minister's position and in eight instances it opposed the minister's position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition pointed out today the fact that prior to the medevac law being passed the government actually transferred around 900 people to Australia because they were sick. So the government was transferring people anyway. The difference was that the government was doing everything it could in the judiciary to fight against the transfer requests. They fought them in the courts, every single case. That's what they did—over 900 transfers, and they fought nearly every single one. The member for Dickson claimed that 1,000 people would flood Australia under this law. Well, that hasn't happened. Clearly he's not Nostradamus, is he, because that didn't happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 40 people have actually come under this law—as I said, 80 per cent with ministerial sign-off by your own minister, and the rest through recommendations through that government-appointed medical panel. The people who have come under this medevac law have all been approved by government ministers or the ministerial-appointed doctors. Look, it's pretty simple: it looks like this government is confirming that it wants to continue its third term of government as it began its first term—playing politics with people's lives. The government wants to cruelly deny sick people medical treatment. That's what this bill is about. That's what this repeal is about: denying sick people medical care. When you boil it down, that's what it comes down to. I can't understand why they wish to do this. Is it because they are stubborn? Is it because the bill was passed by a combination of the opposition numbers and the crossbenchers?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically they're denying sick people medical care. Is that in Australia's best interests? Is it in our national interest? It seems to me that fear has been the most prominent element of the debate around this issue, particularly since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa </span>crisis two decades ago. Fear has ruled. Fear is a political weapon—fear of resisting, fear of even the imagining of being able to do something different, to find a different way forward. We as a nation have been trapped by this issue that has become so politically fraught that it's next to impossible to actually have a conversation with anyone about how we might move forward. From the far Right, and from the far Left, all we hear is people shouting at each other. This latest iteration of this fraught issue—this attempt to repeal the medevac law—is just another tactic that fits into this ongoing fear that has paralysed us. It is an attempt to demonise refugees and people seeking asylum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents fled war in Egypt 50 years ago to come to this country. The state of this debate has deeply saddened me for the past two decades particularly, because I know—and I know many other Australians know—the abiding desire we have for peace and security in a nation like Australia. That's why my parents came here. That's why they fled where they were from, to come here and to start a new life—one that was secure for them and their children and would give them a chance. That's why I have worked on these issues. That's why I've been passionate about them. I spent most of my career in national security. I have committed myself to protecting Australians and our interests. But I've also spent that time trying to cut through, hopefully, that paralysing fear that has been part of this debate, even going as far as trying to make representations at the UN and UNGA back in 2015, at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis, with people I knew, who I'd worked with, in the Obama administration around safely transporting refugees to Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in my first speech in this place I spent much of the first speech talking about how I believe that Australia has a moral, an ethical and a legal obligation to care for those refugees who have been physically, emotionally and mentally harmed by the conditions of detention they have experienced. Rather than just talk about it, we work towards that, in so many different ways. The policies that we worked on in opposition and that we put to the Australian people at the last election were part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that in early 2017 the government then led by Malcolm Turnbull tried to pass the so-called lifetime ban bill. That would have meant a ludicrous lifetime ban on refugees from Manus and Nauru ever coming to Australia. It was really a smokescreen for the abject failure of the Turnbull government at that point in time, which for over three years had failed to find resettlement arrangements for the refugees languishing on Manus and Nauru. It was so ridiculous to have a potential scenario where a refugee could make it to New Zealand, maybe become a minister in the New Zealand government within 10 years and then want to visit Australia—Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visited us just last week—but, sorry, if that law had passed, they wouldn't have been able to come into the country. That's how preposterous it was. We got to a point in this country where the government were putting up bills that would have had that kind of effect so that they could feed that fear. Maybe it was beneficial for them politically to keep feeding that, but it's ridiculous. It makes no-one safer. It doesn't add to our national security. It diminishes us as a people, because we have a duty of care for those people. It's not just about international law; it's not just about domestic law. It's about doing what's right and decent, as one human being to another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We opposed that, quite rightly, as an opposition. I came out and said it was ridiculous. And yet we're still here. We're still here tonight debating the same kinds of attempts by this government to stoke that fear. I've got to say how disgusted I was, when we passed the medevac law back in February, that MP and senator after MP and senator on the government side went out and said: 'In passing the medevac law, Labor has just allowed murderers, rapists and paedophiles to come into Australia.' That's what they were saying on the news, in their interviews in the press and on the radio. It was absolutely disgraceful. It was one of the lowest points in my time here, witnessing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, just to top things off, you will all recall Hakeem Al-Araibi, the young fellow who plays football for Pascoe Vale Football Club in my electorate and who lives in the electorate of the member who preceded me in this debate. He was here for an exhibition game, because we got him out of Thailand and that issue that he was facing. He's a refugee. And some of same MPs who were in the media talking about us letting in rapists, murderers and paedophiles came down to have a kick with him and take a selfie with him. It was absolute hypocrisy. Together with Fos, Craig Foster, a friend of mine from my SBS days, we'd worked so hard to get Hakeem out of the situation he was in. But we had all these Liberal and National Party MPs and senators coming down to get their selfie with Hakeem, because it was the news of the day. All credit to Marise Payne—she made a good effort, as foreign minister, to get him out. But the hypocrisy of my colleagues on the other side, on the government benches, who came out to take their picture with him while, at the same time that morning, saying that we—Labor and the crossbenchers who'd passed the medevac law—were allowing murderers, rapists and paedophiles into the country was absolutely disgraceful and it saddened me to the core.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We worked on policies, as a party, in the previous parliament. I was working with colleagues such as Ged Kearney, the member for what is now Cooper, and many others on a whole range of policies as part of the immigration working group. We took good policies to the last election. We made a commitment to end indefinite detention on Manus and Nauru. We made a commitment to double the refugee intake. We made a commitment to a new community sponsored refugee program that would increase the number by another 5,000. I moved that motion at our party conference and was very proud to do so. We made a commitment of a $500 million investment into the UNHCR, to work with them on regional frameworks and regional solutions to help alleviate the issues facing the 25 million refugees registered by the UNHCR globally. We put forward an independent children's advocate and a 90-day processing rule. We put forward a policy to end TPVs and SHEVs to make sure that if you are found to be a genuine refugee you are given that status.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  The party of wage stagnation and rampant wage theft is now gearing up to rob workers of their superannuation savings as well. We are told that at least a dozen Liberals want to strip Australians of the super increases that they need and deserve and were promised. I gave the Prime Minister multiple opportunities in this House to rule out any changes to increasing the super guarantee to 12 per cent and he couldn't or wouldn't do it. The Treasurer was given five opportunities on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> program. The trade minister would only say that they won't change it 'at this point in time'. The finance minister did say that they'd leave it alone, but now we hear that there was a barney about it in their party room today. The weasel words and the sly language give the game away. Here we go again. They've got form and not just on super.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It always begins with backbench extremists putting pressure on the Treasurer and it always ends up with him folding under that pressure. It happened on energy and it will happen again on superannuation. At a time when company profits are remarkably strong and when wages are worryingly stagnant, those opposite are looking to thieve the 2.5 per cent increase to super which will help more people save for their retirement. That 2½ per cent could go to super or to wages, and the government want it to go to neither. They want that 2½ per cent ploughed back into company profits, which are already steadily rising at the expense of workers and wages. They say that they want workers to have the freedom to choose wages or super. When they say that, what they really mean is they want people to have the freedom to be broke during their working years and then afterwards as well. This, you see, is just the thin end of the wedge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite succeed on this, they won't stop there. They pretend that they support the superannuation guarantee, while at the same time they do their best to undermine it and ultimately kill it by making it voluntary, by taking the 'compulsory' out of compulsory super. Some of those opposite talk openly about this, but we didn't hear a peep about it at the election—not from the PM, not from the Treasurer. From none of those opposite did we hear of these plans. Instead, we got crocodile tears for retirees during the election, and then afterwards the sword. A government which has banged on about mandates and retiree taxes is ambushing workers with a retiree tax of its own—a real retiree tax of 2½ per cent on the living standards in retirement of almost 13 million Australian workers. According to one estimate, a 30-year-old earning $80,000 a year would be denied close to $90,000 in super by the time they reach retirement if the super guarantee remains frozen at 9½ per cent, and this would not be an accident; it would be a deliberate policy objective of those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have never believed in super. They opposed universal compulsory super. They voted against increasing the SG above three per cent. They froze it multiple times. They tried to abolish the low-income super contribution scheme. They tried to weaken penalties for employers who didn't pay the right amount. The reason they do all this is that their ideology is far more important to them than the financial security of Australian workers in retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor giant Paul Keating created our world-leading super system so workers could have dignity in retirement and the nation could draw on a big source of homegrown savings to invest in its own future. What a remarkable game-changing, nation-changing creation super has been, with $2.8 trillion in assets—bigger than our country's gross domestic product. If that savings pool was a country in its own right, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world, just behind India and ahead of Italy. I mention all of this not just out of pride but also to show what needs to be protected from the dishonest and disastrous agenda of those opposite. If this government wants a fight on the superannuation guarantee, it will get one. If they want to steal the retirement incomes from ordinary Australian workers, they'll have to go through the Labor Party first.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  There are few issues that are as important as the work currently being undertaken by state and federal governments to reduce our national suicide rate. On average, by the end of just today, eight Australians will have taken their own life and 180 more will have attempted to do so. The Prime Minister has made this a personal mission, and I applaud him for that decision. I know that in this he has the support of members across the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In early June, I had the opportunity to see the Prime Minister's dedication firsthand when he invited me and the members for Berowra, Reid and Fisher to join him as he met with ministers and senior bureaucrats to discuss the government's approach to suicide. I did not, however, anticipate that, within weeks of that meeting, I would be attending the funeral of a dear friend who lost his own awful battle with mental illness. Dan Webb was one of the most genuine, kind, popular and beautiful souls you could ever meet. Yet at the age of 40, we lost him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was sitting at my desk writing these remarks on Sunday night, I received an email from a young resident of Lane Cove, in my own constituency. She was motivated to email after learning that one of her peers, a girl in her own year at school, had taken her life over the weekend. She was just 16. In her email she wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It scares me that someone I considered a friend did not feel that they had adequate support, or a way of seeking help. I really want to do something about this ... I am hoping that by contacting you, we may be able to have a discussion about how to improve the mental health of young people in North Sydney and how to move forward for a positive future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be having that conversation with her as soon as I return from Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Challenges with mental health affect us all in different ways. You don't need to be struggling yourself to be impacted by its reach. We all have a family member, a friend or a colleague who is struggling with a mental health issue. Those who struggle too often do so in silence, without help and without hope. Young Australians in particular are facing a crisis of mental health challenges that has never been seen before in our country, with 18- to 24-year-olds experiencing higher levels of mental illness than any other age group. For young Australians in this age bracket, suicide is the leading cause of death. There has also been significant commentary about suicide rates in other sections of our community, particularly among veterans and Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pause for a moment to focus on one other suicide rate, which often does not receive the focus it deserves: the tragically high suicide rates amongst the LGBTI community. Our understanding is limited because there is a paucity of national data collection, but what we have points to a suicide rate among young LGBTI Australians that is five times the national average. Incredibly, it is 11 times the average in the trans community. A starting point must be to ensure that we do have the data to track and respond to the challenges facing this part of our community. Beyond that, there is a strong case for improving services specifically for those in the LGBTI community—for example, expanding specific community-led mental health services alongside existing services. For those who are isolated geographically or culturally, as many are, we must look at what models are most effective in reaching young LGBTI people who are otherwise feeling utterly alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, there is such a powerful message about the consequences of bigotry and stigmatisation. It is so much better than it was 40 years ago, but it still rears its head in such damaging manifestations. With $4.9 billion expected to be spent on mental health this year alone, we are able to make new progress and provide new services that have never been seen before, as well as build on the existing infrastructure that we know is working. This includes the $375 million investment that we are making as a government to support headspace, the flagship support service that is providing young people with the help they need to overcome their mental health challenges. I would like to take this opportunity in this place to recognise the exceptional work of the headspace team in Chatswood, in my own electorate. Thank you for everything you are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the responsibility to help those facing mental health challenges lies not just with the government. As much as we make it a priority, it lies with each and every one of us as individuals. It's why the work of organisations like batyr is so important. The 600 young people it has trained and marshalled to tell their own positive stories have reached over 170,000 young people, and this is helping to reduce the debilitating stigma of mental ill health. I was thrilled to see the government announce additional funding for their work just last month. It is this approach, a partnership between government, community and all of us as individuals, which has to be the pillar of everything we do. As our Prime Minister declared to a crowded stadium of young school students last month, we must make these commitments, because people, especially young people, matter so much. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I've spoken many times in this parliament about the amazing contribution that the diverse African-Australian communities in Melbourne make to the electorate. They help make it one of the best places in the country, if not the world. A little while ago, I joined them, queueing with my kids to get on the train ride at the Eid festival that was organised at Debneys Park. A short time ago, I was at the launch of the new Victoria Police African Employee Network, an amazing initiative that follows some work that the likes of Berhan Ahmed and Yaseen Musa have done in getting the state government to recruit a number of members of the African community to Victoria Police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to the Carlton public housing estate at 510 Lygon Street on Friday mornings, you will find an incredible market run by the community grocers. It has also been joined by a number of stalls put on by various members of the African-Australian community in Melbourne and Carlton which are now attracting people from all around the electorate and helping make that place incredibly vibrant. Not that long ago, I joined many other members from the community—indeed, there were members from the council and the Lord Mayor, Sally Capp, and others—at the Africa Day celebrations at Melbourne Town Hall, which was truly an amazing event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these people came here several generations ago, seeking to make a better life in Melbourne. Many now have been born and bred here. The job of government at all levels should be not only to celebrate their achievements and to recognise the challenges but also, in many instances, to get its foot off the throats of the African-Australian communities, because, in too many instances, people in my community are facing racism, bigotry and discrimination, and too often the people whom that comes from includes people in this place. Not only do we need to fight racism wherever it occurs; we need to get government to do the job of addressing the challenges that we face from systemic racism and discrimination in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the stats, they back up the stories that people in my electorate tell me every day. The unemployment rate in the Australian-Sudanese community in my electorate is 37 per cent. That is around seven times higher than the national unemployment rate across the country. Across Victoria, that rate is 32 per cent. In the Australia-Eritrean community in Victoria, it's 20 per cent; in Melbourne, it's 24 per cent. An analysis by the ABS found that over 50 per cent of young educated migrants from English-speaking countries were able to find professional level jobs, compared to just 24 per cent of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. In other words, if you come from a non-English-speaking background, you're more than twice as likely to find yourself in a job where you are not able to use your skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been trying for a while to get the government to pay attention to this unemployment and underemployment crisis, which in many instances is just the result of racism, and I've heard a number of stories from people who turn up for jobs. I remember speaking to one woman, called Fatma, who told me that she went for an interview for a job as a cleaner and was told, 'No, we can't give you a job as a cleaner because your hijab makes it an OHS issue.' A number of people have told me that after finishing their degree at RMIT or Melbourne university they fire off job application after job application and get no response. But when they change the name on the job application from Mohammed to David, all of a sudden the phone starts ringing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the stories of what is happening to the real people behind these statistics. Government needs to step in with job creation programs, assistance and campaigns to get rid of discrimination. But what we also need in Melbourne is a place especially for young people to gather, because, with unemployment stats like these, you've got to ask yourself: what do you do in Melbourne on a Friday or Saturday night when you are not going to a job and not working? At the moment there's nowhere to go. There was a chance that the Flemington Community Centre redevelopment could have been that. That's about 100 metres from the border of my electorate. If you know that area, you will know the people who live in North Melbourne and Kensington; the community is very tight there. There was a chance that could have been it. The local council recently decided to slash funding for that, from $40 million to $20 million, and now there is a question about whether the project is going to go ahead at all. We need a community space for people in Melbourne to meet. We desperately need a space for African-Australian communities and young people that is controlled by them, that is open to them, and where they can meet. If the government is serious about saying it wants to make sure everyone is engaged, then provide the support for a place for people to meet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  In the lead-up to the May election, the Morrison government had a plan set out in the budget that was carefully crafted to provide timely support to hardworking Australians. Since the election, we've successfully legislated our tax plan that will deliver more than $300 billion of tax relief over the next 10 years. That's what's happened. It includes long-term structural reform that abolishes an entire tax bracket and will see 94 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax reforms are the most significant in 20 years. Our tax relief plan will provide immediate support for 66,500 people living in my electorate of O'Connor. That's great news for workers and our local economy. When taxpayers keep more of what they earn, it encourages and rewards hard work. It means hardworking families can get ahead, and more money flows through our economy. Those earning between $48,000 and $94,000 will receive the full $1,080, and dual-income couples will receive up to $2,160. Australia-wide, around 4.5 million taxpayers will receive the full $1,080 tax offset. The offset tapers down to $255 for those earning between $22,000 and $48,000, and $135 for those earning between $94,000 and $120,000. Those earning under $21,000 pay no tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This extra boost will come in very handy for many families living and working in O'Connor—such as Goldfields couple Kate and Peter Kuusimaa, who have just welcomed their first child Tavi, and Kiara Torr, a mother from Albany who will be using her tax offset to pay her council rates. Our tax relief package provides a further $158 billion in tax relief, building on the already legislated personal income tax plan we announced in the 2018-19 budget. The government has also locked in the benefits for low- and middle-income tax relief by increasing the top threshold of 19c in the dollar bracket from $41,000 to $45,000 and by increasing the low-income tax offset from $645 to $700 in 2022-23. In combination with the legislated removal of the 37c in the dollar tax bracket in 2024-25, the government is delivering structural reform to the tax system by reducing the 32.5c in the dollar tax rate to 30c in the dollar. Together these tax relief measures will create a flatter and better tax system that will improve incentives for those hardworking people in my electorate of O'Connor. It will also ensure that 94 per cent of Australians will face a marginal tax rate no higher than 30c in the dollar in 2024-25. I'm thrilled that our government has swiftly delivered on our promise to build a better tax system and provide tax relief in time for this year's tax return. The personal income tax measures announced in the last two budgets will together boost household incomes in aggregate across Australia by $8 billion per year. With these tax cuts targeted to lower- and middle-income Australians, who by necessity tend to have a higher spend, we expect to see a flowthrough into higher household consumption and a boost to the retail sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deeming rates are also an issue that has been raised with me many times by seniors on pensions or part-pensions. We have listened to their concerns and now we have acted to support those older Australians who receive a part-pension. More than 6,100 people in O'Connor are set to benefit from a cut to deeming rates over the next four years. The lower deeming rate will decrease from 1.75 per cent to one per cent for financial investments up to $51,800 for single pensioners and $86,200 for pensioner couples. The upper deeming rate will be cut from 3.25 per cent to three per cent for balances above these amounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have taken a sensible approach to supporting older Australians because we understand pensioners have fixed incomes. This means more money in the pockets of older Australians. Under the new rates, age pensioners whose income is now assessed using deeming will receive up to $40.50 a fortnight extra or $1,053 per year for couples and $31 a fortnight or $804 a year for singles. Changes to the deeming rate will also benefit people receiving other income-tested payments. These include the disability support pension and carer payments, income support allowance and supplements such as the parenting payment and Newstart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have previously reduced the tax burden on the engine room of our economy, the small business sector, turning over up to $50 million, by progressively reducing their tax rate from 30c to 25c in the dollar. I'm particularly proud that we've achieved these huge reductions in tax at the same time as forecasting the first budget surplus in 12 years. I'm confident the government's economic plan will help boost the economy in the many months ahead in my electorate of O'Connor. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I would like to first take this opportunity to thank the people of Barton for placing their faith and confidence in me to represent them for another term in this parliament. I am very proud to represent the electorate of Barton. Barton represents a microcosm of modern Australia. It is one of the most culturally diverse electorates in the nation, home to some of the largest Greek, Arabic, Chinese and Nepalese communities in Australia. While the result of the election was not what everyone hoped, the campaign provided me with a wonderful opportunity to crisscross the electorate from Canterbury to Marrickville, Rockdale, Kogarah and Hurstville and to catch up with the many wonderful groups and residents doing wonderful things in our local communities. I pledge first and foremost to the electors of Barton that I will continue to advocate and provide a strong voice for their interests in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to extend my congratulations and heartfelt condolences, which I'll explain in a moment, to Don and Doreen Kinna of Bexley, who celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary last month. Sadly, Doreen has just passed away, and I want to say to Don that we are so sorry for that. But, for 72 years, what an inspiration! Don and Doreen met at a local dance after having noticed each other on a tram. On 21 June 1947, they married at St Andrew's Cathedral in the heart of Sydney. They celebrated their long and happy marriage at the Uniting Banks Lodge in Peakhurst. Don continues to live in the family home of 66 years and he would travel every day to see Doreen at the nursing home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to be invited to celebrate their happy day and to witness their love for each other. It was truly inspiring. Their life together has also been shared with the local community. Don and Doreen worked tirelessly for many years raising funds for Pathfinders, a charity for the blind. They also worked for the St George Football Club, where Don, a life member, was a linesman and a scoreboard volunteer for many years. They gave up many weekends to cook sausage sizzles for the club. Sadly, as I said, Doreen passed away last month. I want to say to Don: you have our great sorrow, but what a truly inspirational love and marriage you had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May we observed Nepalese Republic Day. It is the 12th Nepalese Republic Day since Nepal's establishment as a federal democratic republic on 29 May 2000. This is an auspicious occasion for the people of Nepal and the electorate of Barton. The electorate of Barton is the home of one of the largest and fastest-growing Nepalese communities in Australia. Other than English, Nepali is the fifth most spoken language in Barton. It is the second most common country of birth in Barton. I am so proud to be able to represent the Nepalese community in this place. We wish the people of Nepal a peaceful and prosperous future and happy Ganatantra Diwas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was just NAIDOC Day recently. I know many members of this chamber participated in many NAIDOC events across the country. I want to acknowledge that this month we did celebrate National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee, and the theme this year was voice, treaty and truth. This is an important event on our national calendar not just for First Nations people but for all Australians. It was an opportunity for us as a nation to celebrate the history, culture and achievement of First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people have made tremendous contributions to Australia in a variety of ways. NAIDOC honours these achievements and contributions, which are a source of pride for all Australians. I, like others, attended on many days, but I particularly wanted to put on record the NAIDOC Awards Ceremony in Canberra which I attended. The winners of the NAIDOC Awards were Dean Duncan, David Gulpilil, Thelma Weston, Greg Little, the Littlewell Working Group, Mi-kaisha Masella, Elma Gada Kris, Professor Michael McDaniel, Ganur Maynard and Shantelle Thompson. It was an enormous honour to be there along with the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Minister Ken Wyatt. We presented the Elder of the Year awards to two extremely amazing people, and it was a great honour. I have to say that the response of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members that were there to both of us being there was tremendous.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  During the election, I was contacted by Kathlene Jones, the founder and CEO of the Prader-Willi Research Foundation Australia. Her daughter, Chloe, was the catalyst for the Prader-Willi Research Foundation. Chloe is in prep at Brighton Beach Primary School and is a real superstar go-getter. Prader-Willi syndrome is a randomly occurring disorder where some of the genes in chromosome 15 are inactive or missing. After receiving news of a positive genetic test, parents of affected children have, of course, a lot to process and deal with. Their children have a life expectancy of potentially less than 30 years. They will have developmental delays, challenging behaviours, mental illness and the hallmark feature of the disease—a feeling of relentless hunger. It's bitter reality, but the strength, resilience and courage those kids show to do things that most kids take for granted are truly remarkable. The condition is largely unknown even though it affects one in every 15,000 babies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prader-Willi Research Foundation has launched a funding campaign called Finding 15 to raise awareness and funds to drive innovative research and find new treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome. The first weekend of May featured the inaugural Finding 15 Walk to Change Life, which saw over 800 people across five locations in Australia come together to walk towards better treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome. Sandringham Athletic Club in Hampton had a very relaxed atmosphere where the Goldstein community and those from surrounding communities stood shoulder to shoulder in support of the Finding 15 campaign. I'd like to acknowledge Kathlene Jones and her outstanding advocacy for young Chloe, as well as those families touched by Prader-Willi syndrome all over Australia.</span>

                  </a>  Money raised during Connor's Run 2019 will count towards a $1.25 million pledge to fund new research projects—a combination of preclinical studies and trials based studies. Depending on your fitness level, there is an 18.8 kilometre run from Hampton or a 9.6 kilometre run or walk from St Kilda if you like the softer option. Both finish on the banks of the Yarra River just outside the central business district of the great city of Melbourne. The run starts with a warm-up, coffee, yoga stretching and some dance aerobics. And I know the member for Hunter will want to do some of those dance aerobics. He hides it, but it's innate in who he is. To help offset the muscle soreness, the afterparty barbecue on the Yarra includes DJs, bands, fun activities at the finish line and even, occasionally, a couple of celebrities. Every dollar raised helps fund the innovation that will lead to better outcomes for paediatric brain cancer patients and support existing patients in the interim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the level of community support across the last three Connor's Runs—and, as I have reminded the member for Hunter, I was there and I finished them—the AIM BRAIN Project is now fully funded. This means world-class molecular diagnostic testing is available to every child in Australia and New Zealand. This world-leading technology helps doctors better understand and classify individual tumours. With a clearer understanding of each tumour, specialists can create better, more personalised treatments based on both the placement of a tumour and its molecular build. The RCD Foundation has also joined forces with the Financial Markets Foundation for Children, the incredible work of the federal government—because when you deliver a budget surplus, you can support important health outcomes, particularly under the leadership of the current health minister—and Carrie's Beanies 4 Brain Cancer to pledge a total of $10 million over five years for paediatric brain cancer clinical trials. Now that the AIM BRAIN Project is firmly in place, it can determine the best clinical trials available for each child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these projects don't come about by accident; they come about because people take initiative and do the right thing. In memory of Connor, his parents, Liz and Scott Dawes, set up the RCD Foundation to set an example not just for our community—though it has—but of course for every parent who wants to support the memory of their lost child.</span>

Since his arrest on 15 January this year, Mr Chau has been held in detention without charge by the Vietnamese authorities. Mr Chau is being investigated for his alleged activities against the Communist Party of Vietnam, including, as I understand it, an attempt to overthrow the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vietnam is one of the most prolific jailers of peaceful activists in the region. Basic civil rights, including freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, are severely restricted. Communist Party courts have issued increasingly harsh prison sentences for activists convicted of vague national security charges. Australia needs to do everything in its power to ensure that an Australian citizen is not subject to the impulses of a government widely known for severely punishing people who dare to criticise its rule. This case must be expedited, and Australia should demand the release of Mr Chau from indefinite detention without charge in Vietnam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Chau resides in Bankstown and is a prominent figure in our Vietnamese diaspora. He's highly involved in the promotion of human rights, democracy and social justice issues in our community. For years he has worked to shed light on Vietnam's ongoing crackdown on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Six months ago, Mr Chau went to Vietnam on a fact-finding trip and never returned. Since his arrest, he has only been allowed monthly consular visits, which have now been monitored by the Vietnamese authorities, restricting his ability to talk freely. He has been denied legal representation so far during a period of ongoing investigation. The investigation has been extended until September and could be extended further. It is most doubtful that the trial process will be open and fair, given the Vietnamese courts remain firmly under the control of the Communist government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with Mr Chau's wife and two sons, who are deeply depressed over his unknown fate. They are increasingly concerned about his mental and physical wellbeing. His family and the Vietnamese community in Australia are pleading for the Australian government to bring home this 70-year-old Australian. This is a man of good repute who has contributed to our society. He came to this country as a boat person some 30 years ago. The Australian government has an obligation to protect the rights of its citizens. I therefore urge the government to pressure the Vietnamese authorities to expedite this case and call for Mr Chau's unconditional release.</span>

                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I rise this afternoon to talk about an industry that forms part of the lifeblood of my electorate. Tourism is certainly a big deal in my neck of the woods. We have the best natural offerings in the nation, such as the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree Rainforest and our wet tropics. There's absolutely no doubt that the Great Barrier Reef is critically important to the Queensland and national economy. It contributes around $6.4 billion a year to Australia's economy along with 64,000 jobs, many of which are in my electorate. People travel from all over the world to experience the natural wonders in our backyard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it's not only the natural wonders that attract people to my electorate. We have some of the best accommodation and some of the greatest tourist attractions and hospitality offerings in our state. Take billionaire Ghassan Aboud, who has invested hundreds of millions of dollars of his own funds into building three world-class hotels in our city—the first new hotels built in more than two decades. Mr Aboud should be and needs to be applauded for his vision and, most importantly, for his vote of confidence in our city and our region. We've also had some of the best tourism operators in the nation such as the CaPTA Group, Quicksilver, Experience Co, Cairns Aquarium, Skyrail and Nautilus, just to name a few. They have invested significant amounts of money in offering new products to our domestic and international visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, unfortunately our tourism sector is doing it a little tough at the moment. There's certainly light at the end of the tunnel. According to the latest data, international visitor numbers to Tropical North Queensland are down 3.1 per cent. While the numbers might be down, the 849,000 international visitors to Tropical North Queensland spent a staggering $1.077 billion— up 2.7 per cent—in that period of time. Domestic tourism, however, is faring a little better. According to the latest data, more than $2.065 million domestic tourists have visited Tropical North Queensland in the year ending December 2018. These visitors spent $2.3 billion, a significant increase from the previous year. That's not bad for a little community of 170,000 permanent residents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research has continually shown that people want more for their holidays. They want different and unique experiences, and we must adapt to cater to that. One exciting new attraction that will absolutely cater for this is the Wangetti Trail. Once completed it will be a world-leading ecotourism attraction. It was designed by the world-renowned trail designer, Cairns local Glen Jacobs, and will offer an amazing experience—funded in part by the national Tourism Icons Package, which was announced by the federal government this year. I also acknowledge the significant amount from the Queensland government. It shows that we actually work together. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  On Sunday afternoon I joined 500 people at a rally to protest the New South Wales Liberal government's shameful neglect of the Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick. I pay tribute to and thank the families of sick children, the surgeons, the doctors, the medical professionals and the members of our community who also came together to protest this disgusting decision. The reason for the protest is that the New South Wales Liberal government is shutting the paediatric cardiology unit at the Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick. This is despite the fact that a written guarantee was given by Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Health Minister Brad Hazzard that the unit at Randwick Sydney Children's Hospital would be maintained and remain open. The Premier promised our community and the people of New South Wales, and she has reneged on that commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a growing population in our area. Members of our community want better health services, not cuts to health services. But that is exactly what this broken promise does. It will put children's lives at risk, and it's a decision that must be reversed. The parents who spoke at the rally conveyed their views of the importance of this service. We heard from the parents of two sick children whose lives were saved by the expertise of doctors who work in this unit. They were saved because the hospital had a cardiac surgery unit able to operate and save those lives. This is the exact service that the New South Wales government wants to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision does not make any sense whatsoever. The cost of running the unit is $6 million per year. They want to shut a unit providing cardiac services for children for $6 million. This is the government that just paid $576 million in compensation to a company building the bungled Sydney light rail project. Government is about priorities. What is this Liberal government's priority: $6 million to save children's lives at the children's hospital or $576 million because it stuffed up the light rail project? It says everything about this government's priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not an expert in this. Some have said this is a turf war between doctors. But, as a parent, I know that if I had a sick child who required urgent cardiac surgery then I'd want them to know that they had the best care possible. I'd be petrified if I were told that my child had to be transferred to another hospital because that $6 million service had been shut down in the particular hospital in Randwick. The experts who have spoken out have been warned by the New South Wales health department for this. I say to those doctors who have spoken out: bravo. We support you 100 per cent; 36,000 people have signed a change.org petition to protest this decision. I call on others to support the campaign to stop the closure of this unit at the Randwick children's hospital. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Last Thursday I had the opportunity to attend two separate functions in Shepparton. The first was an invitation by Brent Rothacker to attend the Victorian No-Till Farmers Association's annual conference. Over 200 members were there eagerly awaiting each of the various presentations about how far the broadacre cropping sector had come with the different technologies that they now use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian No-Till Farmers Association is a farming group led by farmers who are passionate about improving the natural function of our soils and landscapes by farming regeneratively. That involves reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides and substituting for them with biofertilisers and other methods to build soil biology, including increasing the amount of carbon that we hold in our soils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second forum was one held by the Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority and was mainly based on the environmental river flows on the lower Goulburn River. The forum was attended basically by environmental scientists, academics and stakeholders. One of the key topics of this forum was examining the findings of five years of monitoring the effects of environmental flows on the lower Goulburn River.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on the one hand, at one meeting we had a group of farmers developing practical in-paddock farming systems to grow better food and fibre by improving soil health. These were real, hands-on environmental farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, those at the lower Goulburn water forum were looking at how they were using 100 gigalitres of water—which, today, is valued at $60 million—and working out how they were going to use 100 gigalitres of water to repair the banks of the lower Goulburn River by lifting the seed to germinate on the banks. These river banks had been damaged slightly by trade flows—the high flows in the summer months. The absurdity of this is that, next irrigation season, the high flows of trade water are going to re-damage the banks, and yet we will have wasted $60 million worth of water that could have been so much better used had it been returned to agriculture. When you try to explain this to the dairy farmers who are desperate for additional water that they could purchase, they cannot believe it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I walk on the banks of the Goulburn River most days when I'm in my electorate, because I live nearby. The banks of the river are not so degraded that they need to spend $60 million worth of water to try to fix them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all members of parliament should have a good think about this. We should realise that we need to place the health of our farmers above the health of our fish.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I've started the 46th Parliament in much the same way as I started the 45th Parliament—that is, by asking the relevant minister to appoint me to the Forum on Western Sydney Airport. FOWSA is the only way my community finds out about the plans for Sydney's second airport—well, that and <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span>. Information about the government's plans is hidden behind what has turned into a veneer of community consultation. While we have a community member supposedly representing the mountains, that person is invisible to most people and information being shared in between annual public drop-in sessions is virtually non-existent. What's more, the information people really want—the information about what the thinking is on flight paths—is non-existent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What independent research is showing about the noise the planes will make is that it has been vastly underestimated by the government's own environmental impact statement. This independent research is not based on modelling; it's based on accurately measuring the actual noise planes make flying to and from Sydney Airport at heights similar to those predicted for the mountains and Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only flight paths for the second Sydney airport we've been shown were in the EIS, and it painted a frightening picture of planes flying into Badgerys Creek 24 hours a day over the lower Blue Mountains, and at lower altitudes for take-offs over suburbs in Sydney's west like St Clair. Engineers Eric Ancich and Don Carter measured planes as they flew over Pymble and Parramatta—similar distances from Sydney Airport. The results show that the computer modelling done for the EIS fails to take into account the actual range of heights that aircraft fly at and, therefore, underestimates how noisy they are. What the results show is that the noise is likely to be three to four times louder than the estimates in the EIS claim for the lower Blue Mountains—three to four times!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department of infrastructure and Airservices know about this variability. They know that, where it's estimated that a plane flies at 3,000 feet, they actually have a range of 2,500 to 5,000 feet. These noise measurements by Ancich and Carter, based on real flights, flying in real time, are obviously relevant to daytime flights because Sydney Airport has a curfew, which the second Sydney airport won't. The planes will fly through the night, nonstop, and they will be even noisier. Whether you think the airport is a great idea or, like me, you have serious concerns about its impact, the community should be fully informed. Australia has already told the World Heritage Committee that the airport might result in 'some noise impacts on amenity within the property'; in other words, it's going to have an impact. A deceptive EIS, underestimating the heights, does not do this government proud.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  I'd like to start by quoting the Prime Minister: 'How good is Queensland!' I'd like to go one step further and say: 'How good is Townsville!' I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to the work of the Rotary Club of Townsville Sunrise in my electorate of Herbert and, in particular, their recent work to help a local mum, doing it tough, to support her daughter. Four-year-old Tahlia suffers from a rare neurological disorder that causes multiple daily seizures and severely restricts her mobility. Doctors say she will never be able to walk, crawl or feed herself. Tahlia's mum, Cassandra, takes care of her daughter on a full-time basis, relying solely on a carers pension to support Tahlia and herself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cassandra had been struggling to lift Tahlia in and out of her car and was desperately in need of a vehicle that could be fitted with a wheelchair lift. Rotary Club of Townsville Sunrise members Guy and Steven heard about Cassandra and Tahlia's story and took the project to the club. The job was simple: raise $50,000, and Tahlia gets the new car she needs. Tim McKee OAM was tasked with the job to raise the money, and his fellow Rotarians didn't let him down. Following a leadership donation of $10,000 from the Townsville Sunrise club, Mundingburra Rotary Club donated $5,000, and another six local Rotary clubs contributed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the combined effort of these eight clubs ensured that well over half the money was in the bank, more was needed, so Tim turned to some old mates in business to help with the rest. Pickerings Auto Group was the first corporate partner to offer support by significantly discounting the cost of the Kia Carnival—the vehicle recommended by Tahlia's occupational therapist, Shannon Goodwin. Kia Motors Australia then came on board, discounting the cost of the vehicle even further. Not long after, Tim contacted Cassandra with the good news that all the money had been raised. Just over a week ago, Cassandra was handed the keys to a brand-new Kia Carnival wagon, fully converted with wheelchair access. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This activity, which was ultimately dubbed Project Tahlia, just goes to show the real value of Rotary to our community—even when business is doing it tough, as it has been in Herbert over the past few years. It makes me immensely proud to represent an electorate where stories like this aren't just one-offs but happen every day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I'm sure that many of us have memorable moments to share about the election campaign. One of my most memorable moments was knocking on the door of local resident Kevin Combes. Kevin is the manager of The Pantry in Wangara, which is a charitable organisation that offers food for those in need. When I knocked on Kevin's door, he told me a story and related his own experience of when he fell on hard times and how he felt during those times. His experience drove him into action to open up and offer charity to those most in need, in an environment that is non-judgemental and helps people to retain their dignity. We both shared our own stories of falling on hard times and just how difficult it is to ask for help during those times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to announce that, a short time ago, The Pantry in Wangara was awarded a Bankwest grant of $1,000. But that's never enough, because last month alone The Pantry provided 6,000 boxes of food to local residents, charities and community organisations around Cowan. They do this amazing work while relying wholly and solely on volunteers who give up their generous time. So I'd like to mention some of those volunteers. I'd like to mention Pastor Daniel Alderden, who is the pastor of the Reality Church that runs The Pantry in Wangara, and the floor managers Christine Foti, Cita Boynes, Hazel Kendrick and Kevin Dunlop, who, by the way, also gives really great hugs. All of these generous volunteers, and many, many more, give up their precious time, day in and day out, to help The Pantry do the work that it does to ensure that the people of Cowan and community groups in Cowan have access to food and the items that they need when they fall on hard times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It truly is a testament to just how bad some people are doing it out there in our community that one out of four people on Newstart are over the age of 55 and on there not because they want to be but because they can't find work or they've been retrenched. As somebody who's been in that situation, I know that many people who fall on hard times are there not out of choice but because of circumstance. So I commend Kevin and The Pantry on the wonderful work they do. They know that my door will always be open to them and I'll always support them. I commend them also for truly showing the spirit of the people of Cowan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Our traditional industries have been under attack in Queensland. The people who feed us—farmers and fishermen—sadly find that one of the greatest enemies they face is their own state government. Queensland Labor, largely led by Jackie Trad, prioritises Green votes over the votes of those living in rural and regional Queensland. In the state government departments, it appears 'Green leaners' have the upper hand. Those who make a living from the land and the sea don't have a chance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland Labor wants to introduce new fishing quotas which cut the catch of operators by 50 to 60 per cent and, in some cases, up to 80 per cent. This could destroy the state's commercial fishing industry. Many operators with 30 to 40 years of experience in the business are thinking they will need to walk away. Let's also note here that there's no compensation on the table. Take the case of Mark in Bowen—after 30 years of fishing with an average catch of eight tonnes for the past 11 years, he's being allocated a little over three tonnes. Ronnie in Proserpine, a fisherman of 31 years, will have his barramundi catch limit cut in half. Will at Alva Brach in the Burdekin will have his quota of mud crab cut by 50 per cent—that's a hit of about $30,000 a year to him. Matt in Airlie Beach, also a crabber, tells me that he's facing a 100 per cent reduction in catch. He will be wiped out by Labor. Terry Must of Arabon Seafoods in Bowen believes the restrictions on mud crabs will mean you simply won't be able to buy them locally anymore. The catch that's allowed will head straight to the Sydney market. His view is shared by Kev Collins, owner of the Fish D'vine restaurant in Airlie Beach. We already have a shortage of fishermen in the industry, and any confidence they have is being completely eroded. The Queensland minister responsible won't even give these guys the courtesy of a reply to their letters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cane farmers are getting the same tin-ear treatment from the state Labor government on its push to impose more reef laws. The Environmental Protection (Great Barrier Reef Protection Measures) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2019 before the Queensland state parliament proposes new powers to demand farm business data, impose more restrictions on land use, expand the area of farms which will face new restrictions and give broad powers to the public service to shift the goalposts on farming practices. Although the Premier rushed to Mackay following the 18 May federal election to declare she was listening to regional Queensland, she's been completely ignoring attempts by several hundred canegrowers to raise their concerns about the impacts of these insulting additional reef regulations. There's a standing invitation from the head of CANEGROWERS, Paul Schembri, for the Premier to visit his farm in Mackay and hear the concerns of the industry. Underpinning both farmers' and fishermen's concerns is whether the scientific papers underpinning the policies both on fishing and on farming are actually sound or not. It's time for the Premier to listen and to act. If she does not, she may face the consequences at the next state election.</span>

I was just a schoolgirl at the time and I recall, like many others, watching a black-and-white television in a crowded classroom. What we witnessed on that day was the impossible become reality. I was so captivated by the images and the sheer scale of the achievement that I too wanted to be an astronaut. Even then, I thought that women could do anything.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I've yet to experience the lofty heights of space that I dreamed of as a young child, I did get to relive some of that magic this past weekend. On Saturday the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, in my electorate, launched GIANT LEAP, a multi-arts program featuring art exhibitions, discussion panels, film screenings, astronomy nights and workshops on all things lunar. The exhibitions are a collaboration with not only the artists but also the US consulate. The exhibitions don't just focus on the moon landing but also explore humankind's relationship with the moon. One such exhibition, 'Under the Same Moon', focuses on my electorate's many diverse cultures and beliefs, and the myths and legends related to the moon. Amongst the pieces on display are works related to Chinese astrology, Aboriginal Dreamtime experiences and cultural responses to lunar eclipse and our fascination with UFOs. Another exhibition, 'Future', looks at the artworks from the fifties and the sixties and how they imagined the future—and, no, we don't have jet packs yet. A number of these works remind me of the cover art of the old science fiction novels that I spent most of my childhood lost in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was great to see several generations in attendance for Saturday's launch, including many young faces showing the same fascination and wonder that was shown back on that momentous day in human history in 1969. My congratulations to Craig and the team at CPAC and everyone involved in putting this program together. For everyone looking for a great afternoon, it's on until 11 September. I encourage everyone to get along and also sample the fare at the Bellbird Cafe, which is sublime to say the least. The powerhouse is a great part of my electorate and it has some absolutely fantastic displays and theatre productions which showcase the multicultural nature of our part of the world. I commend the powerhouse to everyone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Water is a crucial issue these days if we are to propose any form of further development of regional areas. Currently, areas in my electorate are suffering because of a lack of water infrastructure—and we must build it now. We can't prepare for this drought now—we should have prepared for this drought a decade ago—but we most certainly can learn from the lessons of right now and start building the water infrastructure for the future. I commend the government for their more deliberate stance now of pushing the states, and being able to go into the legislation and remove the impediments in such a way as we can start construction of this water infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Armidale, they said, would never have water restrictions. It is now on level 4 and about to go higher. They are talking about day zero, when we actually run out of water. In Guyra, to the north of us, they are trucking water in; I think it is 0.6 of a megalitre a day. In Morundah they are trucking in water because they are out of water. In Walcha they are moving to severe water restrictions as the Macdonald River runs dry. In Tenterfield they're trying to find bores to supplement the town's water supply, because their water is running out. This is the scenario over so many areas of New England and, no doubt, across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What it says to us is that we must now start preparing, as desperate as it might sound, for the next drought. It will rain, but when it rains is not the time to start preparing for the next drought. If there's one thing you can do in droughts, it's build water infrastructure. When there's no water in the river is the time you can build a dam, it's not when it's in flood or flowing. Understandably, there's not the political drive to build this infrastructure if there's an abundance of water about. If we had not extended the water infrastructure for Tamworth—which was one of the first things I did as the local member when I arrived there—Tamworth would have run out of water. At the time, our biggest impediment to the extension of Chaffey Dam was the Booroolong frog. Apparently this frog had to be saved for eternity. Even though its range goes from northern Victoria to southern Queensland, it was the reason we couldn't extend Chaffey Dam—and I think to this day we're probably not completely within the requirements of what they call their environmental offsets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must get a clear understanding now of what our impediments are to expediting that construction at both state and federal levels. If there is legislation, if there is regulation, it must be clearly understood and, where required, repealed so that we can get into this process. Australians, no matter what their political colour or where they are, will not tolerate a further lack of water infrastructure. </span>

For 56 years the international netball community has come together to see a world cup tournament. Obviously, there have been some fairly dominant leading nations in that competition over time—namely, New Zealand and Australia. </span>

I've spoken to a lot of people in this building who represent communities around the country about what, it has to be said, was a disappointing result for Australia—a one goal loss to New Zealand in the gold medal match. But it is interesting to note that, over 15 tournaments and 17 match-ups between Australia and New Zealand, the combined score for Australia is 759 goals; for New Zealand it is 758 goals. Firstly, we're still winning. Secondly, the competition between these two nations—in this, the ultimate team sport—is the tightest on the planet. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unique thing about the game of netball is that it is the absolute team sport. No-one can go coast to coast in netball. There is no goal to goal. There's no 'grab the ball and dribble all the way down the court'. There's no 70-metre run as you bounce the ball. No-one can go coast to coast without their team mates in netball. Netball is the ultimate team sport. </span>

I want to say too that New Zealand and Australia played one another twice within three days. The first result was Australia winning by one goal; the second result was New Zealand winning by one goal. Both games were absolutely fabulous—the most amazing netball. Both games saw teams come back hard in that second half and just get pipped and not be able to take the lead. It's an extraordinary piece of sporting history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the young Diamonds: coach, Lisa Alexander; captain, Caitlin Bassett; Liz Watson, Victorian vice-captain of the Diamonds this time; and Stephanie Wood, Gretel Tippett, Caitlin Thwaites, Jamie-Lee Price, Kelsey Browne, Paige Hadley, Joanne Weston, Courtney Bruce, April Brandley and Sarah Klau—our fabulous squad of 12. I want to finish by saying that you did shine bright, you are confident girls and you are building and empowering women and girls around this nation. I want to congratulate the International Netball Federation on a fabulous tournament. England of course were great hosts. I want to wish all of the Australian girls around the country, who will be back on the court in the super netball series this weekend, the best of luck. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I rise to speak about women's sport as well. I didn't actually catch the game, but well done to the Silver Ferns on their win and well done to the Diamonds for making the final. I'm a netball player myself; I love the sport. Ash Barty—how good's Ash Barty? I loved watching her win the French Open. I hope she goes on to win more titles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many women excelling in sport my electorate as well. From the netball courts to the world stage, Petrie has a lot of local sporting stars to be proud of. Peninsula Power Football Club has a track record as one of the strongest clubs in South-East Queensland, and that includes producing some of our nation's best female footballers and Matildas. Former Power girl Teagan Micah, who I met the other night at the opening of their new indoor training centre at the Peninsula Power Football Club on 13 July, currently plays goalkeeper for the Matildas and follows in the footsteps of a number of locals and Power girls who have worn the green and gold, including Larissa Crummer and Redcliffe's Kate McShea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Power's premier women's side has also made a name for itself as the team to beat. The women are currently gearing up for a semifinal clash in August and are eyeing off their second consecutive Elaine Watson Cup title. It helps when you've got Brittany Whitfield by your side. Brit has risen through the ranks from Power junior to play for Sydney FC, and has recently returned home and    quickly earned herself the title of the highest goalscorer in the league.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The North Lakes Blues is a great local netball club in my electorate. Its netballers are renowned on the courts. This year, 10 players aged 12 to open were selected and competed in the Pine Rivers State Age Championships and the country comp up in Bundaberg. Club president Samantha Malopito said it's great to encourage the littlies and, more and more, they are seeing women continuing to play well into their 50s. This year they had three senior teams, ranging in age from 18 through to masters, pulling on the bibs. Next year they're increasing that number to four because of the increased demand. I'm really pleased that the federal government has allocated some funding for new courts, and we need the Moreton Bay Regional Council to get on board with that as quickly as possible as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's sport is essential. I want to quickly talk about a few sporting champion grants that have been delivered. Jade Starr—I have watched her grow from a young girl into a young woman—has won the award several times. So has Alyssa Sinclair, for pony riding, as has Tanielle Botfield, who is a BMX champion. There are so many women doing great things in sport, and they are becoming real role models to younger girls. I look forward to continuing to support them through all clubs in my electorate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  How good is the failed NBN? Here we are again—a new parliament but the same old failures of this government and their deliberate butchering of the National Broadband Network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was contacted recently by the owner of a computer sales and repair business in my electorate. This business employs three local staff and relies on the internet connection as a bit of a component when working with computers. My constituent was pleased to be informed when they were advised that they could connect to the government's second-rate NBN. That should be a positive thing for an IT business, right? You'd think so. As expected, someone came out to hook it up. He was online for a total of two minutes before the connection was disrupted. The technician left in confusion, and my constituent and his business was left with no internet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the days following this 'excellent' service, this small business was left without a phone, internet or EFTPOS connection. This went on for some time until they found a temporary connection through the mobile phone network to use. This bare minimum patch-up was never going to be enough. Computer repair involves high-speed internet traffic due to heavy data usage and file transfers, so a mobile phone connection to replace the NBN is like putting a bandaid on a broken leg. When my constituent complained to NBN, he was told, 'Wait for your ISP.' The ISP said, 'No, we're waiting for the NBN'—back and forth, back and forth; buck passing and getting a gold medal in bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. Meanwhile the minister sits on his hands, ignoring their pleas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This small business is suffering unsustainable losses. Its income stream has been slashed by half and the owner has been forced to send staff home on full pay because of a lack of work. So much for the Morrison government's empty rhetoric about having a go and getting a go. You can imagine just how annoyed this small-business owner was when, eventually, another technician meandered out to have a look at the problem and it was discovered that the major cable that should go from his business's side of the street to the node 200 metres away had never, ever been installed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The complete failure of the Morrison government to give Australians first-rate broadband is unbelievable. It is creating incredible anxiety for small-business owners. My constituent has been left in the dark, which is putting pressure on his health and creating stress. He is wondering how long his business can survive without the basic necessities of proper working internet. He said to me, 'This is like trying to run a Red Rooster without any chicken.' This is another example of what we're seeing on a massive scale with this deliberately failed and botched rollout of the Liberals' version of the NBN. Small-business owners are being financially hammered to breaking point by a government that knowingly misleads Australia when it says it cares about small business and has seriously mismanaged the very things that would help businesses thrive.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I rise this afternoon to talk about Sam and Vanessa, and their family. A beautiful family in my electorate, they are the quintessential Ryan family. They live in Mitchelton and they have three beautiful kids. Like many in Australia—and in Ryan, of course—they are working their guts out to pay the bills, to help their kids and to maybe even save enough for a reno. In many ways they are 'quiet Australians'. When I met them last week in their home in Mitchelton, I spoke about how important it was that the Morrison government had got on with delivering tax relief to 10 million Australians so that they got to keep more of their money to spend on their family. In fact, over 72,000 Ryan taxpayers now have more money in their pockets to spend on their families and to spend on doing the things that they like to do. Over 26,000 residents in Ryan alone are now receiving the full tax offset of $1,080, thanks to the work of the Morrison government in just its first week in parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's about more than just the dollars and cents, isn't it? It's about the fact that we went to an election with this tax plan. It was laid out. It was fully costed in the budget. It was explained to the Australian people. In the first week after parliament came back, we kept faith with those who had put their faith in us and we delivered it for Australians. It shouldn't be overlooked that this tax relief is on top of stopping Labor's $387 billion worth of new taxes that, on 19 May, they were ready to impose on Australians if they were given the opportunity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a refrain in modern politics that people lament the lack of long-term planning or reform. Yet in the tax relief that this parliament has passed, that the Morrison government put forward, we see that long-term reform and planning writ large. It locks in, for 2024-25, reducing the tax rate from 32.5 per cent to 30 per cent, and it abolishes the 37 per cent bracket entirely. At that point, 94 per cent of Australians will pay just 30c in the dollar, so they can keep that money in their pockets and pay less tax. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say that's locked in, I mean it's locked in with the re-election of the Morrison government. That's because Labor have kept open the option of rolling it back if they get the opportunity in 2022. So, to the families of Ryan who are now enjoying more money in their pockets, the choice is still clear, isn't it? You've got the Morrison government, who are going to deliver more money into your pockets with lower taxes, and you've got the Labor Party, who are leaving open the option of rolling back the tax reform that the Morrison government has already put in place and delivering more taxes. So continue to support us and keep faith, and we'll keep faith with the quiet Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  All of us in this place rely heavily on our terrific teams, and I have an incredible electorate officer, David Ewings, who helps many hundreds of people in his role. There are some stories that really stand out for Dave; this is one of them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were recently contacted by a lady called Lynn. She is the primary carer for her sister. Lynn's sister was diagnosed with cancer last year and has since suffered two strokes, the most recent in February of this year. As a consequence of her conditions, Lynn's sister is bedridden. She needs assistance to do everyday things that most of us take for granted, like bathing, going to the toilet, preparing food and simply moving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Lynn fought to get an aged-care package, Lynn's sister was assigned a level 3—after so much argy-bargy. But this package fails to pay for nurses that provide the high level of care that her sister desperately needs. Lynn is terrified that her sister will pass away before she gets the help she needs. Lynn's sister has been described by health professionals as one of the most complex cases they have ever treated or witnessed, yet her needs aren't high enough, it would seem, to get the care that she needs. Lynn and her family have been left with little assistance and no choice. They are thousands and thousands of dollars out of pocket. On some days, Lynn's 89-year-old mother has to be Lynn's sister's primary carer because Lynn needs to go to work to be able to pay for the services that her sister should already be getting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lynn has made numerous attempts to get her sister the level 4 package, which would cover her high care needs, but it's been months, and she's still fighting. She's sent emails to the previous and present ministers for aged care and senior Australians, but every one of them has been ignored. A minister ignoring such a desperate situation is truly untenable. Today Lynn told me that she's been forced to reduce her work hours so she can care for her sister and relieve her mum of some of the responsibility in order to keep her family functioning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is indefensible that vulnerable people like Lynn's sister are waiting in limbo for assistance. They need to be adequately cared for. How has it come to this? This is an absolute travesty of aged care, and it's not just happening to Lynn and her family. This situation is being replicated in thousands of families across Australia, and this government is doing nothing about it. It had to be dragged kicking and screaming to a royal commission about aged care, and it has still done nothing. When are we going to see some decent aged care in Australia from this incompetent government?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Like many in this House, I get around to lots of activities that young people are engaged in in our communities, and they continually inspire me and, indeed, recharge my batteries when I go along and see some of these activities. Things like the Tournament of Minds, where hundreds of local students from schools all across the region participate in problem-solving activities, come to my mind. The Lego robotics competitions are a great example of science and technology providing an opportunity for young people to engage in some great activities. In particular in the last week, we have had NAIDOC celebrations, with many young people involved in those activities. They're very inspiring, and there are so many wonderful young people in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also make me very conscious of our responsibility. The member for Lilley gave a great first speech the other day about how we carry the legacy of the decisions we make in this place for the next generation. In that frame, on 10 July I had a meeting scheduled with four wonderful students from Woonona East Public School. Three of them were able to attend the meeting—Maya, Hayley and Caitlyn. Sophie had also worked with them but unfortunately was ill on the day and couldn't come along. I asked them to summarise the issues that they raised with me in a little speech for me to deliver to the parliament. This is what they have written:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our climate issues are getting out of control! Our beautiful world is darkening as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm sure you have all heard about turtles having plastic straws up their nose. How birds get stuck in plastic fruit nets and how marine creatures get struck in fishing equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a wake-up call not only for me but you as well. This is why I demand a change to not only our country but our world. We have done our research, listening to the scientists, who say that we are less than twelve years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. It is proven that we have only 125 months until everything will be irreversible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are campaigning to help the Cunningham area, such as making Wollongong plastic free. But just getting rid of plastic will only be a small baby step. We need even larger steps happening NOW around all of Australia. To slow climate change down, we need to reduce our emissions by at least 15% every year to stay below the 2 degree celsius warming target. It is proven that people below the age of 30 in today's world will be affected. This is NOT good enough. It NEEDS to change NOW.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The students spoke to me extensively about the activities they have undertaken in their own school on plastic reduction and recycling. They believe there is hope and they want us to hear their message. I'm very pleased to have been able to read part of that to the chamber today and to also acknowledge the students of Woonona High School, who have a great program of recycling and reuse happening as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I would like to expand on some comments that I made in the House earlier this week involving Australia's tourism sector, a sector that I described as forming an invaluable element of strength for our nation. Every single member in this House has an obligation to not only protect that sector but promote it. Therefore, I have called for the comments of David Attenborough two weeks ago, before a UK parliamentary inquiry, to be called out by every single member of this House. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will never forget diving on the [Great Barrier] reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms of life, that it was stark white, it had bleached white …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That message, broadcast around the world, tells potential tourists to Australia: 'Don't bother coming to the Great Barrier Reef, because it is stark white. It is bleached white.' But David Attenborough forgot to tell that committee that four years ago he actually filmed a documentary on the Great Barrier Reef which described it as 'the perfect coral reef' and in which he filmed and documented the Great Barrier Reef in all its magnificent colour and wonders. When he promoted that film back in December 2015—remember, that's four years ago—he described Australia's Great Barrier Reef as 'fantastic', 'breathtaking' and 'a dream'. Yet now he sits before a UK parliamentary committee and creates the impression that it is all stark white, that it is all bleached white.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one denies that parts of the reef are damaged from time to time by cyclones and coral bleaching. The science tells us that this has been happening for hundreds of years. But, today, the reef remains in good shape. It's a great place for Australians and for visitors from around the world to come and visit. But the sector is currently struggling. We have seen Cathay Pacific announce that they are pulling out of Cairns. That is four flights a week lost from Hong Kong into Cairns. That will hurt every citizen who lives in Cairns, from the people involved in transport, cafes and restaurants to the people cleaning motels and hotels. Sir David Attenborough should apologise. He should apologise for misleading that UK parliamentary inquiry, he should apologise to the Australian people and he should apologise to the people of Cairns, who will be hurt by his reckless and misleading comments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise today to recognise two amazing young women from my electorate: Aleeyah Clifford and Ruby Hackett. After taking part in a powerful pro-choice rally in Sydney in June, Aleeyah and Ruby wanted to keep the issue and momentum going locally, so, despite being only 16 years old, they set out on the ambitious task of staging their own reproductive health rights rally in Newcastle under the banner Our Body Our Choice. Shamefully, it is New South Wales that has the most draconian abortion laws in the country, which still criminalise women who access abortion and health practitioners who perform or assist in a procedure with a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment. The fact that in 2019 abortion should still be in the Criminal Code is an outrage. It is sexist, it is damaging and it particularly hurts women in poorer areas and marginalised communities. Abortion is not a crime; it is a health issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aleeyah and Ruby should be congratulated for doing their bit to keep the pressure for change on the New South Wales government. The rally was a great community event. It saw hundreds of people from across the city come together in solidarity for women's reproductive health rights. This has been a long fight. For me personally it is a campaign that has now spanned more than three decades. Whilst there is no doubt that we've come a long way during that time, there will always be a place, as we see in the case of the New South Wales laws, for strong, capable women like Aleeyah and Ruby, who, when faced with an injustice, don't just stay quiet; they get out there, they get organised and they drive change. I take this opportunity in parliament to pay tribute to Ruby, Aleeyah and all of the other courageous women, past and present and emerging, who have championed women's reproductive health rights over so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that is profoundly important to me as the national co-convener of EMILY's List Australia, a feminist organisation that supports progressive pro-choice women into parliament. There are now more than 100 EMILY's List members sitting in parliaments across the country—Labor women who are all committed to driving strong reproductive rights policies and legislative reform. While that's an achievement certainly worth celebrating, we know that there is still so much work to do. Every single one of us should have the freedom to decide what is right for our bodies and lives. Women should have access to safe, affordable, reliable reproductive health services. I thank Aleeyah and Ruby, and all the fabulous women and supportive men who took part in Sunday's march, for their ongoing determination and advocacy to ensure that reproductive health in Australia is delivering for every woman regardless of where she lives.</span>

The recent Queen's Birthday honours included some amazing role models who live and work in my electorate of Brisbane. The irrepressible Li Cunxin has been recognised as an Officer in the General Division for his distinguished service to the performing arts. Queensland Ballet has gone from strength to strength under his leadership. Also recognised as an Officer in the General Division is Graeme Turner from UQ for his distinguished service to higher education through pioneering work in cultural studies and the humanities.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I rise to speak about the abandonment of regional Australia by this federal government. In particular, I will speak from my experiences and the lived reality of people in the Top End—in Darwin, Palmerston and the Territory more broadly—in the hope that bringing this set of circumstances to the attention of the parliament might spur some action from the federal government to address it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday in the House of Representatives we saw a former Deputy Prime Minister stand up in the main chamber and criticise members of the Senate for not spending enough time in regional Australia. It's easy for governments to forget about the regions, and it can be seen that in many ways this federal government is certainly taking the easy path, particularly when it comes to not investing and not spending funds that are required to build our nation. Have a look at the lack of funding for regional, road, rail and port infrastructure through the Building Australia Fund; it's a case in point. But also look at the unfair cap on university places, which places a massive burden on our regional universities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charles Darwin University is the only university in the Northern Territory. It's been crippled by the coalition's freeze on university places, losing around $30 million of federal funding as a consequence. Some of the larger sandstone universities in the large capitals—Sydney and Melbourne—might be able to cope with this university place capping. But it was because of the effect the cap has on regional universities, in particular, that when we were in office Labor lifted the cap on the number of university places. That opened the door to thousands of students around the country, including in regional areas. There are young Territorians who would never have had the opportunity to go to university if not for the lifting of those caps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the federal government's cap prevents regional universities like CDU from growing, and it blocks prospective students' access to tertiary education across the Territory. It's estimated more than 1,200 Territorians could miss out on a place at university over the next decade because of this cap. By not lifting the cap, the Morrison government continues to put university out of reach for young Territorians. Another area of concern for Territorians is the flow-on effect for vocational education and training. Currently, it looks like Charles Darwin University may also lose up to 100 jobs. So staff jobs are on the line as well because of the capping of these university places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness is also a massive concern for Territorians, with the highest rates of homelessness in the country. Most of those suffering are older women and young people who have become socially disconnected or disconnected from family. And yet the Northern Territory receives the least amount per capita of funding support from the federal government; try and work that out. I could barely believe it when I recently heard that the Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services's solution was to put 'a positive spin' on homelessness! Try telling that to people on the frontline, like Fran Avon from the St Vincent de Paul Society NT. Her organisation is having to turn away six callers a day because of funding constraints, and people are having to wait six weeks for emergency accommodation. So, if the federal minister is interested in making a positive contribution to addressing homelessness around the country, he could take a look at the current funding structure for homeless people, which is disadvantaging the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This federal government, the Morrison government, cannot continue to ignore the housing affordability crisis which is gripping the country, because it's forcing more people into homelessness. I know that this is not on purpose; the federal government are not trying to force people into homelessness. However, they must look at the policies they have. And ignoring the problem is not a solution. It's not a solution for broken families who cannot pay the rent, for those who are feeling lost and abandoned or for those on the streets whose minds have been touched by illness or whose bodies are sorely affected by disabilities. Ignoring the problem of homelessness we have in our country is not a solution. I can say to honourable members: if you want to get a sobering view of the homelessness crisis in our country, come up to Darwin and I will show you what a lack of federal support does to people living rough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise, either, that Territory businesses are frustrated at the sluggish delivery of the infrastructure spend. They are also very frustrated at some other issues—issues that are driving crime, as one example. When it comes to infrastructure, the Territory business community know what they were promised. As to defence spending on infrastructure, the delay in those infrastructure packages has become a problem. Before the election, the federal government said that infrastructure packages would start before the end of 2019. But since then we haven't heard a thing. There are some months to go, so we're looking forward to hearing some news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says it believes in regionalisation—in bringing government services closer to the people they serve. However, talking is easy. We want to see the regionalisation rhetoric become a reality. They are worthy sentiments, but let's look at what is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to supporting regional areas—particularly regional areas of low population—the Australian Public Service is an important employer. At the moment, Territorians are being denied the services that they need and deserve, and we have seen, over the past six years of coalition government, a 26 per cent cut in the number of Commonwealth Public Service jobs in the NT. That's 695 people, which is a lot of people when you've got a relatively small population, as we have in Darwin. When we look at permanent positions, it's an even bigger figure: 32 per cent of permanent positions, or 713 people, have been cut. So, when we look at departments and agencies that have received cuts to their staffing, services have become very hard for Territorians to access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Department of Defence, 62 positions have been lost; in Defence Housing, eight positions have been lost; in the Department of Education, four positions, or 25 per cent, have been lost; in the Department of Health, we've seen a loss of 65 per cent in Commonwealth Public Service positions; in Human Services, Centrelink and the like, there have been 74 positions cut; in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, 23 per cent of positions have been cut; in Aboriginal Hostels, there's been a cut of 10 per cent; in the Bureau of Meteorology, there's been a cut of 16 per cent; and in the ATO, there's been a cut of 100 per cent. That's right; there is no-one left to assist Territorians face to face when it comes to the Taxation Office. Then we have the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities. They've lost positions. The Fair Work Commission has also lost positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking about the different sectors of our Public Service that have lost positions, I have laboured the point that it's easy for someone down in the federal government to direct the Public Service to find cuts to the Public Service. But, when it hits places like the Northern Territory, it hurts. It hurts not only because our people living a long way away from Canberra or from the main cities have to deal with not having the services that every other Australian has; it also hurts our economy because of the smaller population. I want to see the coalition government start to invest in regional Australia and invest in the Territory.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="203092" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  This is the first opportunity I've had to speak in the parliament since the general election on 18 May, and I want to use this occasion to,firstly, thank the voters of North Sydney for giving me the incredible honour of continuing my service in this parliament. I stood at that election with what I think was a very positive platform and record about this government's contribution towards the community of North Sydney, which has been my home for almost 20 years and is very dear to my heart. During that campaign I was able to highlight the considerable support and achievements of the government in improving the quality of living standards that exist in our part of the world. We do live in a spectacular part of Sydney, bordered, as we are, by the harbour and the Lane Cove River, and Middle Harbour a little bit further to the north, and we are home to some of the most vibrant and multicultural communities that our city has to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to highlight to residents our work in delivering better sporting facilities, including the wonderful sporting precinct redevelopment at Gore Hill, projects like those at Bedlam Bay, support for rebuilding the much-loved Lane Cove Pool, and other projects across the electorate: our increased funding for local schools and increased funding for health facilities, including record funding for the Royal North Shore Hospital, which is obviously the major hospital in my community; our support for local community groups, particularly voluntary organisations, who do such an amazing job; and the funding I've been able to secure for solar panels to support those that are trying to make sure that they're supporting our actions to reduce climate emissions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going into the election, I was particularly proud of the fact that I was able to secure commitments from the government for two important projects which will be fully implemented in this term. The first of those is a $10 million commitment that we've made to support North Sydney Council to rebuild the beautiful and historic North Sydney Olympic Pool. For those of you from outside Sydney, North Sydney Olympic Pool is one of the nation's most iconic. It was built for the Empire Games in the 1930s. It is listed—how you measure these things, I'm not quite sure—as one of the 10 most photographed swimming pools in the world for Instagram. Sitting as it does beside Luna Park and the Harbour Bridge with its beautiful art deco architecture, it is a special place. Unfortunately, it's showing its age and risks significant failure, which could see it close. This commitment from the federal government, which I hope in due course will be matched by the state government, will allow North Sydney Council to make sure that the pool has a long-lasting and permanent role in the life of Sydney and our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other commitment I was and am very proud of is one that continues the work that I've been undertaking to make sure that the former submarine base, Platypus—now known as Sub Base Platypus—is converted into a wonderful community asset. Platypus sits on Neutral Bay, beside the harbour. With funding already secured, it is now, for the first time in living memory, open permanently to the public. In the budget we committed another $10 million or thereabouts to continue the work to make a open-space parkland along the harbour, but also a precinct that is vibrant and exciting. I look forward to working with the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to ensure that that process continues and is completed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to represent the North Sydney community, and I was thrilled to be re-elected on 18 May. I've given my community the commitment that I will continue to work exceptionally hard for them over the three years ahead. I want to reflect briefly on the election campaign itself. I have to say that in North Sydney—perhaps reflecting the fact that it wasn't deemed by other parties to be a marginal seat—the campaign was exceptionally civilised and friendly, as, in my view, it should be. I suspect just across the border in Warringah there was a slightly different experience. So I wanted to, firstly, thank the six other candidates that stood in North Sydney for ensuring that we had a campaign that was so civilised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Various candidates participated in the campaign to various degrees, but I did want to particularly acknowledge Brett Stone, the Labor candidate, and Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, who on this occasion was an Independent candidate. Arthur, who I know well, is one of those people who—like one of my predecessors, Billy Hughes—has tried a range of parties. He actually started in the Young Liberals. Then he was a member of the Australian Democrats in the New South Wales parliament, before joining the Greens, and on this occasion he stood as an Independent. I'm told—but haven't confirmed it—that this was probably his last bid for parliament. I want to thank him for his participation. I also acknowledge and thank all of the other candidates who stood during the campaign, and all their volunteers. It is wonderful when you can go to pre-poll and polling booths and actually have an enjoyable experience working and talking to the other candidates and their supporters. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect briefly on one aspect of the campaign that I haven't reflected on publicly before, and that is, for me, the most difficult and the saddest part of the campaign. But it also emphasised how important our democracy is. As some of you may know, an elderly couple, voting for the first time in Australia, left the pre-poll centre in Crows Nest, and the wife of this couple, Mrs Maharaj, was in an appalling accident in which she was, very tragically, killed by a cement truck. Unfortunately, I was there when this accident occurred. It's fair to say that, for all of the polling booth workers there, it was a very, very difficult and emotional day. I raise it because I had spoken to them on their way into pre-poll. I had helped present their citizenship a few months before. They were a beautiful couple in their 80s who had migrated from Fiji; they were of Fijian-Indian heritage. And what was so wonderful was that they were just so excited about voting for the first time in an Australian federal election. The fact that that experience ended the way it did is something that our community will regret for a very long time to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by thanking those who supported my campaign. I had a large team of supporters, as you'd expect, and I particularly want to thank my FEC president, Gail Giles-Gidney, my campaign manager, Pamela McClelland, and all of those who supported our efforts both before and on polling day. The member for Gellibrand yesterday managed to read a list of, I think, every single volunteer that he had on his campaign, which I thought was a bit ridiculous. But then I thought, 'Well, if he can do it, I can as well.' I'm not going to read the name of every volunteer because I would need an extension of time, but I do want to thank all of those booth captains. I should start by acknowledging Mary and Greg Blainey, Bob Lawrence and Iain Bartholemew, the Zhu family, those in the Armenian and Chinese communities that supported me. I want to thank campaign booth captains like Aldina at Mowbray, Scott Benison at Lane Cove, Carrington in Chatswood, David in North Sydney, Councillor David Brooks-Horn at Lane Cove Public School, Councillor Ben Collins at Boronia Park, Greg Curie Dupont, Mark at Chatswood, Hugh and Victoria Eriksson at Castlecrag, Alex at Naremburn, Helen at Northbridge, Andrew at North Sydney Girls, Chris at Chatswood, Bill at Cammeray, Liz at Anzac Park Public School, Andrew at McMahon's Point, Mary at Northbridge, Matthew at North Sydney, Bob at Chatswood High, Barry at St Aloysius College, John at Lane Cove Council, Vince at St Mark's Church, John at Greenwich Public School, Max at Northbridge, Councillor Zac Miles at Hunters Hill Public School, John and Paul at Cammeraygal High School, Bill at Chatswood High School, Paul at St Michael's Lane Cove, Justin at Greenwich Public School, Gaurav at Lane Cove West, Karen and Alastair at Cammeray Golf Club, Tom at St Peter's in Cremorne, Stuart at St Andrew's Uniting Church, Hamish at Artarmon Community Centre, Councillor Christine Tuon at Artarmon Public School, Councillor Brendon Zhu at Dougherty Community Centre—and I particularly thank his parents Jackie and Irene for their work on pre-poll—Lisette at Waverton Uniting Church, Angelo at Willoughby Public School, and Tim, Trevor and Brian at Willoughby Park and Willoughby Uniting Church. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank my staff and the volunteers who worked in my office during the campaign. They put in that extra mile. Many of them were former staff who were coming back to volunteer or work part time. I particularly thank my team led by Flynn McDermott, including Nikki, Mitchell, Jack, Lachlan, Sinclair, Alex, Laura, James, Melina, Leona, Riley, Hunter, Brendon and Nick, who all did an outstanding job. Election campaigns are times of the political cycle that I love, because it is a unique opportunity to meet those who really determine the success of our democracy. I thank all residents in North Sydney for their participation in the general election.</span>

Well, that's what it's supposed to be. It's not supposed to make things more difficult or cause stress to participants.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are deliberately underfunding the NDIS, especially around staff, so they can prop up their budget position. They're doing this at the expense of my constituents with disability. Where the NDIS has been successful, it has had incredible results for those Australians who need it. When it works, it allows people to live fulfilling lives and participate in their communities. However, we've heard, time and time again in this chamber, the personal stories of those whom the NDIS has failed. It's a repeat story. Members have stood here and explained the shocking stories of their constituents who are without funding, without assistive technology and unable to get clarity on their plans. The stories are shocking but, sadly, all too familiar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my constituents is a quadruple amputee. He had an NDIS annual review in August 2018 and had no funding for assistive technology in that plan. He sent a request for the AT just before Christmas last year and gave the required quotes, justifications and reports. He requires funding for two AT items. The first is replacement sockets, liners and sleeves for his prosthetic legs, because his prosthetics no longer fit correctly. This means it's dangerous for him to move around. He also needs domestic prosthetics that he can put on by himself to go to the bathroom at night or for any emergencies. The issue here is that the bathroom modifications that were done to apparent NDIS specifications do not allow him to use a standard commode, and the higher commode is too dangerous for him to use without the domestic prosthetics. Despite this, he still manages to work three days a week, relying on his prosthetics to be able to do his job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January he came to my office as he had received no response to his application for AT. When I inquired with the NDIS as to where his application was at, the answer I received was that the request from the occupational therapist had been sitting unactioned for months. It took until March before his plan was reinstated and his funding restarted. </span>

                  <a href="265990" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms STANLEY:</span>
                  </a>  As I was saying, I've written to the minister about the issue of assistive technologies. In that letter I made it clear that requests are not being actioned within a reasonable time frame. Many of my constituents have been waiting for well over 12 months for their AT requests to be approved. These are essential pieces of equipment. They are required for their everyday lives—items like hearing aids, prosthetic limbs and car modification for wheelchair transport. There's no point in having a wheelchair if you can't get it in a car. My constituents are suffering every day whilst they wait, often with little or no communication from the NDIA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To add further stress, the quotes the NDIA are providing are only valid for three months; however, the AT requests are not reviewed by the NDIS within that time period. This leaves my constituents having to arrange new quotes every three months—a time-consuming, frustrating and stressful exercise. The majority of my constituents do not have a funded support coordinator, so they rely on themselves to arrange quotes during their spare time. Anyone who knows knows that is very little. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents have also told me about the serious issue of the funds for their AT requirements, which have been discussed at review, not being included in their plans. Local support coordinators have told me that, ideally, funding for AT should be included as an approved, stated item in the plan. Requests for reviews are taking excessive time to process. According to reports from my constituents, often it takes six to nine months for the review to be actioned. Whilst this is an extremely long time, we need to note that, after nine months without action by the NDIS, the request is considered null and my constituents are forced to wait three months for the planned annual review. This makes submitting a review request completely redundant—another time-consuming and frustrating exercise. During this time period, my constituents are often using their funding as they feel necessary. As the review request takes so long to be actioned, they're depleting their approved funding. It is a dangerous game to be forced to play, as there is often no visibility of when or where their request will be actioned. They may even run out of funding. Put yourself in their position: imagine running out of funding and having no visibility or knowledge of when you might receive further funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only have I had a number of constituents come to me about their own personal struggles with the NDIS; there are those who have come to me regarding their children. One of those mothers came to me about her 19-year-old son. In August 2018 she requested an urgent review of his plan, to include specialist psychological services. She was contacted by the NDIA and given an email address if she needed support, as her son is considered 'priority at-risk'. With no clarity about his care, and his needed psychological support services not forthcoming, all this mother was given was an email address if urgent help was needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another mother came to me about her son who's 11 years old and has ROHHAD syndrome. This is rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysregulation, hypoventilation and autonomic dysregulation. It's a rare, life-threatening syndrome. It means that the system which controls necessary life functions, such as breathing and heartbeat, is affected. This 11-year-old boy requires a ventilator. He has severe behavioural issues and often detaches himself from his ventilator. His mobility is rapidly decreasing and he's now housebound. It's too dangerous to take him outside or manoeuvre him in a car without modifications. He can't attend school or medical appointments. His application had been under review since June 2017 when his mother came to me in August 2018. It had been 14 months, and this boy still had no answer on funding from the NDIA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a case of a mother of a 12-year-old boy with Down syndrome. They came to me last year as their funds were running low and they didn't know where to turn. She told me she received a call from an NDIS rep, who effectively told her that she should be caring for her son at home and not working fulltime or, if she couldn't, maybe her 16-year-old daughter could take on that job. This is an absolute disgrace. For the NDIA to tell a mother to go home and be a full-time carer or to put the responsibility on a teenager is sickening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also been working with one other family over the last year. They came to me because they were having trouble getting their reviews dealt with and actioned in a timely manner. Mr and Mrs Hew have two severely disabled young adult children. He and his wife are their carers, with support from various NDIS providers. After finally getting the reviews and plans in place, the family was satisfied they could meet the needs of their loved ones. Unfortunately, a month ago, their major service provider wrote to them to tell them that, with no warning, they were no longer going to provide services to the family and that they had three months to find new services. Obviously, given the significant major needs of this family, this caused an amazing amount of stress. Mr Hew attributes his heart attack and subsequent surgery to the stress caused. He and his family are still trying to find new support services before the service is withdrawn. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a moment to consider the chronic underfunding that is causing people with disabilities to go without much needed AT and services and cause stress to their already challenging situation. The government slashed services and stripped $1.6 billion to achieve their surplus. They are so focused on the word 'surplus' that they forget about the people who are in need, where that $1.6 billion could easily be spent. Boasting about a surplus when they are achieving it because of drastic cuts—as children don't get the help they need, parents are being told to stay home and teenagers are being told to care for siblings—is just appalling. Australians with disability are waiting in administrative limbo as a result of those same budget cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't take away funding for Australians with disabilities and forget about the long-term needs of one of the most disadvantaged groups in our society. How well our society functions depends on how we act with each other and how we look after the people who need help. I am constantly seeing and hearing about the impact of this in my electorate. The impact is on real people, real families and real carers. They come to me because they are in a state of despair and have nowhere else to go. The government and the minister must fix this systematic lack of resourcing and deliver the desperately needed services that are part of our bipartisan agreement. The people of Werriwa and I won't stand for another three years of neglect.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I rise this evening to speak in this place about a matter that is very close to my heart, and I suspect the same can be said for every member in this chamber. Mental health affects all of us, whether it is personally, through a family member, through a loved one or through a friend. We've all got a story. We never really know what someone may be dealing with on the inside or what challenges they may be facing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Dog Institute estimates that one in five Australians aged between 16 and 65 will face a challenge with mental health in any given year, with young Australians facing more mental health challenges than any other age group. Every day, at least six Australians die by suicide. This is an extraordinary and terrifying statistic, because this means that families around Australia, families in my community and my own family deal with the constant unrelenting grief of having lost somebody who was loved, who was known, who belonged to them and who was their person. Thirty years ago I lost my aunt. Two years ago I lost my beautiful cousin. I'm not alone in this story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the reason I'm raising this topic here tonight is that there is a tragic story around mental health in my electorate, particularly on suicide and youth suicide, unfortunately, among too many young people on the Central Coast. Far too many people battle, oftentimes silently, with their own challenges. It saddens me to inform the House that suicide rates on the Central Coast are 50 per cent above the average rates in New South Wales. Data sourced from HealthStats NSW indicates that 2016 saw the highest recorded rates of suicide on the Central Coast. Sadly, rates of suicide in our local health district are increasing. This is tragic. I know that, for our community, it's not something we're proud of and that it is something we are all trying to work together to solve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to point out that we've got an amazing group of primary healthcare providers and local organisations that do an incredible job for our community. The story on the Central Coast is a story where people are bandying together to make sure that there is a pathway for young people. The Central Coast Local Health District, the Brisbane Waters Local Area Command, Central Coast Primary Care, the Iris Foundation, headspace, Suicide Prevention Central Coast, Top Blokes Foundation, Save Our Kids—led by Gosford North Rotary Club—and Trek4Vets are just some of the organisations that are doing some amazing work on the Central Coast. There are plenty more, all committed to addressing this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would like to say is that we do know that this issue is something we need to continue to work on together. I think members on both sides would agree that this is an issue that we as a community and as a parliament need to focus on, because, as the Prime Minister has said, people matter and you matter. I think this is what has led many of us here to serve in this place. It's a big part of what drives us in our service and our representation of our communities. I know I won't be alone in this experience, but I've heard far too many tragic stories of families and communities that have been devastated by the impact of struggles with mental health and, particularly, suicide. I've heard stories of young people at local schools devastated by the loss of their peers and grappling with really tough questions about their own mental health. I've heard too many stories about young men on the Central Coast who tragically felt a sense of hopelessness and felt that they didn't really belong anywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a call-out to Dan Villalard, an amazing young man in our community. In his honour, a beautiful place called Dan's Place has been set up at a local church organisation called Generatione Ministries. My parents have been longstanding pastors there and it is their hope that, through Dan's Place, in honour of Dan Villalard, there can be a sense of belonging, of community, of inclusion and of hope. For young people, and young men in particular, we know it can be hard to know where to turn to, who to turn to or even how to start talking about the challenges that people are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who did suffer very greatly as a result of very severe and sustained workplace bullying in my early 20s, I know the importance of being able to reach out early and I know how difficult it can actually be to do so. We are fortunate to have services such as Lifeline that can offer anyone experiencing a personal crisis with access to 24-hour support and suicide prevention services. But this sense of a disconnection or a lack of belonging is, for me, an important part of the conversation around health, mental health and suicide and, most importantly, keeping our community safe and well. To me, it's about bringing people together to remind them of their worth and their value and to help all of us feel more connected to those people around us. To that end, I will be convening a roundtable to look at addressing this particular issue locally to see what more we might be able to do by working together and connecting together. We'll be inviting the Minister for Health, the Hon. Greg Hunt, to come up and hear firsthand from those people on the frontline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This need for inclusion and belonging is part of the reason I advocated so strongly for a local project in Umina Beach called the Peninsula Recreation Precinct, championed by local community group the Umina Community Group. The concept of the precinct, at its core, is not just about a skate park or better infrastructure for young people; it's about helping to create meaningful connections in our community. It's about connecting the young kids at the skate park with the older generation at the men's shed, the PCYC and the local sport clubs, and it's about having a place that helps to develop those meaningful community connections that make people feel like they belong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be part of a government that backed this project with an $8.25 million commitment announced during the election. I'm proud to be part of a government that is taking action on these issues that we all face, and I want to commend the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health for their leadership and for the measures that they've recently announced, including the $500 million Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan and also the $1.45 billion to primary health networks to enable them to deliver projects that are tailored and targeted to the needs of the local area. I'm really looking forward to continuing to work with the Central Coast, Hunter and New England primary health network on this really important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Robertson, I was also pleased to be able to announce $13 million for the establishment of a residential centre for the treatment of eating disorders. Having referred earlier to a family member who, tragically, passed away aged in her 20s, I know how challenging the battle of eating disorders can be for not only those individuals but the families that they affect for years and for decades. This centre will provide much-needed services for those affected by these devastating conditions, and it'll change the way eating disorders are diagnosed and treated by providing 24/7 intensive care and support as well as training, education and advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also delivering funding for a unique homelessness outreach program, 'health on the streets', designed to take health care, including mental health care, to those on the Central Coast who are sleeping rough. This program is about taking primary care to where it's needed most and focusing on the individual and their particular issues and challenges, where they are. But there is a lot more to do. I think we can all agree, through our own experiences or through a connection with family and friends, that this is a very complex issue with complex solutions. We know there's no quick fix; there's no silver bullet. It really is something that is all of our problem to help solve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm fortunate enough to be serving here in this place now for my third term, and I want to place on the record my commitment to people on the Central Coast to work alongside our community to make this a priority in my electorate, and to take positive steps on this issue, bit by bit, day by day, month by month and year by year. I want to see those devastating figures reduced, and soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, when speaking at the Stand Tall event in Sydney, the Prime Minister asked young people in the audience to do something that really struck me. He asked every single member of the audience to turn to people on either side of them and just tell them that they mattered. This was such an important reminder to me—that something quite small, like this, can actually make a huge difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to finish by saying to somebody out there who might be listening, who might be struggling, who might need to hear this: 'You matter. People matter. Every person matters.' And my commitment this term is to do everything I can to champion in our community a greater sense of belonging, of inclusion, of connection to community, for every single person in our electorate, and to champion programs that may enable that, but, most importantly to be a champion of people and of their needs, their concerns, their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations and their value.</span>
