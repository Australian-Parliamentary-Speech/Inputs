        What is important about his election is the Labor Party's renewal. The Labor Party has continued to change and renew itself in office. This is always difficult for a major party to do because most parties refurbish themselves—change their membership, change their personnel—out of office. The Labor Party is doing it in office. The usefulness and energy of the government is being compounded by the change from experienced members who have served as ministers, many of them for a decade, and then gone back to private life, to people of similar calibre who, with experience, will serve the country, the government and the Labor Party well. I congratulate Mark Latham, his family and his supporters on a very strong and convincing victory.

        The bill will give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the chemical weapons convention, CWC, and will provide a legislative basis for its national implementation. Australia signed the convention when it opened for signature on 13 January 1993 and will ratify the convention after the enactment of this legislation. The convention will enter into force 180 days after the 65th ratification, but not before 13 January 1995. Although only four of the 154 signatories have yet ratified the convention, many others are preparing for ratification and implementation.

         Australia was instrumental in accelerating the final negotiations and bringing negotiations on the convention to a successful conclusion in 1992. That event marked a significant turning point in international efforts to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. For the first time the global community agreed to ban completely a whole category of weapons of mass destruction, require the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and their production facilities, and provide an effective mechanism to verify compliance with the convention.

         The convention is the most intrusive global instrument yet developed through the United Nations system, not only requiring state parties to make annual declarations on the production and use of certain chemicals but also to subject facilities which produce or use those chemicals above specified thresholds to routine inspections by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the CWC's permanent body in the Hague. Any state party also has the right to request the organisation to conduct a challenge inspection of any place within the territory of another state party if it has reason to suspect that the other state party may not be acting in compliance with the convention. A state party has no right to refuse such an inspection.

         The intrusive nature of the convention's verification regime is essential for building confidence in the convention itself. It will provide a means by which allegations or suspicions of non-compliance on the part of a state party may be clarified. Where suspicions are not clarified, supplier countries have resorted to denying those engaged in suspicious activities with precursor chemicals and equipment and technology needed to develop a chemical weapons program, even though such goods may be for quite legitimate purposes.

         As required by the convention, this bill, in clause 12, makes it an offence to develop, acquire, stockpile, retain, transfer or use chemical weapons. It will also be an offence for anyone in Australia or the external territories, or any Australian citizen overseas, to assist, encourage or induce any other person to engage in any activity prohibited to a state party under the convention.

         The chemicals which pose the greatest risk to the convention are contained in three schedules attached to the convention. Facilities which produce or use these chemicals above specified thresholds have to be declared to the organisation. The facility operators will also be required under this legislation to provide information for Australia's declarations to the organisation and will be subject to routine inspection by the organisation. Access to facilities for national or international compliance inspection purposes will be effected by consent of the operator or by a warrant issued by a magistrate. Trial inspections held in Australia and overseas have shown that such inspections cause minimal disruption to commercial operations.

         Both the convention and this legislation contain confidentiality provisions to protect the integrity of information gained during any activity related to the convention. The bill also covers the convention's provision for managed access by international inspectors to facilities where there is sensitive chemical technology or other information unrelated to chemical weapons. Managed access does not weaken the inspection process but is an added measure of protection for the confidentiality of commercial or national security interests.

         The bill provides for a permit system for declared facilities producing or using scheduled chemicals. The permit system will be the legal framework to facilitate the collection of information for Australia's annual declarations. The permits will be issued by the minister and may be renewed, transferred or revoked. Conditions relating to Australia's obligations under the convention will be attached to the permits. Ministerial decisions relating to permits will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

         The permit system will be administered by the Chemical Weapons Convention Office, which will be established as a non-statutory unit within an organisation in the minister's portfolio. The office will engage national inspectors, who will have inspection powers to verify that declared facilities are complying with the legislation. Other chemical production facilities, which produce un-scheduled discrete organic chemicals above specified thresholds, will be required to notify the chemical weapons convention office at the end of each year of their production levels of those chemicals, for inclusion in Australia's annual declarations. These facilities were included in the convention's verification regime because they are capable of being used in support of a chemical weapons production program. They will not, however, be subject to international inspection for at least three years after the convention's entry into force.

         The convention underwent a 20-year period of gestation. In the changing world resulting from the end of the Cold War, it is important for the convention to enter into force as early as possible, and that as many states as possible be encouraged to ratify it before that time. With the introduction of this legislation into the parliament, Australia will be setting an example for other states, particularly those in our region, to follow. We are also continuing to assist regional states, under the chemical weapons regional initiative, with their implementation of the convention. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

         As I said earlier, the coalition fully supports the bill. This bill rightly makes it an offence in Australia to develop, acquire, stockpile, retain, transfer or use chemical weapons, or to assist, encourage or induce any other person to do so. It is a worthy measure. Passage of this legislation will provide a basis for implementation of Australia's obligations under the chemical weapons convention, the first treaty in history to ban an entire category of weapons which surely figure among the most abhorrent and horrific of all weapons of mass destruction.

         Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—be they chemical, biological or nuclear—and the missile systems capable of delivering such weapons has been one of the most threatening developments of our age. Unlike nuclear and biological weapons, chemical weapons have actually been used in very recent times. Their mass casualty and disfiguration effects have made them particularly feared, and concerns that any country may have embarked on a chemical weapons program have encouraged others to consider the development of matching deterrent capabilities.

         The need for a global convention to counter this risk was formally recognised by the United Nations in 1968, but unfortunately negotiations were slowed down by the obvious constraint of the Cold War. The achievement now embodied in this convention gives us renewed hope and reassurance for our future security. The convention had its genesis in the UN conference on disarmament, aiming to improve upon the 1925 Geneva protocol which outlawed the use but not the possession of chemical weapons. The limits and inadequacies of the Geneva protocol were vividly demonstrated by Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the 1980s, both against Iran and its own Kurdish population.

         The protocol also did nothing to prevent the ongoing stockpiling by the two super powers of tens of thousands of tonnes of nerve gas and mustard gas, nor to prevent the implicit threat of destabilisation that this entailed for international security. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the signing of the chemical weapons convention in January 1993 represented a milestone in global disarmament efforts. It is my hope and the hope of the opposition that, when the convention enters into force, it will be able to oversight eventual complete elimination of chemical weapons. That is our hope. But there are very considerable tasks ahead, including in the lead-up to ratification of the convention and its entry into force. I will return to these issues in a moment.

         The fact is that Australia was at the forefront throughout the negotiations for the convention. It was not just this government that was involved and that is why we should say Australia. This government indicated publicly its determination to work to bring this convention to fruition and for that it is deserving of congratulation. Australia—this government and others—has been at the forefront in debating the issue for many years and now we are at the forefront in debating the issue in the parliament today. The cross-party support that this legislation has received in the parliament means we will be amongst the first of the nations signing to actually ratify the convention. Hopefully, this will set an example throughout the region. I would like to add my voice to those urging our regional neighbours, and indeed all other signatories, to ratify the convention at the earliest possible opportunity. It is also my hope that global disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention can provide an overarching global umbrella under which regional security talks, which are now emerging as a new focus of diplomatic efforts in the Asia-Pacific region, can take firmer root.

In this sense, ratification of the chemical weapons convention by all signatory countries in the region should help clarify and simplify the task of establishing a workable and productive regional security dialogue.

         I also want to acknowledge the constructive contribution which has been made by the Australian chemical industry. The bill necessarily implies, and provides for explicitly and implicitly, some new controls on, and hence some new inconvenience for, a number of Australian chemical companies. I hope, of course, that the government will be conscious, in implementing the permit system under the legislation, of the need to avoid any unnecessary burden on industry. But the industry itself has been firmly supportive of Australia's participation in the chemical weapons convention and has, I believe, displayed a genuine sense of proper corporate social responsibility. This cooperative stance deserves the full recognition of the parliament. I also note that entry into force of the convention has some potential to bring improved predictability to international trade in chemicals, because obviously the larger the number of ratifying countries, the fewer the prohibitions which will be required on trade with non-signatory countries.

It is not my intention to be critical of the convention—I have already indicated the opposition's support for it and my congratulations on the effort that has gone into it on Australia's behalf—but it would be foolhardy not to understand and accept its limitations and to work for improvement.

         The convention has received widespread support. To date, 154 countries have signed the convention. But some countries have not signed, and some of those countries that have not signed are unlikely to sign. The coalition is especially concerned about the lack of support the convention is receiving from a certain handful of countries which would seem to be among those most likely to be interested in possessing, or which indeed already possess, chemical weapons. About 20 states are believed to possess chemical weapons. Many of them will not sign or ratify the convention.

         I emphasise that chemical weapons are not difficult to make, nor are they difficult to hide. Iraq's chemical weapons program, discovered after the Gulf War, demonstrates the ease with which states can develop and, indeed, conceal huge chemical weapons arsenals. Iraq has declared, for example, 140,000 chemical weapons, 600 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent and 3,500 tonnes of precursor stock to United Nations inspectors, but it remains unclear whether this represents the total stockpile. Without the cooperation of the country concerned, it will be very difficult to ensure compliance with the convention, whether that country is a signatory or not. There are limits, therefore, to the enforcement of the convention. In my view, one of the major challenges for the international community will be to find new solutions to encourage and enforce compliance by states unwilling to conform with the spirit of this or, indeed, other conventions.

         I also want to look very briefly at verification. The success of the convention will be determined by the effectiveness and the workability of its inspection and verification regime. The verification provisions are certainly not foolproof. The convention provides for two verification regimes: firstly, a routine monitoring regime involving annual declarations and systematic inspections and, secondly, a challenge inspection regime whereby any state can request an inspection of any facility in any other state. Both regimes are likely to be limited in their effectiveness and dependent, of course, upon state cooperation. The enormity of the problem the world community is now witnessing in North Korea, which is refusing to allow adequate International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities, despite the fact that it is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, is a very vivid illustration of the likely difficulties which lie ahead.

         The coalition has also expressed concern regarding the fact that under article 11 9(d) chemical riot control agents are not banned by the convention if used for `law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes'. There is clearly some potential ambiguity about the interpretation which may be given to this exception, particularly where domestic minority groups are involved. It is not hard to imagine situations where the distinction between `riot control' and `offensive action' could be very difficult to make. This ambiguity could open up a possible loophole in enforcing the terms of the convention. But I earnestly hope that the spirit of the convention can be interpreted to ensure the proper protection of minority groups vulnerable to human rights abuse. But clearly this could be fraught with danger.

         The coalition would urge that every effort be made bilaterally and multilaterally to overcome the shortcomings of the convention. Ratification of the convention and its entry into force will clearly not represent an end in itself. There is always that danger after long and protracted negotiations; one gets a warm inner glow and breathes a sigh of relief that one has been able to achieve the convention—and it is a significant achievement. Countries congratulate themselves on the success of their diplomatic efforts and seek to sell their achievement at home and trumpet it abroad. The dangers that still exist are overlooked in the celebratory atmosphere following the signing by so many countries of the convention. The ratification of the convention and its entry into force will not represent an end in itself.

         —The signature in January 1993 in Paris of the chemical weapons convention signalled a very important point in a process that, as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) indicated, can be traced to the 1925 Geneva protocol. As he firmly indicated, this country, with the support of the opposition throughout, has played a major role in the convention in later years.

         Probably the one thing that intensifies the interest on both sides of the House in this matter is the way in which these chemical weapons are often used against fairly isolated communities in countries that do not have major international media coverage of their internal affairs. I think the honourable member's comments on article 11 9(d) concerning the possible continued use of these chemicals for riot control within some countries give some indication of our long-term concerns with this matter. He alluded to the role of the Iraqi government in their use against the Kurds and also in the war with Iran.

         It is quite ironic that last year a BBC program revealed, probably for the first time internationally, the use by the British government of these weapons against the Kurds in what is now northern Iraq early this century. It has been subsequently shown that for quite a period the RAF dropped the precursors of some of the current weapons on Kurdish villages. Possibly there are some indications of that in parts of the hinterland of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

That was followed very soon after by the first affirmation by the international chemical industry, with its monetary interest in this field, to say, `Yes, something is wrong, we have to take a stand and we have to be socially responsible'. So the Australian effort was important, it has been perceived as such and it is a great credit to this country.

         There are very significant problems. Some of those relate to monitoring and verification. Equally, there is the problem of destruction. That has been of some interest to the Australian electorate and the Australian parliament because of the scrutiny of the possible impact on the Oceania region of the incineration and destruction of weapons on Johnson Atoll—717 kilometres from Hawaii. Commitments were made—I am not sure what the situation is today—when this matter was on the agenda in Australian politics that the United States, to ensure that pressure was taken off the Johnson Atoll and our region, would construct a significant number of destruction sites within the United States. There are very real problems about the way in which destruction will occur. In the United States there have been changes to the process of dealing with destruction. Quite frankly, the situation in Russia is even more alarming.

         Up to 1972, the United States resorted to ocean dumping and open pit incinerators. From 1972 to 1976, it reverted to chemical neutralisation, particularly in Colorado, but it was found that a number of ancillary technologies were needed. The one technology could not handle all chemicals, particularly mustard gas. In 1982 the United States started on a process of high temperature incineration. It has to deal with 29 different types of munitions in a three million item inventory. That has led to concerns from a number of environmental organisations and intense division with various states trying to restrict the movement of these items across the United States.

        I am not saying that that is the total truth, but it is indicative of the problem. That problem is even more serious in the former Soviet Union where, for the first time, a fairly autocratic governmental structure has had to deal with this novel problem of resident action, environmental groups and public scrutiny. The Chapayevsk institution was sited in an area where there were, within a 100 kilometre circle, 2.5 million people. This led to a 34-day protest. As I say, this was a very novel problem for the government authorities to deal with, to the point where they had to close the institution.

         As has been noted by previous speakers, this bill gives effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the chemical weapons convention and provides a legislative basis for its national implementation. This is quite a momentous bill. It is probably a reflection on this parliament that there are only six speakers listed for debate—three on either side of the House. The ramifications of the convention are global and extend not only over space but also over time. This is the first convention that bans a whole class of chemical weapons. It is a first in many respects. The convention takes on enormous details of verification. It has been compared in many ways to the convention on biological weapons but, as the honourable member for Reid has said, that did not have that wide expanse of verification. This bill is a landmark in the world history of weapons. It is sad that there are only three people on either side of the House here today to acknowledge this momentous event.

         Although chemical weapons cannot inflict the extent of damage of nuclear weapons, or even some more conventional weapons, they have always created fear and loathing amongst everyone generally, especially those who have ever been under attack. They have been called the poor man's atomic bomb. Part of the horror they engender is that they cannot be seen.

It is the first treaty ever to ban an entire class of weaponry and to provide adequate means for verifying such a ban. As I have already commented, it is the world's second true global disarmament treaty, the first being the 1972 biological weapons treaty. The definition of chemical weapon is extremely wide and includes herbicides, if they cause severe or long lasting effects, as a weapon of war. Tear gas is also banned as a method of warfare but not, as the honourable member for Kooyong noted, as a method of riot control.

         The first recorded attack by a chemical weapon occurred on 22 April 1915 in Ypres in Belgium by the German army. Mustard gas was one of the horrors of the First World War. As a child, I can still remember the stories that ex-servicemen told me about the First World War. Many of those stories concerned the fear they had of gas canisters coming towards them. I suspect that many people in this House have had similar experiences. Exposure to mustard vapour can cause eye and respiratory damage and skin burns. Other chemicals that have been used include Sarin, known as GB, and VX nerve agents.

         Since the First World War there have been other allegations about the use of chemical weapons. In 1951 the US was accused by China of using chemical weapons in the Korean War. In 1980 the Soviets alleged that the Vietnamese were using them in South-East Asia and Africa. More recently, there have been allegations that Iraq used chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war. It is equally concerning, but from a different aspect, that Iraq has also been accused of using chemical weapons against its own citizens, the Kurds. There would not be anybody in this House who did not feel absolute revulsion for a country that could use such a weapon against its own citizens.

         It is also interesting to note that in the 1980s the US Congress was still approving funding for the binary chemicals program. Binary chemicals require two chemicals to come together to make one lethal concoction. In 1982 President Reagan certified to Congress that binary chemical weapons were in the national interest of the United States. However, at that time, the US was already engaged in bilateral talks with the USSR on the cessation of the stockpiling of such weapons.

         The Geneva convention of 17 June 1925 represented the first major step taken towards stopping the use of chemical weapons, which I think has already been mentioned by the honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Kooyong. The Geneva convention prohibited the use but, as has been pointed out, not the stockpiling of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, as well as bacteriological methods of warfare.

         It was not until the 1970s that the USSR and the US agreed to hold bilateral talks in an effort to bring about the prohibition of chemical weapons. Multilateral talks between nations started in the 1980s. Since then the success of the negotiations has waxed and waned, with Australia taking an important role at one period when the impetus seemed to be lost.

         The role of Australia has been acknowledged by those involved with the convention. Senator Gareth Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, was a significant contributor to the process, which has been acknowledged by the honourable member for Kooyong. His role stands in contrast to the lack of interest shown by the government in putting this legislation through the House today. It is a pity that we have not seen more of this matter reported in the press because it is one of the major events to have happened in recent times.

         As the honourable member for Reid has stated, there are problems—not with the convention itself but with the enormous stockpiles of weapons. One of my interests is the environmental considerations, which have also been mentioned by the honourable member for Reid. Although it is taken as written that it is good to get rid of these weapons, the question arises of the environmental consequences of the two methods of disposal. One method is chemical neutralisation and the other is incineration.

         Chemical neutralisation involves mixing the chemicals with sodium hydroxide. One of the problems associated with this is that it increases the size of the waste something like four-fold to leave an extremely toxic sludge. If we take the amount of chemicals that are already stockpiled, multiply it by four and look at the chemical sludge that is left, we can see the environmental aspects and problems associated with what to do with the sludge.

         The alternative method is incineration. As the honourable member for Reid has said, this has raised concerns as to what happens to the gases that escape from the incineration. There is particular fear about dioxin entering the atmosphere. The US army has decided for various reasons that incineration should take place in situ, where the chemicals are already stored, partly because of the problems that would occur in transporting them. Not surprisingly, the people who live in the areas where incineration is likely to take place will not be all that thrilled to see those chemicals incinerated anywhere near where they live. It is another symbol of the NIMBY syndrome, but one that I suspect is highly justified. Were I in a country town or in any location where the army was about to incinerate weapons of chemical warfare, I too would probably raise my voice to protest concern for the health of my family and my children.

         The problem remains that these chemicals have to be destroyed. Because of the nature of the neutralisation process, incineration probably will be the preferred method. It will not be a cheap method. The estimated cost to the United States is $8 billion. The estimated cost for the destruction of these weapons in Russia is $10 billion. Because of the economic situation in Russia, it seems that the United States will have to provide assistance to help it get rid of those weapons. That is another financial consequence that the people of the United States are not very happy to wear, but one that I feel they will have to because, whatever else happens in this world, it is absolutely essential that we do get rid of all those weapons of chemical warfare.

         I hope that those countries which have not signed the convention or have indicated that they will not sign it will change their minds and that the verification process will be as extensive as it has been mooted to be in the convention. I hope that it does not become a case of all the good guys signing the convention, leaving those people who have not signed the convention with free rein to indulge in chemical weapons. Hopefully, the parts of those conventions that relate to the chemical industry will act in such a way as to make it almost impossible—hopefully totally impossible—for other countries to continue in the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons. I join with the honourable member for Kooyong in giving total support to this bill.

         —I was quite surprised when the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) came in this morning and puffed himself up and started an attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I said that he should be addressing the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill and he then had a go at me. He thought that my having the temerity to actually interject was not right. Maybe he was upset because I had beaten a couple of his mates, Mr Tom Warwick and Mr Frank Ford, in election campaigns of the past. I understand why the honourable member for Kooyong feels this way. I feel sorry for him and his party. Once again they have been frustrated; they lost the election. The Liberal Party is naturally tearing itself apart because of this lack of winning, because it has no policies, and because it backs losers all the time. I can appreciate his frustration, but I do feel a bit sorry for him. We only have to look at today's

For many years they have been working on this and we should all feel very proud of what they have done for our nation. Once again Australia and its officials, led by the Labor government, have achieved a result far beyond what even they believed they could do. The Australian Labor government has, on the world scene, had a huge influence on many decisions. A few decisions that we were involved include GATT, the saving of Antarctica, greenhouse gases, the changing scene in Cambodia, and of course the chemical weapons convention. All of these decisions would not have come about except for the influence that we—the Labor government—have had on the officials in the various departments, and the work that they have done over many years to bring all these things to fruition. I believe that Senator Evans summed up the issue of chemical weapons very well in his second reading speech. He said:

         I would like to look at the issue of chemical weapons and discuss the horrendous impacts of some of them. We have had a lot of discussion on the bill itself but no-one so far has mentioned just what chemical weapons do.

        Most people think of chemical warfare as more revolting than any other form of warfare, except perhaps nuclear war.

         Chemical warfare is about as old as warfare itself. In the fifth century BC, for example, sulfur fumes were used in Greece, and toxic smokes were described in early Indian and Chinese literature. Arsenic and other poisonous gases were used in the Middle Ages. But chemical warfare as we know it dates from the First World War. During that war, at least 45 chemical warfare agents were used by both sides. A total of 100 million kilograms of chemicals were used—mainly chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas. They killed 100,000 people and injured another million or so. Serious after-effects, including blindness, tuberculosis, lung cancer and bronchitis, afflicted the survivors, often for the rest of their lives. I can remember that, when I was a child during the Second World War, we had a shelter in our backyard in Hawthorn. I can still recall training to put on my gasmask, because we were expecting some sort of attack in Melbourne. Thankfully it was never used but I often wonder what would have happened if our opponents had used this cheap weapon on Australia.

         Chemical weapons were used by the Italians against the Ethiopians in 1935-36 and Japan used them against the Chinese between 1937 and 1945. During the Second World War, Hitler's Germany gassed millions of Jews in concentration camps. We also have the latest examples in Iraq and Iran. Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurdish civilians, most notably at Halabja in March 1988, when about 5,000 Kurds died and 7,000 were injured. Apart from these major uses of chemical weapons there have been many stories of relatively minor uses. In April 1989, for example, the Soviet police used chloracetophenone, or CN, against demonstrators in Georgia, causing some deaths and injuries.

         Various types of chemical weapons have been made and used, and I will inform the House of a few of those weapons and what they can do. A binary chemical weapon, which has already been mentioned, is one in which two chemicals are combined. On their own, neither is very poisonous but when they are mixed together they produce a nerve gas. Isopropanol and methylphosphonyl difluoride, for example, are chemical components of a US binary weapon used in 155-millimetre artillery shells. The nerve gas they produce is sarin.

         In a binary weapon, the two chemicals are kept separate until the munition is fired. When this happens, the chemicals are mixed together so when the munition hits a target an aerosol cloud of nerve gas is produced. The military wants the new binary weapons because they are said to be very easy to store and they are safer.

         There is considerable concern about the rate at which countries are acquiring chemical weapons. The fact that there was very little international criticism of Iraq—the main culprit—for using chemical weapons in the Gulf War has been noted by all countries. The lack of criticism was all the more serious because the use of chemical weapons is without doubt a blatant violation of international law. Both Iraq and Iran were parties to the 1925 Geneva protocol prohibiting the use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and bacteriological methods of warfare.

          Incapacitating agents are mainly used by the police and other forces for riot control. The main effect of these compounds is that they induce violent vomiting. The choking agents attack the respiratory tract and make the membranes swell and the lungs fill with fluid. The victim actually drowns. Survivors normally suffer chronic breathing problems. Blister agents produce large water blisters on exposed skin which heal slowly and may become infected. These agents may also damage the eyes, blood cells and the respiratory tract.

         Blood agents are absorbed into the body by breathing. They kill by entering the bloodstream and, by attacking an enzyme, prevent the synthesis molecules from being used by the body as an energy source. This causes vital organs to cease functioning.

They can be made very easily by any chemist or, so I have been told, anyone with a bit of chemical knowledge. The compounds for the ingredients are available.

         Nerve gas will attack the nervous system within minutes of exposure. Symptoms of increasingly severe damage to the nervous system will occur. These effects occur because nerve gases, like many organophosphorous compounds, inactivate an enzyme in the body called acetylcholinesterase, which is essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system.

         Nerve impulses are transmitted between the nerve fibres and various organs and muscles by the compound. Normally, when acetylcholine has done its job it is destroyed so that the nerve fibres can transmit further impulses. The nerve gases inhibit these molecules. Therefore, these gases still act on the nerves in one's body. They accumulate and block nerve function.

Death comes from suffocation caused by a paralysis of the respiratory muscles. A minute drop of nerve gas, inhaled or absorbed through the skin or eyes, is enough to kill.

Only a fraction of a litre of this nerve agent would be needed to give such an organisation enormous killing power.

In that debate, I mentioned some of the types of chemicals that the Iraqi dictator had in his stockpile.

Between the years 431BC and 404BC, during sieges of two Athenian cities, the Spartans threw burning mixtures of sulfur and pitch over the walls. That produced fires that asphyxiated the residents. This was obviously something of considerable terror.

         In the Middle Ages, Genghis Khan shot huge balls of burning pitch and sulfur into cities as part of his standard plan of attack or siege. In 1812, Thomas Cochrane, a British naval officer, proposed the burning of ships filled with sulfur to drive Napoleon's forces from fortifications around French ports.

         During the Crimean War, a British chemist suggested two new munitions. One was a hollow shell, filled with a solution of phosphorous, which would break open on impact, exposing the phosphorous to the air, causing fires and blinding smoke. The other one was a brittle shell, filled with a compound that would burn, that could be used against Russian ships during the battles that raged in the Crimean War. Fortunately for the conscience of the British military leadership, the war department in the United Kingdom turned down those ideas. During the American Civil War, both sides either proposed or used chemicals as weapons. In 1905, in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese were said to have pushed burning rags soaked with arsenic compound into Russian trenches. I think the honourable member for Dunkley mentioned that too.

         There are three points prior to World War I that are important to mention in relation to chemical weapons. The first one is that chemical and biological weapons played a sometimes decisive role even before the birth of Christ. Secondly, the use of chemicals—with the exception of sulfur, which had been mined for about 1,000 years—was limited technologically. But it was seen as immoral long before the large-scale use in World War I. I mentioned the example of the proposals during the Crimean War.

         On 22 April 1915 near Ypres in Belgium, a German general's staff in a test released chlorine gas along a six-kilometre front. It had devastating results: 15,000 casualties were reported in the press and a hole eight kilometres long was created in the allied lines. Within six months the allies had produced their own gases. Both sides adopted simple gas masks. In July 1917 the Germans introduced mustard gas, delivered in liquid form by artillery shells. It took several hours to develop the cloud that was, of course, the potential danger to the troops but the areas were contaminated and could not be occupied safely for at least a day after attack. In fact, potent concentrations of mustard gas have since been discovered in the area of Verdun up to the late 1970s—such was the potency of the gases used at that time.

It was used by Italy in the 1935-36 war against the Abyssinians under the dictator Mussolini. From 1937 to 1945 the Japanese used it in China.

They have been used in a number of wars, as has been mentioned by earlier speakers, against Australian soldiers—for example, in World War I. More recently, they have been used in the Iran-Iraq war and again by the Iraqi government in internal actions against its Kurdish population. They are cheap, easy to produce and lethal. They can and have been used in all levels of conflict. Unfortunately, in this day and age, the technology is for sale and there are unscrupulous individuals and groups throughout the world who will export their technology regardless of the cost.

         In turning to the effects of chemical weapons, I refer briefly to the official history of the Australian Army Medical Services in the war of 1914-18. A report dated 17 July 1917 by Major C.G. Douglas RAMC of the British Gas Directorate outlined his investigation of the first casualties from what was then called yperite, now referred to as mustard gas. The report reads:

The gas was only slightly irritant to the nose and throat, causing a certain amount of sneezing, but no discomfort or oppression in the chest. There was no immediate lachrymation or irritation of the eyes. The immediate effects were so slight as to be practically unnoticed by many men. A few men experienced nausea and vomited while the gas bombardment was actually in progress. There is no doubt that the immediate effects produced by the gas were quite trifling. The majority of the men appear to have gone to sleep after the gas bombardment was over. From two to five hours later they were awakened with pain in the eyes which rapidly became intolerable. The eyes and nose were running as if they had a violent cold in the head. Sneezing was very frequent, but there seems to have been no cough or discomfort in the chest as a rule. Tickling of the nose and burning and irritation of the throat were usually present. Nausea became marked and repeated vomiting occurred and persisted for some hours. The gas in question appears to have been some substance allied to mustard oil.

At this time, the preferred method of disposal is high temperature incineration. As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) mentioned earlier, there are concerns about the actual impact of that form of disposal on the environment. When we talk about the disposal of weapons of this nature, we have to be very careful to ensure that the cure is not worse than the initial symptoms.

But, in terms of the wider question of the impact that the treaty will have on the world we live in, there is some hope and some scope for it to detect and deter military significant developments in chemical weaponry. I think that outcome is achievable for a number of reasons. The number of known chemical weapons possessors is small. At this stage, the US, Russia and Iraq are the only declared holders of chemical weapons. That minimises some of the developments needed in this area. The list of potential possessors, those not declared but suspected, is also relatively small in terms of the world community. That also will assist in the verification and notification of hot spots.

         When we look at the International Atomic Energy Agency and the problems that have been experienced recently with North Korea, for example, in relation to inspections and the verification of the existence of nuclear facilities and the capacity to develop nuclear weapons, we see how difficult it is to carry out verification and have a proper inspection regime. Only time will tell whether this system will work in a totally effective manner. It is certainly a quantum leap from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

         Export controls are also part of the system to be implemented under the convention. By `export controls' I mean that the movement and provision of certain types of chemicals that are crucial to the development of chemical weapons will over time be controlled. That will lead to restraint of the spread of those chemicals. It will also be an incentive to those parties who have not acceded to the treaty to actually become part of the treaty because over time, if they are not party to the treaty, they will have trouble getting hold of these chemicals, many of which have alternative uses which are safe and peaceful. Over time, I think that will assist in developing a system that enables us to know what is going on with these chemicals and what their movements are.

         Another key issue is what we can do to ensure that, if chemical weapons are utilised, people are in a position to try to defend themselves. The treaty protects the right of any party state to research, develop and produce means of defence against chemical weapons and encourages the fullest possible international cooperation in this field. Because of the difficulties already mentioned regarding the capacity to totally eliminate chemical weapons, the need to continue to develop defensive capabilities for those countries that may be subject to an attack of this nature is clear.

         The need to share defensive technologies amongst those nations that will be party to this convention is also of critical importance. Any initiatives that will assist countries to defend themselves against chemical warfare will assist in making chemical weapons less effective and therefore less desirable as a military option. This convention, as has been mentioned earlier, is not perfect—it has a range of problems—but it is a major step forward in the field of international disarmament and arms control.

         Australia can be proud of the role it has played in the development and conclusion of this treaty. However, much work remains to be done. Many nations who have signed are still to ratify. Some countries have not signed, including a number which are suspected internationally of holding or working to develop chemical weapons. The verification system remains to be tested. Although extensive in comparison to earlier treaties, the treaty faces difficulties regarding the cost of the verification system and the large number of potential sites involved.

         Disposal of existing stockpiles also presents a major challenge to the international community. Environmental concerns must be addressed and all potential disposal technologies must be investigated. However, this treaty has a lot going for it in comparison to its predecessors. The challenge is for the international community not to rest on its laurels. For this convention to succeed it will require a renewed commitment internationally to encourage ratification, pressure on non-signatories to take part. We must ensure that the verification system works and continue to build on the overwhelming view internationally that weapons such as these are abhorrent. Australia must continue its constructive role in ensuring that the above objectives are met. Our role in the development and conclusion of this convention should be a source of great pride to all of us, but we must continue to lead the way in the operation of the chemical weapons convention in the years ahead. I am confident that we can do that. I commend the bill to the House.

I draw the minister's attention to Ford's announcement today that it will close its Homebush factory and end production of the Capri. I also draw the minister's attention to Mitsubishi's statement last Friday which expressed its concern about the slow pace of delivery of necessary micro-economic and labour market reforms. How does the minister reconcile his supposed commitment to Australian manufacturing with his government's lack of action on the crucial issues of micro-economic reform, labour market flexibility and lower business input costs? Will the minister give his commitment that the forthcoming industry statement will contain measures to address these issues so that more Australian manufacturers are not forced to close and more jobs are not forced offshore?

The Homebush closure, in particular, will cause dislocation and some hardship, especially for the employees, with about 400 jobs being lost. I would have hoped that the shadow minister, as well as other members of the opposition, would join the government in saying that we are pleased to see that Ford is committed to assisting those employees to find new positions and trying, where possible, to encourage people to undertake retraining programs.

         Today's announcement, of course, is of some concern, but it has to be put into perspective. The car industry today is undergoing change, but the car industry has also had some success. It is focusing on the segments of the car industry where it has the greatest chances of success, especially with the medium and large cars. It is also able to do that in a market which allows it to trade internationally. In 1985 our motor vehicle industry's exports were only about $380 million—that is, $380 million of exports when the honourable member opposite was advising the Fraser government. Today, exports from the motor vehicle industry total $1.5 billion. That is a massive turnaround.

         With that record, I would have thought that people opposite would have not only highlighted the difficulties that arise in the car industry, such as those at Homebush, but also given the government and the industry credit when it has been able to encourage investment in the long-term future of this industry—an industry which those opposite would have wiped out with their zero tariff policies if they had been on this side of the House. If the Leader of the Opposition had been sitting in this chair here, the Australian car industry would have been shutting up its entire operation in Australia because those opposite wanted zero tariffs. We all know that they have suddenly seen the light and do not favour zero tariffs any more, even though the honourable member for Barker has criticised your tariff policies in the party room.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question because it raises a very important issue for economic recovery, and that is business investment, which to this stage has not been a substantial factor at all in recovery. Although we have been out of recession for some time now with growth for the last nine quarters, we have not had any assistance in that period from business investment. But that is to be expected, because business investment will not take place early in the recovery, because capacity utilisation is low and there is basically no incentive for businesses to invest more in increasing capacity when they are not using their existing capacity at anything like full bore.

         As the recovery goes on, clearly the circumstances in which capacity utilisation is a pressure on the operations of the company and an inducement to increased investment come more into play. We are now starting to reach that stage. It is also important in trying to develop that business investment that conditions exist in the economy which are conducive to increased investment, apart from simply pressure on existing capacity, if we are not going to get spill over into increased imports.

         The important factor for us to realise at the moment is that conditions do exist in Australia for business investment which are very conducive to investment taking place. The government has been concerned over the last couple of years to provide various incentives for business to undertake investment. Since the One Nation package of early 1992, we have brought down a number of measures to assist investment: accelerated depreciation, which this year will cost in the order of $215 million; the reduction of company tax to 33 per cent, which this year will cost about $440 million; the 10 per cent general investment allowance, which this year will cost about $130 million; and the development allowance, which is a special investment allowance for large projects over $50 million.

         That is something which will come into play more gradually, but something like 165 applications for registration have been granted at this stage, with a total capital value of $37 billion. There were, in fact, 500 applications for registration with a total capital value of over $100 billion. Of those 500, so far 165 have progressed to being registered and their total capital value is $37 billion. One hundred of those have been approved in the last half year.

         I think it is also important to mention in this context, particularly in light of today's news and the first question, that the development allowance has now been extended to the motor industry. That resulted from change to the legislation last year which received royal assent a few weeks ago. Those who have major projects in the motor vehicle industry and the print media, which was also part of that amendment, have until next Tuesday to get their applications for registration to the Development Allowance Authority.

         There are also fundamental improvements to the economy which are conducive to investment. We see corporate profitability at a high level. In fact, it is getting close to the peak level of 1989 even though, of course, we are at a much lower stage of the cycle than we were then. Interest rates are at historical lows; they are the lowest in 20 years. Inflation is around its lowest level for 30 years and, importantly, inflationary expectations are very low. The recent National Australia Bank survey of business inflation expectations showed that 80 per cent of businesses expected inflation to be less than four per cent for the rest of the century. So, clearly, business expectations of inflation are very good. We have also had dramatic improvements in our international competitiveness over the last few years. As I mentioned, the fact that spare capacity is starting to be eroded is also a real factor in inducing investment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         All of this means that we can be confident of business investment becoming a much stronger factor from here on. The recent September quarter survey by the Bureau of Statistics on capital expenditure points to a pick-up in plant and equipment expenditure in the remainder of this year. The National Australia Bank has revised up its business investment expectations for this year and three quarters of respondents to the recent BCA survey expect to increase investment in the six months to March 1994, with one-third expecting it to increase by 10 per cent.

         As a result of all of that, we have been able to upgrade our investment forecasts for this year. We originally budgeted for investment to increase by only a quarter of a per cent. As a result of the changes to the forecasts, which I announced last week, that figure became 4 1/4 per cent. That is for the whole year on the whole year. More indicative of what is happening is the through the year figure. The through the year figure in the budget was 10 3/4per cent. We now expect that to be more like 16 3/4 per cent. We can be confident that business investment will pick up. It is already picking up and the conditions are there for much larger impact in business investment in the next financial year.

The Senate was designed to operate as a states house.

         —The issue of superannuation is a very important one to everyone in the community, increasingly so as everyone is affected by it as a result of this government's policies. It would be a matter of great concern to people to learn that the opposition is intending to interfere with their prospects of substantial superannuation payments on retirement. If the opposition were to come into office, there would be a freezing of the super guarantee at its then levels, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated on Sunday to be his policy, which the Prime Minister referred to yesterday.

         The honourable member for Corio asked what the effect would be on a worker. Let us look at a worker earning $600 a week who started to be covered by the super guarantee in 1992 at age 25, and who expects to work until age 65. Leaving aside the employee contribution and taking it to the nine per cent, and making some conservative assumptions about a CPI growth of two per cent, wages growth of 3 1/2 per cent and super fund investment earnings of six per cent, that worker could look forward to a superannuation benefit at retirement of $464,000.

         If the opposition were to get into office at the next election and if the Leader of the Opposition were the leader and he implemented his policy of freezing the super guarantee, that amount of money would be reduced by $120,000.

         This is a major policy item that the opposition is expounding through its leader. By freezing the super guarantee charge, it is going to take direct action to ensure that workers of this country would receive far less in the way of retirement benefits through the super guarantee charge than would happen under this government's policy. That is bad enough, but in yesterday's question when the Prime Minister was emphasising this point, the Leader of the Opposition kept interjecting, `What about the FitzGerald report?', as though Dr FitzGerald in his report on national savings had said that there was something wrong with the super guarantee charge.

         It is true that Dr FitzGerald had some criticisms of it, but he did not say that it should be frozen. He said that it was not big enough. He said that it should be 18 per cent not 12 per cent. The criticism that he made was not anything like what the Leader of the Opposition was talking about. He in no way endorses the policy of the Leader of the Opposition of freezing the super guarantee charge. Dr FitzGerald said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The super guarantee is not much ado about nothing. Fully implemented . . . it would . . . raise national saving by a very substantial 2-2 1/2 per cent of GDP.

        Obviously he sees it as a major factor in improving national savings and therefore as a very important part of government policy. He also said:

        I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition was getting at yesterday in talking about the FitzGerald report, because it does not support him one iota. It might reflect the fact that not only is the Leader of the Opposition confused about superannuation policy but so too is the whole opposition. Dr FitzGerald disagrees with the Leader of the Opposition, as does the honourable member for Mayo. The honourable member for Mayo makes various comments in an article in today's

         There is much talk about a policy vacuum in the opposition—but it is more than a policy vacuum; it is a policy mayhem. Those opposite are running around producing their own policies. Bronwyn Bishop is running around talking about the need to knock off the capital gains tax, and the honourable member for Bennelong is running around with his income splitting policy. They are making up their own tax policies as they go along. This is what we expect from an opposition which is leaderless, which does not know where it is going and which is in a state of total chaos—and long may it continue.

Something which is often forgotten, but let us not forget it, is that in Australia we have extremely good expertise in the area of environmental management—sanitation, waste management and clean water supplies. By showcasing Australia's expertise and technology, development cooperation provides opportunities for Australian firms to get involved in South-East Asia and to meet an enormous growing infrastructural demand. Indeed, the World Bank has estimated that by 1995, next year, the total demand for environmental activities in south and South-East Asia will be around $US35 billion and currently much of that is unmet.

By the way, on the honourable member for Barker's declaration of interests, under the heading `real estate', where the rest of us have our interests articulated, he says, `No'. The honourable member for Barker has actually breached the requirements of the House of Representatives by not articulating on his statement his property interests. What is he saying—that these companies do not own properties? If they do own properties, he is required by the guidelines—which he knows he is in breach of—to enter the properties.

As honourable members know, over the last two years the housing industry has performed, in terms of the number of starts, as well as at any time in the postwar period. Furthermore, affordability levels are as good as they have been for nine years and we operate in an inflationary environment which is better than it has been for 30 years.

         The housing industry continues to perform well, although the expectation is that there will be some downturn next year. That is all the more reason why we should be looking at the structure of the housing industry for the future. It is a matter of great concern. As was pointed out by the managing director of A.V. Jennings last week, some 45,000 small firms are currently operating in the housing industry in Australia. The managing director makes the point that that degree of fragmentation makes the prospects for the housing industry in international competition very difficult.

         That is why it is important to emphasise the importance of the development of offsite manufacture in relation to housing. Indeed, a quiet revolution is under way in housing design and construction. There is a shift towards greater use of offsite manufacturing for many components of the Australian housing industry. This shift makes housing more affordable. It is a positive response by the residential development industry to the government's agenda of increasing housing choice. The residential development industry—including planners, architects, land developers, builders, building material manufacturers and suppliers—is changing the way in which it constructs and provides its products. This is a very important shift.

         It is interesting that the comment made by A.V. Jennings reflects the fact that it, the largest volume builder in Australia, is now constructing something like 50 per cent of the new houses in Queensland and northern New South Wales with this manufactured approach in which the great majority of the housing components and the construction of the housing is done offsite. That results in considerable efficiencies but, more importantly, it lays the basis for the development of a strong housing export industry.

         It is not simply a matter of offering more choice within the Australian housing industry. The housing industry needs to position itself so that it will be able to export its product and to play a role in relation to Australia's place within the region. Frankly, that will not happen while the industry continues to be so highly fragmented. It will not happen unless approaches are adopted that not only produce greater efficiency and reduce regulations but also make the construction of housing more efficient and more competitive.

         One can see from the way houses are constructed effectively in a day and fully completed within a week that these kinds of approaches are extremely important for efficiency and choice in Australia and, in the long term, for building an export base. The remarks I have made are very important. They are salutary. I believe the industry ought to be looking at what is occurring and seeking to restructure so that it can make a much greater contribution to Australia's export performance.

         It is no secret that 40 per cent of all federal government award employees are now involved in enterprise bargaining. It is no secret that the enterprise bargaining process is producing, and continues to produce, enormous results. In the area where it has not been extended—the private sector—this government acted decisively last year to provide the opportunity for enterprise agreements to be spread throughout the whole of the federal award structure. As at the end of March, legislation will be in place which will allow for enterprise bargaining to be spread across the length and breadth of the Australian work force. It is against that background that the Managing Director of BHP remarked only last week that industrial relations was no impediment to Australian industry being world competitive. That is not my view; that is the view of the leader of our biggest company.

But let us also be balanced by acknowledging the fact that there has been a steady decline in the performance of the particular models produced at that plant. That is against the background of a 12.5 per cent increase in Ford's overall performance. Of course, if we are to be world competitive we have to take into account the fact that some areas of production will go down and others will go up. It is enterprise bargaining that will underpin our future. It is enterprise bargaining that this government is not only committed to but also spreading through the whole of the Australian work force.

         —I think many members of this House and many observers of the proceedings of parliament might have thought until today that they had heard the last word or seen the last act by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when it came to his contempt for the great institution of the Australian parliament. But we were mistaken because, in question time today, we saw in microcosm precisely what is wrong with the Prime Minister's attitude towards this parliament and why the Australian public holds the proceedings of parliament—particularly of question time—in such low repute, as they undoubtedly do.

         The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) asked the Prime Minister a very precise question. He did not allege in his question that the Prime Minister had necessarily done anything wrong; he did not ask him a question that was outside the bounds of the standing orders; he asked the Prime Minister a very simple question: if an independent inquiry says his piggery is environmentally unsound, will he relocate his piggery? That is what he asked the Prime Minister. What did we get? We got no answer and we got 10 minutes of irrelevant abuse from the Prime Minister of this country about the opposition collectively. It was personal abuse and it was against my colleague and friend the honourable member for Barker, in particular.

Unless that is fixed—that means fixing the Prime Minister, getting rid of the Prime Minister—we will never lift the esteem of this parliament in the eyes of the Australian community.

         He must be the most imperial republican Australia has ever seen, because if ever there were a person who had a pretence towards a system of absolutism it would be the current Prime Minister of Australia. I have finally come to the conclusion that the reason he wants to get rid of the Queen is that she is a constitutional monarch. I am quite certain that if she were an absolute monarch he would not only want to get rid of her but also want to replace her. Basically, this man has no reverence and no respect for the basic institutions of this country. If we go through his long career in public life, we will find contempt piled upon contempt for the great institutions of Australia.

In other words, he is somebody who, in imperial fashion, deigns occasionally to bless us with his presence. Now he is translating that into action with these changes to question time. He regards the Senate as being unrepresentative swill.

         Not only does this man have contempt for this chamber but also he regards the Senate as being unrepresentative swill. He has no regard at all for the constitution of Australia, which has served this country well for almost 100 years. If honourable members thought that his contempt was reserved for institutions that might occasionally be associated in the eyes of some in the community with our side of politics, let me remind honourable members that two to three years ago the Prime Minister led an attack on one of those institutions which has been at the heart of the Australian labour movement for almost 100 years, and that is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

I notice that the honourable member for Banks is nodding. Undoubtedly he, along with his mate the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), will agree with everything I am about to say. In April 1991, when the Industrial Relations Commission handed down a decision that was unacceptable politically to the government, instead of accepting the umpire's decision, the Prime Minister said that the Industrial Relations Commission was corrupting the system. Instead of accepting that institution, which has been there for almost 100 years and which is sanctified by an act of parliament, the Prime Minister said, `Because it has given a decision that I don't like, I'm going to denigrate it, I'm going to push it aside and I'm going to traduce the integrity of the members of the commission'.

The reason these changes are being made is that the Prime Minister's minders have told him that it suits his convenience. The fact that he is reducing the accountability of the executive to parliament, that under these changes the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) would have been able to avoid the scrutiny to which she has been subjected over the last three weeks, is of no account to the Prime Minister. His sole objective has been to reduce the power and the role of parliament and to increase his own power, prestige and authority in this country.

         For 93 years it has been the parliamentary tradition in Australia to have a robust question time. The Prime Minister defended question time when it suited him. He said that this was the clearing house of the nation's ideas. Now when it suits him to say and do otherwise, he dismisses question time as being of little account. In other words, parliamentary respect and tradition is turned on and off like a tap according to the Prime Minister's own political convenience. It suited the Prime Minister to use question time as a forum to abuse the opposition and to lie and cheat about the effect of its policies in the lead-up to the last election.

He has been prepared to overturn this tradition. He and his colleague the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) rely rather speciously on some British precedents.

         The Prime Minister says, `In Britain the Prime Minister does not turn up every day'. Everybody knows that the House of Commons sits for 140 to 150 days a year. In contrast, the House of Representatives sits for 60 to 70 days a year. If we halve—as the Prime Minister intends to do in two weeks time—the number of days the Prime Minister has to come in here and answer questions, the Australian Prime Minister will answer questions on half the number of days that the British Prime Minister answers questions.

Despite the intrinsic merit, it fell foul of the Keating jackboot. It did so because it did not suit his idea of how to run parliament to suit his own personal convenience. He would have said, `I don't want those opposition points of order rebroadcast on the television news bulletins. That means my abuse might be equalled by their reply. You can't have that. That's fair; that's balanced. You can't have fairness and balance in reporting of question time. Question time is a courtesy that the executive affords to the parliament.

I said, `Kim, this number of 14 questions minimum. Are you going to write that into the sessional orders?'. He said, `That's a bit hard to do, John'. In other words, the government is not going to guarantee it. I will tell the House what is going to happen to the minimum of 14 questions. If the way question time is going does not suit the Prime Minister, whether we have had only three questions, if it suits his convenience he will pick up his papers and scuttle out of the House the way he did a few months ago when the opposition leader was having a go at him.

         The fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Bennelong had much to be ashamed about in 1975. We on this side of the House do not accept lectures on the principles of the constitution. It will be some considerable period of time, I feel, before any of us will feel inclined to accept lectures on matters of principle from those opposite. However, we note with interest the utter obsession that has developed on the other side of the House with the personality and person of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister has already been before the electorate five times to have his conduct and attitude judged by the constituency to which the honourable member appeals. Five times he has appeared—the first four of those as a very prominent member and substantial contributor to the election campaigns of the government under Mr Hawke and on the latest occasion as Prime Minister.

         There have been repeated opportunities for the general public to make judgments about whether or not they feel they can live with his attitudes on things such as the monarchy or the Australian flag. None of these views were concealed from the Australian public during the last election campaign and the Australian public has the commonsense to know that it does not matter what the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong, I or anyone else thinks about the structure of the Australian constitution because before there is any change to the Australian constitution the public has to be consulted. That is all there is to it. It is as simple as that.

         The opposition, however, does not actually debate the principle of whether or not a constitutional monarchy is the sort of government that best suits us now, whether or not a non-Australian head of state representing, as a head of state frequently does, Australian interests overseas is the best way to go about things or whether or not we ought to codify the reserve powers—all of these sorts of issues flung up by the question of whether or not we should move to a republic. The explanation opposition members give to the Australian public as to why we should not change a constitution that has been in place for 100 years and which is supposed to last for thousands more is that they might impose an imperial presidency from Mr Keating. The interesting feature of that is that that is their obsession.

         I grew up in politics when Labor had a long period in opposition. We had an obsession, too. Our obsession was Bob Menzies. We found ourselves extraordinarily hard-pressed to stand up and sensibly develop and portray our policy because, I am afraid to say, in those days we were obsessed with the personality of Bob Menzies. So rather than debate the issues of the day we used to chant `Pig-iron Bob, pig-iron Bob'. We deserved to be where when we allowed ourselves to descend to such a moronic state of affairs. Those opposite have descended to that moronic state of affairs and that is why they are having the judgment passed on them which has been passed by the electorate on the last five occasions.

         The opposition makes great play of the fact that, from time to time, the Prime Minister uses colourful language. Colourful language used in this place tends to have attention drawn to it by the Speaker and from time to time the Prime Minister, as have opposition members, has been obliged to make withdrawals of statements he has made or expressions he has used. The thing I am interested about in all of this, again, is the psychology of those in the opposition and the utter obsession that they have developed with the personality of the Prime Minister and the fear in which they regard him.

         I cite one example. The Prime Minister did on one occasion use the term `scumbag' in this place—a term he must have seen when he viewed a Martin Scorsese film that used that epithet to describe a particular conflict between various elements of the criminal classes. He used that expression once in parliament in 1984. Yet, for the last nine years these absurd people opposite have been devoted to the portrayal in public that `this fellow goes around calling us scumbags'. It is an interesting reflection on the psychological condition of the opposition, not on the personality of the Prime Minister. Therefore, it has some level of historic interest from that point of view, but no interest whatsoever in terms of the governing of this nation.

         The opposition in this regard, because of its obsession with the personality of the Prime Minister in a republican debate, has drawn appropriate rebukes from decent conservative commentators like Gerard Henderson. I recollect an article a while ago. I think it was written by Gerard Henderson. He referred to either the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Bennelong and said, `So for you the debate has descended to this—you can't vote for a republic of Australia because the current Prime Minister might become president'. That demonstrates the pathetic decline in the mental capacities of those opposite in handling this problem. They are manifesting that sort of psychological condition, the deeply embattled experience.

         When I was Minister for Defence, from time to time I had described to me that soldiers often found themselves in an embattled condition. They become extremely narrowly focused as the threat to them develops. It is what makes them effective, at least in the context of a fighting war; that is, the very narrow conception of who is the enemy, to the exclusion of all other materials from the psychological environment around them. Unfortunately, they are not the sorts of circumstances which lead to commonsense in debate in normal political democratic arrangements. Those opposite manifest that psychological condition, as they are deeply wounded by the Prime Minister.

          Those opposite have also raised the issue of question time. They come in here and say, `We are not going to be able to subject you to the scrutiny that we would be able to if you did not have rotational question time. But if you had given us supplementary questions and the opportunity to ask about 16 questions, then we would have been a bit more cheerful about it'. There has been one question per week from the Leader of the Opposition since this parliament sat. Eighteen per cent of all questions directed by the opposition since this parliament met have gone to the Prime Minister. If those opposite cannot fit their leader's question and the 18 per cent of their total questions into the increased number they will have available to them, that is too bad. What an extraordinary commentary on those opposite that their leader cannot get his one question up to the Prime Minister in the space of two blocks of 28 questions. If he cannot ask one question in the two blocks of 28 questions, it is too bad. It is a judgment on them, not a judgment on the Prime Minister.

The British parliament also sits in a different whipping system from the one we have. The British parliament rarely has assembled the entirety of the body of members of parliament in the British House of Commons.

         The second point is that, when ministers come for scrutiny to the British parliament, they do not come on rotation twice a week. British ministers come for scrutiny in the British parliament about once every three or four weeks. They do not come in blocks of 10, they come in blocks of one with junior ministers attached to them and turn up once every three weeks.

When they ask that question, which is usually a bland, general question, they get up and ask a supplementary, which is the real question. So they have one question and that is that. That proposition of the opposition is a load of nonsense.

Everybody in the gallery and everybody out there knows that the Prime Minister doing what he is doing is probably acting to his political disadvantage—it may well be to his political advantage. As the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, from time to time he has very successfully demonised foolish opposition policy.

The Leader of the Opposition says that all this emanates from the oval office. A vast array of reforms are being put in here. Virtually, all of them that are in the Blewett report are being implemented. As far as I am concerned, I have heard the term `oval office' applied to the last three Prime Ministers. I have not been around to hear that term applied to any of their predecessors, but I suspect it was used then too. It is a very common term used around the place and it proves absolutely nothing about what the Leader of the Opposition had to say.

On a number of occasions if she has not misled the House, she could have fooled me. She certainly has gone to a point where everybody out there, including the major media around Australia, says she should have resigned.

Sure, the Prime Minister calls the Senate unrepresentative swill, but do not forget that the product of these changes is to enhance the power of the other place. All the Prime Minister is doing is giving that place a greater opportunity to sit in committee, a greater opportunity to consider legislation and an opportunity to debate the nuances of legislation, as I am sure my friend the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) will endorse. The Prime Minister has ensured that the unrepresentative swill will more and more assume the responsibility that people expect of this place.

We have a minister under some form of scrutiny—the minister for the environment, sports rorts and whatever. As my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out, when it was suggested by the committee that there should be some capacity to amend the roster in order that a minister or the Prime Minister under persistent scrutiny on a sensitive policy issue might be called to the House, the response was, `Oh, no, that cannot be done'.

The tragedy is that, under the present Prime Minister, it has been developed into an art form. These changes to our standing orders are going to reduce the availability of ministers of this chamber, lessen their accountability to the public and ensure that where one minister or another has abused the processes of their position they will not be able to be examined in the way that they should. Honourable members might say, `But does that happen?'. I have already given two instances.

If honourable members look at the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, they will see that it made a big thing of this. Supposedly, questions were put only to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Why is that the case? It is because 90 per cent of questions put to government ministers are dorothy dixers. Every question asked by government members is not a question wanting some sort of an explanation of policy.

The honourable member for Bennelong said, `It's awful.

         The proposal is that we do give the opposition a fair go. Members on this side—and I think some of those opposite—are starting to believe that the opposition members are terrible masochists because they come in here each day and feed a line to the Prime Minister, who then gives them a little reminder of what it was like when they were all going to boarding school. I suppose some of them went to boarding schools where they were beaten every day—and liked being beaten every day—so each day the Prime Minister reminds them of that. The honourable member for Bennelong said, `It's terrible that he does that, but it is also terrible that he is not going to be here every day to do it'.

When the then Leader of the Opposition would ask the then Prime Minister a question, the right honourable member for New England would have poor old silly Tom McVeigh answer it because Malcolm did not want to answer questions.

         So, if opposition members want to talk about how terrible it is that the Prime Minister comes in here and answers their questions, they ought to remember that they had a Prime Minister who was not even willing to answer questions from honourable members in this House. He used to sit there arrogantly with his back to the Speaker of the day, Billy Snedden, whom he hated and would not even look in the eye; he would look the other way and not even bother answering the questions. Who was putting him up to that? The right honourable member for New England, who wants to forget all about these things and talk about the good old days. The good old days that he wants to talk about are some reminiscences with the nasty little things that he did blotted out. He can get away with this with a lot of people, but the trouble is that a lot of these things are in the records. He should look at them before he starts writing these rosy little glowing stories about what it was like when he was a decent person. It is pretty hard for many of us to remember when he ever was, and he will not go out of this place with our thinking that he is.

         The person who was behind him, doing this as well, was the honourable member for Bennelong. We never heard the honourable member for Bennelong say, `Malcolm, you'd better get up and answer those questions. This is terrible, Malcolm; you're sitting there with your back to Billy'. The honourable member for Bennelong sat in the front row and said, `This is terrific. Just bat those Labor blokes off real quick'. But it is awful when it happens to him, and that is what makes him so bitter and so unhappy. The trouble with both the honourable member for Bennelong and the right honourable member for New England is that they have the most flexible arguments that anyone could ever be asked to put up with. I wonder sometimes whether they even believe them themselves.

         The right honourable member for New England told us how terrible it was about the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She is under attack and those opposite want her to go to a committee. She will not go—how shocking and terrible! It is pretty shocking and terrible when people will not go to a committee. Of course, when the right honourable member for New England was under attack, he would not go to a committee meeting; he would not go near the Senate committee that was looking into the Asia dairy scandal—not in a fit was he going to go near there!

These proposals will enable this chamber to go back to the way it probably should have worked in the rosy old days that the right honourable member for New England cannot remember. For the last 10 years or so, question time in this chamber has not been a place where people come in, ask considered questions and get reasonable answers. The questions are not considered and the answers are too long. There is no doubt about that. The questions are all out of order. We hear statements—there are no questions involved in them. The ones that opposition members ask are not questions; they are statements of fact.

         The new proposal will start to get question time back to the way it should be. If question time is about accountability, maybe some of the backbenchers should be able to have a go. In 1992, 70 per cent of the questions asked by the opposition were asked by three opposition office holders—the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party. Most of the opposition backbenchers never got to ask a question. In fact, I think one of the opposition frontbenchers never bothered asking a question.

         Whom were this opposition asking the questions of? Seventy per cent of the questions were to the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance or the Prime Minister. What about the rest of the ministers? They would come in here every day—day in, day out—and not receive a question. In fact, in 1992 the Minister representing the Minister for Defence was asked no questions, and last year he was asked one question. In 1992 the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was asked no questions, and last year he was asked one question. This shows how much the opposition cares about scrutinising ministers. Most of the junior ministers never received any questions. The rostering proposal will ensure that they do.

         Having a minimum of 14 questions will ensure that more questions are asked, and an extra day of question time will ensure that the opposition has more opportunities. If the truth were known, we would probably find that the reason opposition members think this is a bad idea is that they are so damned bone lazy and it will mean another day when they have to think up more puerile questions. The problem for them is that it will be another day when they will have to read the morning newspapers to try to think up what to ask at question time.

This system can work and it can work well. I believe it will be better than the current system.

        This bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate in that act two excise tariff proposals that have been previously tabled in the parliament. Excise tariff proposal No. 2 1993 proposed a reduction in the excise duty payable in respect of gasoline for use in aircraft, or avgas, and excise tariff proposal No. 3 1993 proposed an increase in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas and kerosene for use in aircraft, or avtur.

         Clause 3 of the bill proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas from $0.25456 per litre to $0.22443 per litre, a reduction of 3.013c per litre. This reduction is effective from 1 July 1993. This decrease results from three sources. The first is from the final stage of the government's program of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging owners of local ownership plan aerodromes to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is the result of changes in cost-recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the Civil Aviation Authority. The third is the result of changes in cost recovery arrangements by the CAA in respect of the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. Both the firefighting and meteorological services will now be directly charged to aircraft operators.

         The cost savings from these sources result in a corresponding reduction in the proportion of excise duty used to fund the aerodromes and the firefighting and meteorological services. This reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of a decrease in the rate of excise duty payable on avgas. A decrease of 1.013c per litre is attributable to the aerodrome transfer program and the remaining 2c per litre reduction is attributable to the CAA in respect of firefighting and meteorological services.

         Clause 4 of the bill proposes an increase in the excise duty payable on avgas to $0.22999 per litre, an increase of 0.264c per litre. This increase was announced in the 1993 federal budget and is effective from 1 September 1993. The purpose of the increase is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is the first stage in a program to phase in recovery of the industry's contribution to these costs.

       Excise tariff proposal No. 1 1994 contains alterations to correct commencement dates of the Excise Tariff Act (No. 2) 1993. The proposal operates from 24 December 1993. Legislation was introduced in the 1993 budget sittings to institute provisions relating to the substitution of petroleum products and the production of beer in non-commercial premises. The legislation was included in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993.

        Also included in the package of amendments were changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme which were extensively amended by parliament. This necessitated the bill being renumbered prior to royal assent. A number of sections contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993 referred to provisions in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1993 for their commencement. The Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993, however, was not renumbered to reflect the renumbering of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1993 resulting in incorrect cross-references for the commencement provisions of the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993. The amendments proposed in this excise tariff proposal correct this error. I commend the proposal to the House.

        Unless the parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries to ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act 1952, which sets this sum, are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. The sum appropriated is to meet the expected cost of salaries and no more. While the act covers the total cost of salaries, it does not set the amount of individual salaries to ministers.

         The enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 has had, amongst other things, the effect of linking the basic salary levels for parliamentarians to the top of the Senior Executive Service band one level in the Australian Public Service. There is also a similarly proportioned increase in the salaries of ministers of state. Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act, the government set in train arrangements to ensure that the relativities established between the salaries of parliamentarians at that time are maintained. That is, ministers' salaries are increased at the same rate and at the same time as salaries of senators and members of the parliament increase.

         The IPU is an international organisation which brings together representatives of the parliaments of sovereign states. It is the focal point for worldwide parliamentary dialogue on political, economic, social and cultural problems of international significance. One of the most important subjects which came before us at this conference was the situation in Yugoslavia. A motion to that effect was moved by the IPU. I served on the political committee which made a determination and was involved in the drafting committee.

Following the referral to the committee on political questions, international security and disarmament, I made the point that Australia is home to hundreds of thousands of people from Yugoslavia who represent all sections of the community. I noted that the Balkans have traditionally played a very important role in the determination of European history and that the present situation could be a major destabilising factor unless some solutions are found both internally and by the world community.

         Sadly, the simple fact of the matter is that, since the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, what is now taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is a small microcosm of the wider problems in what was formerly Yugoslavia. They present Europe with undoubtedly the most important threat to international security since the end of the Cold War. There are dangerous parallels between the Balkans and the Spanish Civil War. We should never lose sight of the fact that the Spanish Civil War was, in many respects, the introductory chapter to World War II.

         The Spanish Civil War saw the rise of fascism. It saw both the fascist states of Italy and Germany taking the side of Franco. The socialist states, led by the USSR, took the side of the government in Madrid. There is a very real risk that a similar situation could well develop in Yugoslavia, especially in the context of the close relationship between Russia and Serbia. It is in this context, therefore, that the world watches with growing horror the events which take place there almost daily.

The so-called bread queue massacre helped convince the United Nations to impose sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia. In June 1993, 15 people were killed and more than 100 were injured when shells slammed into a crowd watching a soccer game near Sarajevo airport.

         It is in that context that I made the observation at the conference that this civil war has been fought along ethnic lines. Indeed, the conflict in Croatia, and especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, since April 1992 has witnessed some of the worst inter-ethnic violence in the Balkans since the Second World War. This is not surprising, given the history of ethnic tensions and groups in the region, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For example, over 25 per cent of the Serb population of former Yugoslavia lives beyond the frontiers of Serbia proper, principally in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

        This bill contains a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to remove a doubt surrounding the  composition of a federal redistribution committee for a state. Redistribution committees for each state and territory subject to redistribution must be appointed `as soon as practicable' after the commencement of a redistribution. For a state, the redistribution committee must, under current legislation, include the Surveyor-General for the state, or the Deputy Surveyor-General if the Surveyor-General is  unavailable.

         However, both Queensland and Western Australia have abolished the office of Surveyor-General, leaving a doubt as to the legal composition of a redistribution committee in those states, and any others that follow a similar path. This bill provides for alternative arrangements to be made in these cases. The bill provides that, where there is no office of Surveyor-General in a state, the state minister responsible for land surveying and mapping matters may nominate the person who, in the opinion of that minister, holds the equivalent office or, if that person is unavailable, the person who holds the office equivalent to the office of Deputy Surveyor-General. If that person is also unavailable, or there is no such person, the Governor-General shall nominate a senior officer of the Australian Public Service from the state concerned. This will ensure that, under any scenario, an appropriate officer from the state concerned will serve on the redistribution committee for that state.

         —As has just been noted, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to provide that where, in a state, there is no office of Surveyor-General, the membership of a federal redistribution committee for that state may include the person who, in the opinion of the relevant state minister, holds the equivalent office. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, you, as a member of this House, would be well aware that the issue of reforms or amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act is always a matter of great sensitivity to the parliament because of its implications in relation to the democratic process.

         The opposition has been concerned that there is a definitional problem in the bill which we would like to see clarified. For that reason, I foreshadow that we will be moving an appropriate amendment. As we see it, the legislation essentially proposes that an unidentified state minister can appoint someone that he or she thinks holds an office equivalent to that of Surveyor-General to this very important responsibility; namely, federal redistribution committees. This, of course, has been caused by the fact that two states, Queensland and Western Australia, have changed their arrangements over recent years and no longer have people with the clear title of Surveyor-General.

         While this is seen as a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, nevertheless we are concerned to be in a position in which, effectively, ex officio appointments to federal redistribution committees can be made. Because of the discretion allowed to state ministers in determining who might hold such equivalent office—I might add that under the act the definition of `equivalent office' is extremely wide—we believe it would be preferable to specify the actual officers in the states of Queensland and Western Australia who should be appointed to federal redistribution committees, for example, the Director-General of Lands and the Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Lands Administration, respectively. Consequently, the opposition will be moving an amendment to that effect.

         I would also like to take this opportunity to make some general observations in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I think it is appropriate for two reasons.

I do not wish to cover the matters which will be contained in that report.

         However, a number of issues have been brought to my attention as the shadow minister responsible for the electoral act which have caused great concern to representatives of my party and the organisation of the Liberal Party across Australia in relation to the implementation of the act. I refer specifically to the problem of enrolment procedures.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Basically, the Liberal Party believes that enrolment procedures should be tightened to protect the integrity of the roll. We do this in the belief that there appears to be a premise, which is certainly applied in the Electoral Commission, that people are inherently honest and, therefore, that presumption outweighs any likelihood of people being able to use the present system for illegal purposes. In other words, they have virtually turned the principle on its head in that those of us who are concerned that in fact this may have taken place are required to prove it. I think logic would have it that those who are responsible for the safeguarding of the law should be primarily responsible for making sure that there are no likely weaknesses in the administration of the law which would permit breaches to take place.

         Consequently, the Liberal Party does not accept that, while it is mandatory for recipients of social security, for example, to open bank accounts in order to receive payments and taxpayers to have a uniform tax file number and that under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 all financial institutions are required to verify the identity of each signatory to a new account and each new signatory to an existing account, imposing suitable verification procedures for electoral enrolment should be seen as an outrageous invasion of privacy or administratively impossible. Putting it quite simply, we believe that the maintenance of accurate and honest electoral rolls is at least as worthy an objective as protecting tax revenues or preventing social security fraud.

         There are few, if any, pieces of legislation in this House of greater long-term significance than the electoral act. It is at the very basis of our democratic system. The fear on our part is that there is a growing perception in the community that there may be opportunities in the present system which could be used, if they are not being used now. The very fact that weaknesses exist would suggest that at some stage in the future an attempt may well be made to use those loopholes, if they are not already being operated on at the present time.

         In that context, we think it worth noting that under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 there are a whole range of verifications required to establish identity, but those verifications are generally not required to establish identity for voting purposes under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. For example, under the Cash Transaction Reports Act people are required to demonstrate that they are who they say they are through the use of a passport, citizenship certificate, birth certificate, written references, driver's licence, public service ID, social security card, tertiary education ID, employment ID, letter from employer, rates notice, credit-debit cards and passbooks, and Medicare card. Consideration should be given to establish a similar procedure for enrolment purposes so that we can be certain—in so far as it is possible to be certain—that a person who claims to be a valid resident and a valid voter is able to verify not only their address but also who they say they are.

         As I said, this is certainly not the situation at the present time. For example, while the card which a new voter is meant to fill out asks them details such as date of naturalisation, there is apparently no system in place which actually requires that information to be verified. In other words, we can put down almost anything we like because the risk of being caught is virtually negligible.

         That is why, when people raise these issues with us, we believe there is a problem. Cross-checking details of electoral enrolments with state government utilities and other holders of relevant information, such as Australia Post and Telecom, are options which should be given serious consideration. For example, the Electoral Commission conducts habitation reviews. We support that because it is at least an increase in the level of scrutiny of details provided to the commission by new enrollees. Surely we should have a system in place now which enables the Australian Electoral Commission to utilise the additional material which is now available to state and federal authorities and which is relevant in the determination of whether people are eligible to vote.

         Colleagues have brought to my attention the fact that, when they send out mail across their electorates, in a not insignificant number of cases they receive a reply stating that the person is not known at that address. There have even been cases where people have followed up the alleged address only to find an empty field—nobody lives there; there is no house. At some stage a person has enrolled, obviously illegally, at an address that simply does not exist. The present system has been extremely slow in picking up these things. Certainly, there is no automatic generation of information which would make verification of an elector's identity clearer.

         A possible answer to this problem—many possible answers have been put forward by many people—is the use of electoral enrolment cards. We may need to adopt the system used in the United Kingdom—I note the difference—which has a voluntary electoral system as distinct from our compulsory electoral system. Prior to an election, the electoral enrolment card is sent out to everybody on the roll. Those cards which are sent back are prima facie evidence that the people are no longer at those addresses. So, to some degree, it has a cleansing effect. People who receive a card have to hand it in when they go to vote and, in return, they will receive their ballot paper. So a one for one relationship can be established at that level. While it is true that there is no perfect system, it has been put forward that that is one of the options worthy of serious consideration.

         The Liberal Party is also of the view that the time has come for the Electoral Commission to be subject to an efficiency audit. This was referred to in the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters around the time of the 1987 election. It recommended that the Auditor-General should revise his schedule of efficiency audits to cover the AEC. To date that has not occurred. Time is passing and we believe the time has come for the Auditor-General to carry out that efficiency audit.

         Another matter worthy of consideration which has arisen from the 1993 election—we are pleased to note this—is that the commission has made progress in overcoming some bipartisan concerns regarding polling day queues, which caused difficulties at the 1990 election, and the apparent slowness of vote counting which took place in 1990. In addition to that, there was a failure to undertake the two-party preferred counts at polling booths in 1990 and quality, quantity and timeliness of data available to political parties on election night in 1990 were lacking. Most of those problems were overcome in the March 1993 election, and that is a step in the right direction.

         The Liberal Party also recommends that section 118(5) of the Electoral Act should be revised. This prevents a DRO removing a name from the roll between the issue of the writ and the close of polling, even though the DRO has already determined that the name should be removed. In other words, the DRO has established that a person is no longer eligible to vote but, as the act stands at the moment, he or she cannot do anything about it. In South Australia alone I am advised that approximately 17,000 such enrolments at the time of the 1993 federal election, at least on a prima facie basis, were not entitled to vote in the electorates where the people were apparently registered.

         There are also problems in relation to mobile polling booths. This is a matter of some bipartisan concern to party workers. Difficulties include inadequate notice; some need for management discretion as to access by scrutineers; the potential for undue influence, especially in very small communities where people working at the booth may know virtually everybody who is going to vote; and the protection of the electors' right to maintain the secrecy of their ballot. These are all issues of considerable importance. No doubt we will be looking at them in detail in the context of the next election.

The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform in 1986 supported the changes to the subdivisional voting arrangements, but there is now a strong view that it would be preferable to go back to the old system where, effectively, we could require people living at a specific address to vote at their nearest subdivision rather than giving them the open sesame arrangements which currently stand. Subdivisional voting assists in limiting the capacity for electoral fraud and, for that reason, it should be reintroduced.

         The Liberal Party also believes that the issues surrounding citizenship and offers of profit under the Crown need to be much more clearly defined. In addition, current procedures need to be simplified with a view to clearly outlining what candidates may do in order to be properly qualified to stand for parliament. Recently we have had difficulties in regard to people involved in local government who wish to stand for higher office and the status that they may have in that context. Section 326, therefore, should be given very serious consideration in that context.

         I would like to refer specifically to a number of other matters. One of the problems we have had since the election has been the question of the Labor Party's involvement in the Centenary House arrangement whereby the Commonwealth Auditor-General was taken on as a tenant. I raised this matter with the Electoral Commission to establish whether or not there could be a breach of the act—in particular, the question of section 287, which defines a gift and disposition of property.

         The important thing is that the ALP receives contributions from its company, John Curtin House Ltd, and around the time of the last election John Curtin House Ltd gave $225,000 to the ALP. My contention was that John Curtin House has received rental income from the lease of Centenary House to the Australian National Audit Office since at least 23 September 1992. This lease contains an unparalleled nine per cent ratchet clause, providing annual rental increases of nine per cent for 15 years with no downward review of the market. I raised with the Electoral Commission the question of whether or not the income received from the Australian Labor Party from this lease of Centenary House to the Australian National Audit Office could constitute a gift, as defined in section 287 of the act.

The AEC claims that it has no discretion to decide whether an election style advertisement  is a gimmick and so demands returns from anyone who spends, as I have said, over $200.

         We have reached the absurd situation where, if one puts in an advertisement, for example, that states `Election giving you a headache? Fight back', and if it cost more than $200, one has to put in a statement. A Melbourne carpet shop declared a `rug-of-war election clearance' and had to file a return. A north Ballarat sports club had to file a return for its `GST—Great Seafood on Tuesdays' advertisement. `Vote 1 Radisson Hotel; GST—Get Special Treatment; GST—Getaway Summertime Special'; `Vote 1 Dan O'Toole for GST, Greater Savings Today'; and `GST, Great Slate Tiles' were some of the other advertisements which the AEC was forced to investigate, involving a considerable cost and waste of resources.

         The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1993 contains a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to remove any doubt surrounding the composition of a federal redistribution committee for a state. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca) pointed out, the problem has arisen because the bill provides that, where there is no office of surveyor-general in a state, the state minister responsible for land surveying and mapping matters may nominate the person who, in the opinion of that minister, holds the equivalent office or, if that person is unavailable, the person who holds the office equivalent to the office of deputy surveyor-general. If that person is also unavailable, or there is no such person, the Governor-General shall nominate a senior officer of the Australian Public Service from the state concerned. This will ensure that, under any scenario, an appropriate officer from the state concerned will serve on the redistribution committee for that state. The reason for that is that problems do arise in Western Australia and Queensland. Both Queensland and Western Australia have abolished the Office of Surveyor-General, leaving a doubt as to the legal composition of a redistribution committee in those states.

        I think that is a much more satisfactory amendment than the one the opposition will place before the parliament today because it really captures everything. If there is a change in name or title in the current states which have the title Surveyor-General, the government's amendment basically picks up that position. It allows the relevant state minister to nominate the person holding the equivalent office. The problem with the opposition's amendment is that it keeps the specific title Surveyor-General for the remaining states and territories, but it then is too specific in nominating for Western Australia the Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Land Administration and, in the case of Queensland, the Director-General of Lands.

I think we should continue to place on record the tremendous effort of the former member for Prospect, Dr Dick Klugman, who in the mid-1980s devoted himself to electoral reform. Long-standing members of the House and others who have an interest in electoral reform would know that in the old days when redistributions were held, they were basically presented to the parliament and it was actually the parliament that voted on the redistribution maps. They were initially published and then there was an objection phase but it was the parliament that decided on the boundaries for members of this House. It was not till the mid-1980s that it was handed over to the Electoral Commission.

There is lot of bipartisan support for amendments to the electoral act and a lot of agreement between members of the government and the opposition. We are about trying to achieve a fair result; we are not about trying to subvert the will of the people—and that has been obvious.

         The honourable member for Bradfield and I have differences of opinion in some areas but I think those differences are really around the edges. Too often there is the perception in the community that all we do here is fight one another tooth and nail. In recent times a lot of the material that has come before us—and this is really in that category—especially in relation to electoral matters, has had bipartisan support. There is some difference of view in terms of compulsory voting and other matters and we will be arguing about those I am sure when the committee's report is tabled.

         There is very little else to say, but I repeat my earlier request to the opposition to reconsider its amendment because I do not think that it is superior to what the government is putting before the parliament this evening. For that reason I certainly will not be supporting the opposition amendment.

We were simply concerned that there was some looseness in the degree to which state ministers could determine who they wished to be the person who, in their opinion, had some functions—not all functions—relevant to the official who previously held the appropriate position. Within that context, we will proceed with our amendments.

         Australia was one of the first countries to take an interest in space. It participated in the British and United States missile development programs and then in the European space program during the 1960s and 1970s using Woomera for rocket launches. During this period Australia became only the third country in the world to build and launch its own satellite from its own soil. However, for various reasons, Australia has not been able to capitalise on the early start.

The Australian government commissioned its domestic satellite system, now operated by Optus Communications.

         Following the Madigan Report in 1985, the government formed the Australian Space Board to manage the national space program. In 1988, the board was asked by the government to review the program content of the national space program. This was conducted in 1991-92 by an expert panel. The expert panel's report,

         The functions and powers of the council are set out in part 2 of the bill. These provide for the minister to refer matters on space related science and technology to the council for inquiry and report.

         In short, the council is to add value to Australia's expenditure in space related activity and extend the opportunities for private investment and wealth creation in international markets and in import replacement. It must advise on policy and its implementation. Importantly, it must create a basis for rational cooperation between agencies responsible for public investment. The national space program has to be truly national, not just a Commonwealth program.

         Part 4 of the bill deals with constitution, meetings and committees of the council. The major user of space in Australia at the moment is the Commonwealth. However, as mentioned, this use is fragmented across many departments and agencies. It is proposed that departments with a significant interest in space be full members of the council. This will provide for a high level of coordination at the government level for the definition of public sector requirements and  contrasts with the previous space board where a number of departments had only observer status and, as a consequence, were not seen as full stakeholders in the national space program. Full membership of the council by stakeholder government departments was one of the expert panel's recommendations.

         —Space has become the great fourth domain within which Australians pursue their goals and build their future. Land, sea and air have been joined by this vast arena of expanding human activity. In the years ahead, there is no doubt whatever that these activities, both public interest and commercial, will continue to expand.

         The scale of these activities at present would surprise many who still think of space as an arena for the major powers but not for medium sized nations such as Australia. It is true that the formal government administered Australian space program is relatively modest in size with a current annual expenditure of some $6 million. Beyond that, however, the CSIRO spends some $30 million a year on space related activities. Indeed, some 19 of its 35 divisions are involved in one way or another in space.

         The NASA contract to operate the Canberra deep space communications complex at Tidbinbilla is, as has been said, worth an additional $15 million a year. The rapidly expanding telecommunications system in this country, relying increasingly as it does on satellite provided services, involves huge investments on the part of Telecom and Optus in space activities. An increasing number of Australian companies have also invested in space related technology.

         When all of this activity is taken into account, the space and space related sector in Australia may—this is one estimate that I have heard—be worth up to half a billion dollars a year, although this expenditure is obviously rather lumpy expenditure involving some large individual items. But it does indicate that space is a significant arena these days for national activities and one whose policy implications merit wide understanding and careful analysis.

         There is no single generic technology that is space technology. Instead, space equipment rests on a broad range of leading edge technologies such as electronics, communications, advanced materials, cryogenics and advanced propulsion. The space industry is closely linked to other major sectors, particularly aerospace and electronics. Nor should we think that all the space related activities of Australian industry, science and government occur in space. Much of it actually occurs on the ground in the form of ground stations or terminals connecting with satellites, and the reception and analysis of satellite data.

The international space industry has four main areas of operation: the development and manufacture of satellites for use in areas such as telecommunications, earth observation and weather forecasting; the manufacture and launch of vehicles to place these satellites in orbit; the construction of ground stations to communicate with the satellites and to receive information; and the provision of related services such as satellite tracking and control services, telecommunications and remote sensing.

         The publicly and specifically identified annual budget of the Australian space program is tiny by international standards, though the figure of $6 million is, for the reasons I have stated, misleadingly small. Sweden and Canada spend approximately $A122 million and $A270 million on their respective space programs. It would be a great mistake, however, for Australia to conclude that the scale of its program should somehow or other be based on similar rates of per capita expenditure to those in other countries. The key issue is ensuring that Australia can operate effectively in the domain of space in a way which specifically meets our needs.

         In assessing this and any other legislation which comes before this House which implements policy in this area, it is important to assess it against some fundamental policy principles. I briefly wish to outline what some of these principles are. The key role of government in the development of Australia's space related activities is to ensure that Australia's overall economic welfare is maximised. As was pointed out in the evaluation of Australia's space program by the Bureau of Industry Economics, government expenditure to assist industry is only justified from an economic perspective if the private sector would fail to generate the patterns of activities which would maximise Australia's overall economic welfare and if government can improve outcomes in a cost effective way.

         There are obvious public good and infrastructure aspects to the activities carried out in space, particularly in Australia's case in relation to mapping, communications, weather and disaster forecasting, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and public sector research. These public good and infrastructure aspects of the space program in this country have become of great significance to many Australian industries and to the whole community, allowing the more effective planning of the development of both private sector and communities.

         Conversely, it is important that government activity does not operate to squeeze out or crowd out private sector activity which might otherwise produce significant commercial returns to Australia, which could happen if government entered areas where it competed unfairly with private activities. From an economic point of view, it is vital that the space program be private sector driven and, in the evaluation of the work of the Space Council, it is a responsibility ultimately incumbent on the minister to ensure that this is the case. Again, as the Bureau of Industry Economics also pointed out, government expenditure may also be justified where there:

        Australia has developed outstanding technical skills in the CSIRO and elsewhere and there are many who will want to see Australian technology in space in the future, including instruments fully developed and built in Australia.

         In the development of a framework for the future development and planning of the space program, it is essential that the structures established avoid the twin evils of over-centralisation on the one hand and excessive fragmentation of effort on the other.

         Following the release of the Madigan report, a working party of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences, the Australian Space Board was established in 1986 to provide a more structured national space effort and manage, pending a later review, the then year-old national space program. This review was subsequently conducted by an expert panel in 1991-92. The panel was chaired by Mr Jack Curtis, former Managing Director of Telecom and Chairman of Nortel Australia. Its other members were Dr L.W. Davies, former Chief Scientist of AWA, and Professor Roy Gibson, first Director General of the European Space Agency.

The expert panel found that the development of the national space program and the performance of the Australian Space Board, while not beyond criticism, had been largely successful in developing Australian space industry capability. It found that international markets for space-derived services were expanding rapidly and that `no modern nation' could:

        The expert panel did, however, criticise the national space program for `an absence of any clear guidelines' leading to a `degree of duplication and overlap' which `militates against overall efficiency and produces a degree of waste'. It also noted that `efforts to exploit potentially significant opportunities for enhancing national welfare' were likely to be too little too late, due to the `lack of a national strategy and effective coordination'.

         The report made some 13 recommendations aimed at building on the existing industry base and taking advantage of potential future industry opportunities. Key recommendations, in addition to the creation of the Australian Space Council, included, firstly, the adoption of an integrated national space program to ensure that Australia gain net community benefits from the use of space techniques in all areas of public and private sector endeavours in which space will have an impact; secondly, an increase in funding to $20 million per annum by 1994-95 with funding assured for a period of at least five years; thirdly, a concentration on priority areas such as mobile communications, earth observation and satellite-borne instrumentation and a move away from the earlier industry development objectives which had informed the space program; fourthly, science projects supporting the integrated space program should receive regular funding not below 10 per cent of the total annual budget; and, finally, continued funding support for a limited number of space industry development centres.

         The expert panel attached great importance to the new integrated national space program which it saw, together with private sector involvement, as providing an appropriate national space capability to convert Australia into an enlightened user of space techniques and services. Although paying some lip service to the strategy outlined in the expert panel's report, it must be pointed out that the government's current commitment falls well short of that recommended in that report, particularly in financial terms. The government clearly has had some ambivalence about the space program and its performance and dimension to date and has so far, I believe, been keener to be seen to be doing something than to make any hard or significant decisions in this area. This becomes clearer when we see the recommendations that were put forward in another report produced by the Bureau of Industry Economics.

         In parallel with the expert panel report, the Australian Space Board requested that the Bureau of Industry Economics undertake an independent economic evaluation of the national space program, the essence of which was a comparison of the costs incurred by the program with the economic benefits to Australia. A common theme in support of national space programs around the world is that space activity involves a range of leading edge technologies and that countries involved in these technologies will gain long-term advantages in terms of natural competitiveness. It is said that space R&amp;D also enables industry to develop in a general sense by enhancing its technical and scientific capability. The spin-offs generated from such R&amp;D can also be considerable. However, the BIE report found that, overall, no evidence could be found:

       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para>
        The report also expressed concern at possible crowding out of the private sector activity by the value adding activities of public sector agencies. This is an area of particular concern to the coalition and, given that the Bureau of Industry Economics was unable to examine this issue in the depth it wanted to, it is certainly one which deserves further investigation and one which the council, being established by this legislation, will need to monitor.

         The Bureau of Industry Economics did find, however, that through advances in science and the application of such advances in the area of remote sensing `significant, though intangible, benefits are derived by the Australian (and to a lesser extent the international) community'. As a result of its evaluation, the BIE recommended that funding for space industry development be subsumed into general industry development programs through `the existing range of industry assistance programs'. Given this recommendation, and the fact that Australia's main space interest is in the area of remote sensing, the BIE also recommended `new coordination arrangements for remote sensing'.

It also recommended that the Australian Research Council be asked to consider whether space-related science should be designated as a priority subject area. The BIE concluded:

        The bureau concluded that is also possible that if a commercially viable global industry arises in the future, Australian companies could possibly develop commercial and competitive strengths, provided that issues relating to competition from the public sector are resolved. It is worth noting that neither the expert panel nor the government has wholeheartedly accepted the bureau's conclusions. In fact, in his second reading speech in the other place, Senator Sherry, who represented the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, made no mention of the BIE report. In the coalition's view, the overriding policy objective must be to ensure that Australia gains the maximum possible benefits from the use of space techniques.

         —The honourable member for Gippsland may think it is a bit of a joke, but I believe that space is very interesting to the majority of people who have some sort of imagination—not those who are dull in the brain. When Sputnik travelled over Australia in 1957, an Australian created a first by rushing out and taking out the world's first insurance policy against damage caused by a satellite.

         Australia has a great record in this area. In 1957 we started launching rockets at Woomera. In 1967 Australia's first satellite, Wresat, was launched, and Australia participated in a global satellite television broadcast. In 1970 the Australis-Oscar-5 satellite was launched, also from Woomera. Every day every Australian makes use of satellites and of space. Weather maps, phones, news, crop management, navigation, animal tracking, resource recovery and many other things come from space. We were at the forefront, but we have fallen behind. Excuse the pun, but I hope the Space Council will be the launching pad for our space industry.

The average time taken to locate a distress signal anywhere in Australia and around its coastal waters is around three hours. It is estimated that by 1990 more than 1,000 lives had been saved by this device. This is something that has come about through space exploration.

         Back in the 1980s we started a project called Starlab. I was very pleased to be involved with that project. I remember that I lobbied former Senator Button to make certain that money was forthcoming for the Starlab project, and much money was given to it. The project was funded by the government because of the potential that Starlab had to provide space qualifications experience to local industry, which Australia had lost due to the downturn in space activities in the 1970s. The Australian design studies for the project were well under way when the Canadian government decided to switch its space policy from Starlab to Space Station Freedom. However, the experience that we gained on Starlab was invaluable. It was used later in another project called Fuse Lyman. More recently it has been used in relation to the Hubble telescope. A lot of opportunities have been lost to Australia. Australia led the world in the 1960s in rocket guidance and optical tracking technologies. However, as activities at Woomera wound down, so did Australian research in this field. The technology was sold to Sweden to be utilised in European space programs.

Of course, this national pride can be recaptured if we start to again make our own rockets, satellites, ground stations, et cetera. We can do it. We are leaders in many areas of space technology. Our scientists are in demand all over the world. All we need is the will and an input of funds. This will kick-start a huge industry and the benefits to our nation cannot even be guessed.

         —I enter the debate today on the establishment of the Space Council because of the implications this has for the environment. I want to take a totally different approach from that of the other speakers. Australia, as has been commented, is internationally prominent and innovative as a user of remote-sensing satellites. The Australian Centre for Remote Sensing, ACRS, in Canberra, is the principal organisation responsible for receiving, archiving and distributing remote-sensing satellite data in Australia. Data is received by the ACRS antenna at the data acquisition facility in Alice Springs, and then forwarded daily to the data processing facility in Canberra, where it is catalogued and archived.

         Originally, the data came solely from the American Landsat satellite but later the French Spot satellites and the European ERS-1 radar satellite were brought in. These have added to the technology so we can actually have pictures at night and through cloud. The use of this ACRS data is particularly relevant to the environment in a whole range of areas. I will briefly touch on a couple of those areas.

         Firstly, in land management, the remote-sensing techniques provide an efficient means of assessing and monitoring the conditions of the rangelands. For instance, in Western Australia, images of the areas of severe degradation and erosion are at this moment being derived from the Landsat satellite. As well, in South Australia, a rangeland package to map grazing patterns and fodder availability has been developed, and this information is provided to graziers and pastoralists. Landsat is also used in water conservation. State water commissions use Landsat to supplement investigations into flood plain management, geological and ground water study, and increased alkalinity in soil. Landsat provides a means to monitor, at reasonably frequent intervals, the process of salinity as its spreads or wanes over vast areas of land.

         The New South Wales resources commission flood damage reduction program requires basic essential data on the inundation of flood plains, and much of this can be obtained inexpensively by remote sensing. Satellite imagery and special digital analysis techniques can be used to obtain the following information: delineation of flooded areas and floodways; the effects of levies, road embankments, irrigation channels and diversion works on flow distribution; and the performance of flood mitigation works.

         Vegetation such as forest, woodland, grassland and rangeland can be classified and larger areas can be mapped in a cost-effective manner. Aerial photography and data from digital scanning systems give resolutions that enable species composition, tree density and productivity measurements of forests to be made. Landsat imagery has been used to map vegetation types in the Mount Lofty ranges east of Adelaide and its accuracy has been better than 75 per cent.

         Landsat imagery is an important contribution to remote sensing and land resource analysis in its potential to monitor temporal changes that occur in surface conditions or land cover over extended periods. Forest defoliation caused by disease, insects, land clearing, fires and soil disturbances resulting from mining activity can all be identified on Landsat and monitored using multi-temporal imagery. The gradual deterioration in vegetation cover associated with dry conditions can also be studied using the satellite imagery.

         Finally, I refer to the uses in the environment for habitat. The remote-sensing data are used to monitor the effects on native vegetation of agricultural activities. They have also been useful in the management of insects or pests such as plague locusts. Landsat imagery has been used to identify and classify remnants of native vegetation in agricultural areas. Using colour infra-red aerial photography at a height of 1,500 metres, university researchers have developed a technique to identity wetland habitats. Because of the large scale detailed analysis of the study area, this is possible and the method complements more general  satellite surveys. Using ground test classification techniques, the researchers have established a relationship between habitat types and the distribution of eggs and larvae of the salt marsh mosquito.

         That brings me to the issue of the environment resources information network, which is within the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. This network enables all the data that is available, or can be brought into the aero-system, to be put on a computer system. An extremely important part of this is the satellite data. ERIN uses the US NOAA satellite data, which it receives every two weeks. The data it receives is an aggregate of the twice daily pass-over that is made by the satellite. ERIN takes in this raw data, which is then processed by the CSIRO Division of Oceanography. The data is used as a baseline in environmental monitoring. NOAA, as compared with Spot and Landsat, gives a one-kilometre ground resolution. Landsat has a 70-metre resolution and Spot has a 30-metre resolution. Consequently, although ERIN uses the NOAA system as its preferred system, when high resolution or local detail is necessary, the information is obtained from Spot and Landsat.

         ERIN provides a picture of the whole continent and is currently setting up a baseline in which Australia's vegetation can be monitored over time. I think we can see the environmental implications of having such a monitoring system. The baseline will be used as a reference to identify changes in the Australian environment. Our vegetation classification system will be incorporated in ERIN, which will be linked to satellite data. This will allow those using ERIN to get comprehensive information.

         The operators of ERIN are endeavouring to facilitate availability of information for environmental decision making and planning, although one problem is that information out there is not being made available to the system, partly because the information is commercially sensitive and also because some companies are reluctant to provide their information because they do not want it available on a free information basis when they feel they should be able to sell it.

         ERIN is endeavouring to facilitate the availability of information for all environmental decision making.

Once changes or patterns have been documented, environmental scientists will have the information to ask questions about causes and processes.

In fact, Australia was a pioneer in computer technology, with the CSIRO having one of the largest computers in the world by 1947. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Menzies, saw no future in computing and Australia's early advantage was abandoned in the 1950s. It is little wonder that the Woomera era came to a sudden end after the British lost interest. Put simply, if the British were no longer interested, Australia was not interested. This has proved a costly decision for the Australian space science, avionics and related research industries.

         As one of the largest users of current space technology, covering everything from weather prediction to telecommunication development, Australia has to find $300 million annually to import this technology. Regrettably, the coalition has learnt little from this history. As I said, Senator Macdonald has put all science policy on hold for the duration of this parliament. I suspect that, having failed so miserably with a definitive set of policies in Fightback, the opposition has decided to go to the country on nothing. I suspect the result will be that it will continue to be in opposition for a considerable time, being both policyless and leaderless.

         In other words, from what Senator Ian Macdonald said, the coalition has put Australia's space industry into the too-hard basket. They are unclear and unsure on this, as on many other matters. It is true that Australia's space industry has not been a major recipient of our government's funding in the last 11 years because we have been in the business of restructuring other sectors of the economy.

This would seem an insignificant sum when compared with a country like Canada which spends between $300 million and $400 million each year. However, what we are about in this bill is clear policy development with regard to space activities.

         Following a recommendation of the Madigan report in 1985, the government formed the Australian Space Board to manage the national space program. In 1988, the board reviewed the content of the national space program and from this review the expert panel was devised. The findings of this panel in 1991-92 have laid down the foundations of this bill. With the advent of the Australian Space Council, the legislative and structural framework for space activities will be set.

        I want to refer to an excellent initiative developed by the CSIRO, and that is the airborne hazard detection system. Its history is that in 1982 there was a series of dramatic incidents in which airliners flew into clouds of volcanic ash, suffered fairly significant damage and, in a couple of instances, lost power. While there were no crashes, these incidents were very dangerous and could have led to loss of life.

         As a result of these incidents in 1982, which involved various airliners from British Airways and Singapore Airlines, the CSIRO began investigating new methods of detecting volcanic ash in the atmosphere. This interest was further rekindled in 1989 when a KLM 747 flew into a volcanic ash cloud near Anchorage, Alaska, sustaining $100 million worth of damage. The Division of Atmospheric Research has recently patented the instrument. It is pleasing to see that the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development has been involved in funding part of this research.

         Listening to the contribution of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) for a few seconds, I thought that I would end up agreeing with some of his criticisms but, unfortunately, I cannot agree with them. I would like to speculate as to what might have happened if we had only followed through with that initial research. Might it have been the case that the Aussat satellites, for example, would have been manufactured and built in Australia? Australia may very well have been exporting its own Australian-made satellites. We may have had a fully developed program for launching satellites in Australia. Woomera may have been superseded by the North Queensland space launch facility that has been mooted. I can only reflect on opportunities lost.

         A very famous memo, allegedly written by Prime Minister Menzies, said that the transistor was not to be pursued in Australia again because it had little future. I suppose we cannot get all maudlin about lost opportunities, but it is a reminder to members of parliament, policy makers and people at large not to underestimate the capabilities of Australian research. In many cases, we are at the leading edge, notwithstanding the fact that, in overall terms, whilst we have a very strong public research sector, a weaker private research sector and a fairly modest aggregate, we are still able to come up with breakthroughs and innovations. That ought to be a source of pride, but I suppose this is where I differ from the honourable member for Goldstein. It is of precious little value to a country in terms of its living standards. It is of precious little value to the researchers themselves when they see these breakthroughs being made but not being fully embraced in a development process or commercialised.

         I can understand the honourable member for Goldstein saying that many researchers are dissatisfied. I do not think it is an aspect of science policy that is missing here. I sincerely believe that it is an under-commitment to research and development by Australian based firms. Notwithstanding the government's introduction of a then revolutionary scheme of 150 per cent research and development, the amount of money spent on research and development by Australian firms is very small compared with leading edge companies overseas. I believe this is a major problem. I believe that Australian business is capable of responding to this problem, but we must recognise that it is serious. We will not have a happy science environment until all aspects of the process are fully utilised and fully esteemed, and we cannot make that statement today.

As the honourable member for Capricornia pointed out, if the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has this vision splendid for science policy and believes it is so important, why is the opposition deferring this area of activity until after the next election?

         A number of members have commented that they have been disappointed by the space program. I have to say that I am one of those members. I have had a very profound admiration and respect, which I think I share with many Australians, for the contribution that former Senator Button made to Australian industry policy at aggregate level to Australia. But I cannot stand here and claim to believe that the space policies that he had, while minister, led to a resounding success. Once we have let opportunities go, it is very difficult to try to recreate them. Instead of looking at the market at large, over the last several years we have talked about what so-called niche opportunities are available for the space industry. I agree with the remarks of my good friend the parliamentary secretary about the space council. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In short, the council is to add value to Australia's expenditure in space-related activity and extend the opportunities for private investment and wealth creation in international markets and in import replacement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we would all agree with this; I certainly do. As my old friend Mr David Large, whom I am happy to say I worked with very closely in another life in communications, would know, when we were trying to look at the opportunities that were available to Australia in deregulating the communications market, we developed as a recommendation from the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Telecommunications Reform to the then minister an industry policy that set some ambitious targets. In fact, our exports were then running at about $230 million a year. We developed a policy and suggested that we ought to aim for $2 billion a year by 1996. I have always been confident in developing that target that, rather than being an ambitious one, it would be one that was overshot. But I think there is value in it. I urge the parliamentary secretary to seek from the council an estimate or a target of what this program can produce in exports.

         How should we evaluate the program? I support the parliamentary secretary's remarks in his second reading speech but, unless we can translate research into actual commercial products, we may feel very good about the quality of the research and we may have peer esteem in the scientific community for that research but, at the end of the day, a good proportion of it needs to be able to be translated through a development process and commercialised so that it is either replacing imported products or so that we are exporting and, not regrettably, niche marketing to the world at large.

         We are currently spending nearly $6 million a year on developing a space program. As the honourable member for Capricornia has pointed out, Canada, with an economy roughly twice the size of Australia, is spending something like $300 million a year on its program. I wonder what the return would be if we were to spend $12 million, $18 million, $24 million, $50 million or $100 million. I know there is a lot of pressure on government expenditure, and both the opposition and the government stand up from time to time and say how determined they are to rein in public expenditure, but what would be the returns to the country if we were to increase our expenditure on this project? An expenditure of $6 million per year is modest, and maybe it is the appropriate amount to spend. I would be very pleased if the National Space Council were to report on the matter.

A feature of our neighbours to the north is that they do indulge in long-term planning. I love quoting Indonesia because it plans 25 years ahead in five-year tranches. Unfortunately, in Australia we have made the word `planning' almost a dirty word, particularly long-term planning. Unfortunately, it is a feature of our business community that their eyes are constantly on, at the very most, 12-month cycles and often quarterly cycles; 18-month planning tends to be seriously long-term planning.

I always think that is very useful because, even with the best of intentions, whether we are talking about a space program, a car plant or telecommunications deregulation, we are never always going to get it right.

         My own fascination with space began in the 1950s as a young man growing up in the western districts of Victoria. We did not have electronic modes of entertainment in those days, and reading comics was a leisurely pastime for many a youth. The themes in those comics fell into three broad categories: detective stories, westerns, and space comics. The space comics, with their careful chronicling of great space battles and space heroes light years from the earth, evoked the mystery and fascination of a world that was far beyond one's normal human experience.

         That curiosity and fascination with space was fuelled during the 1960s with the prospect of space flight becoming a reality. The launch of the first Russian satellite was an event that propelled human consciousness into another dimension. With the first manned Russian flight in space it became apparent that mankind could reach beyond the stars. All this culminated at the end of the 1960s with the Americans succeeding in putting a man on the moon.

         It was not only our fascination with the technical possibility of further space travel that grew with these manned space flights; the popular cultures of the day began to reflect that growing awareness of space and the spin-offs, for us mere mortals on the planet earth, from engaging ourselves in this particular quest. As far as literature was concerned, we saw the rise of this science fiction genre. If I took a poll of the people in this House, I am sure that many of us who read a lot at some stage became very much addicted to the Isaac Asimovs of this world and other great writers of the science fiction genre. But it was also the electronic media that caught onto space and we saw the making of those great cult classics.

I guess there is an analogy here for the current government. We have won five elections on the trot and we look forward to going through the 1990s into the year 2000 to boldly go where no Labor government has, perhaps, gone before.

         Those events in the 1960s confirmed mankind's technological capacity to project itself beyond the home planet earth. They gave an enormous boost to the technological quest to utilise the knowledge gained through space flight to overcome some of the planet's more pressing problems.

My eyes moved to a piece of bold graffiti which was etched on the toilet wall. It said, `Beam us up, Scotty, there's no sign of life down here'. It was at that particular point that I was reminded of my own mortality—and I see the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) smiling.

Many honourable members know that people come through the door, from time to time, with interesting ideas and some of them at the time seem a little crazy. Some months ago a young man dressed very neatly in a suit, a shirt and a tie came to see me. He wanted to talk about space and space related industries. As it is very important to give access to young people and to hear their ideas—and being relatively ignorant of this particular area—I sat down and talked with him. What he said to me was very interesting.

         The young man had harboured, since his days at school, a longstanding interest in space and the development in Geelong, in the seat of Corio, of a space industry, if you like, or some firms that could spin off the development of a space program. The young man was particularly interested in small payload rockets and low orbital satellites that would perform various functions in our region. He was very knowledgeable about space and he indicated that the big players in the space game—the United States and, to a lesser extent, the Europeans—were mainly concerned with the building of larger payload rockets. He also indicated that there was a real niche in the market for firms to build low-payload rockets. Of course, he was interested in doing so and he had drawn up particular plans that he was keen to put to potential investors.

         It is those various elements that have really stimulated an ongoing interest that I have had in Australia's space program. I noted with some degree of interest that the honourable member who preceded me in this debate from this side, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), levied some criticism at the former industry minister the former senator John Button about the handling of the space program  until his resignation from the parliament. I suppose it is fair to say that more could have been done in this area, as far as stimulating Australia's involvement in the program, given our historical association with space programs. It has already been noted in the second reading speech that Australia was one of the first countries to take an interest in space. We participated with the British and the United States in their missile development programs and then, as the second reading speech notes, in the European space program during the 1960s and the 1970s when using Woomera for rocket launches.

         It is fair to say that the seeds of the Australian space industry have been historically sown, but governments and private industry have not, perhaps, watered the plants, so to speak. It is an opportune time as we enter the 1990s—and the various uses have become apparent to which space technology can be put and applied here on planet earth—to take a greater degree of interest. As a nation with a considered technological capacity in many fields ranging from engineering, medical research, environmental research to, indeed, space research itself, we ought to be taking a more active interest in this area and we ought to be pouring more resources into it.

         In the past, Australia has been a major user of space technologies. The Australian Space Council Bill basically sets up the Australian Space Council, which will have the following functions. It will have the function of advising the minister responsible for space matters on those matters relevant to the national space program and, more broadly, on policy concerning Australia's role in space. If we are going to pursue an active involvement in this particular area, not only on a national scale but on an international scale, that sort of expert advice must come to the minister who has responsibility for it.

         Another function of that particular council is to formulate and update annually a balanced five-year program of national space activities. It is logical and, indeed, it makes good sense to set up a five-year plan for our involvement in this industry. As the honourable member who preceded me in the debate has noted, the economies to our near north are doing this all the time in various areas of economic activity and in specific areas of their own economies. That is a most important and strategic function for this proposed council to undertake.

         Two things came out of the address that he made to parliamentarians who were assembled at that luncheon reception. The first point was that involvement in a national space program has an enormous capacity to inspire the youth in the space area and to encourage an awareness of the sorts of sciences and skills that are involved in a deep understanding of the space program. He spoke very encouragingly of his experience in the United States and the great pleasure that his involvement in the program had brought him because of the inspiration the nation's involvement had given to American youth.

         At the gathering of Australian parliamentarians only a few days ago, Colonel Blahas spoke about his mission on one of the space shuttles and his re-entry back to earth. He spoke not in any great depth but enough to get one excited about the unique perspective that this experience has given him as a human being. I think the human race is at a particular point in its long—some might say short—history where it needs the stimulus of new challenge, where our great scientists, engineers, environmentalists and medical researchers need a challenge that can only be provided by our involvement in something like the space program. I hope that, over time, with the government taking the bit between the teeth and resourcing this program, we might see an increase in the resources that are provided to Australia's national space program.

         A number of speakers touched on many issues affecting the development and application of space related science and technological matters. I mention that there is a trend towards the use of smaller, specialised, earth orbiting satellites for both remote sensing and communications. An interesting paper prepared by Chris Deacon, the Director of Space Communications at the Australian Space Office, refers to the fact that this new generation of small, low cost, low and medium earth orbit systems hold out the enormous promise of personal communications and services to users, not only in well-developed countries but, more pertinently, in lesser developed countries that lack an adequate basic terrestrial infrastructure and also to business users, for example in Australia, who wish to roam within the country with their hand-held portable communications units or, indeed, internationally. He mentions also that the potential in monetary terms of the application of this technology is enormous. He states:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The OECD has estimated that the annual global sale of telecommunications equipment will grow from $US135B in 1990 to about $235B by the next decade.

       <para>
        He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Telecommunications services enabled by this equipment will have an estimated value in the trillions of dollars, of which hundreds of billions of dollars can be contributed to satellites. Satellites will therefore continue to be a key element of this industry despite strong competition from other transmissions media. The migration of certain satellite voice services to fibre optics, for example, will more than be made up by the demand for telecommunications services which are unique to satellites.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be said during this debate that over the last 30 years of communications satellite evolution has been dominated by the need for bigger, more powerful and longer life satellites. But, with the tremendous jump in technology, small satellites are now seen as an alternative to the traditional large satellites. A number of small, innovative companies—there is one in south-east Queensland—are looking at this particular situation.

         Small satellites with payloads ranging from several kilograms to a hundred kilograms are being considered for many different purposes.

         These satellites are relatively cheap compared with the large geostationary satellites, which can cost up to $900 million.

         Australia must become involved in the development of this technology. Many countries are developing or have developed small satellite programs. A lot of interest is being shown, for example, by Canada and by many European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and others. In our own region Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Korea and others are showing a lot of interest in this new technology. Indonesia has been a pioneer in the use of communications satellites. It is continuing this interest by exploring the role of small satellites not only for direct broadcast compressed television and digital audio but also for personal communications.

         —The Indonesian government recently announced that minimum wage rates would rise to $2.70 per day. This was a 46 per cent increase for workers in the Jakarta region. The amount of $2.70 is a wage rate that government and opposition, big business, banks and most of the economic editors tell us we have to compete with under the euphemism of `free trade'. The religious doctrine goes like this: free traders are in favour of progress, prosperity and peace. Anyone who questions the dogma is reactionary, isolationist, immoral, promotes monopolies and a lazy unionised worker. In truth, it is the ultimate in political correctness. It ignores the fact that, over the last 20 years since this economic fundamentalism became effective, productive jobs have been exported, a lesser number of non-productive service jobs have been created, real wages have fallen, an underclass has developed, social disintegration has accelerated and corporate crime has soared, as has the disparity between the rich and poor.

         Australia now ranks the lowest among Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan and the USA in terms of share of national income for the bottom 20 per cent of the population. We also rank with the United States in having the lowest growth in the years 1970 to 1990 and the lowest percentage of the work force in manufacturing jobs—hence the difficulty in finding anything in the supermarket, department or hardware store which is Australian made.

         Under the `free trade' doctrine of comparative advantage where countries only produce in areas of natural advantage, there will be a limited choice of occupations for our children. Farming and mining employ few, there will be no timber left to cut and not everyone wants to be a waiter or be part of the huge tax avoidance industry. They cannot all work in the unproductive services and financial sectors. Free trade certainly suits multinationals and obscenely paid executives who can locate manufacturing in the lowest labour cost countries with little industrial or environmental law and externalise their costs for future generations to pay. It assumes endless growth and that consumption in the Third World at the levels of the First World can be sustained.

         Although mainstream economists have propagandised the myth of free trade for years, two highly respected American economists have recently recanted—and no wonder. America, like Australia, has faced an endlessly rising foreign debt, a relentless rise in unemployment, a shrinking middle class, a happy hunting ground for takeover merchants and a merger mania that has inexorably reduced jobs and competition, increased corporate debt and environmental degradation.

         It is notable that, in spite of the government and the media trumpeting the recent very good economic indicators, they are muted on unemployment and foreign debt because current policy gives no hope for either. In fact, there is every indication that long-term unemployment will continue at high levels, given the continuing job shedding in the name of restructuring and competitiveness. In addition, to whatever extent the economy improves, imports will accelerate and the trade imbalance will deteriorate. While ever credit is uncontrolled, debt will rise. A small economy like Australia's is an irrelevant pawn as billions of speculative international dollars flash around the world. There has to be some reregulation of the economy.

         Competitive protectionism means raising tariffs but not the crude protectionism of the Menzies era. It involves the splitting of the present many large monopolies into competitive units. No single company should be allowed to dominate the domestic market. Foreign investment should be encouraged for new ventures, not for takeovers or land speculation. Tariffs should be imposed on imports to the extent that industrial and environmental laws of the exporting countries subsidise or undercut the conditions in Australia, subject to the removal of unnecessary impediments by our governments to production. Export trade should be minimised by encouraging technology and capital transfers and minimise the heavily subsidised energy wasteful international transport. By locating manufacturing in resource rich countries, global transport can be reduced by 75 per cent with a negligible effect on global output but with massive economic and environmental gains. These are some of the directions that should replace GATT to create a new world economic order.

         —Like other members, I was very disappointed to learn today of the closure of the Ford production plant at Homebush in Sydney, much of which resides in my electorate of Lowe. Ford Australia put the decision down to reduced tariff levels and declining volumes. From August, imports from Japan will fill the Ford market. We should all be worried about this decision because it not only impacts on the 400 workers—and their families—affected but also undermines our industrial capacity and our ability to be a serious industrial nation.

         The policy of tariff reductions is supposed to help Australia. I suspect that these reductions would help if every trading country reduced its tariffs. Ford's decision to phase out its Laser and Capri production needs to be seen in its commercial context. The company intends to focus on its profitable core business in the production of Falcon, Fairmont, Fairlane, LTD and Falcon commercial vehicles. The declining volume of Ford sales, whilst still holding a high market share, is a result of an ageing population. Retirees do not buy many consumer durables like cars, and certainly not of the Laser or Capri variety. Our future as an industrial nation able to be more than a farm and a quarry requires policies that develop our industrial capabilities.

         I understand that Ford Australia has behaved very well in this difficult situation. The President of Ford Australia, Mr John Ogden, has committed the company to work with the unions and employees to help find other work. Ford will provide retraining programs and an out placement service for its employees. The Ford plant has been given six months notice. This is a very decent and civilised approach to industrial relations. Ford Australia deserves credit for the way that it has handled this most unhappy decision.

         The House should be aware that the government has a labour adjustment scheme for certain industries, including the automotive industry. Money has been contributed to that scheme: in 1991-92 it had $14.6 million, of which 40 per cent went to the passenger motor vehicle industry and in 1992-93 it had $39.9 million, of which 36 per cent went to the passenger motor vehicle industry. An amount of $31 million has been put into the 1993-94 budget. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has announced that the government has offered this to the Ford company by way of assistance so that we have this policy in place.

         Monitoring has shown that three months after completing the labour adjustment packages, 61.4 per cent of participants are in employment or non-DEET funded education and training. Up to 104 weeks assistance is available and this assistance can be taken in the form of wage subsidies to employers who employ a retrenched worker; training courses including English language, as well as vocational training; and relocation assistance to take up work. This sudden decision is a cruel psychological blow to the economy and a very cruel blow to the 400 workers and their families. I personally feel most upset at this turn of events.

         Let me share with honourable members some of the profile of this work force. A total of 417 workers will be affected: 38 as salary workers, 44 as tradespeople and 335 as non-tradespeople. Like heavy industry all over Australia, migrants are disproportionately represented at the Ford factory. For the record, the ethnic break down is one-third English speaking people, one-third Chinese and the other third is taken up by a combination of Arabic, Vietnamese and others. These people all tend to live locally so the whole area will be suddenly affected by this closure—in my electorate of Lowe and that of the adjoining electorate of Reid.

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that I had not correctly filled out my forms and had not declared my interests properly. What I had done was declare my interest as a shareholder in various companies. Some of those companies have pastoral interests and interests in land.

It is worth while noting that the Prime Minister has an interest in several companies, one being called Pleuron, another called Phalaris—although I do not think the Prime Minister would know phalaris arundinacea from any other form of phalaris.

         —I rise tonight on an issue of concern to me. I am a bit of a cook and the other day when I was preparing a meal my eyes were drawn to the label on a tin of Edgells whole peeled tomatoes. Edgells has a processing plant of some size in Tasmania. I was under the impression that all the produce that went through that plant under the name of Edgells was Tasmanian. I have always thought that when I stop at the local supermarket and buy Edgells I am buying Tasmanian products. I was pretty disgusted to read these words on the label:

        When adverse weather conditions affect supply of our Australian crop, we seek the world's best tomatoes, harvested when sunripened to perfection, rich red and full of flavour. Edgells whole peeled tomatoes are packed in tomato juice, ready to use as a side vegetable or an ingredient for snacks, stews, casseroles and many other recipe uses.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was not too worried about that. Then it lists the ingredients in the tin, the name of the company—listing a New South Wales address—but the final phrase was the one that grabbed me, and that was `Product of United States of America'. There is no doubt that there is within that label a total misconception of what is in the tin. There is nothing wrong with the products of the United States; I am sure I have indulged in some of them from time to time.

         The factory in Tasmania does not import tomatoes. Any tomatoes that are canned in Tasmania—I do not think there are any—should have the words `Product of Tasmania' on the can. This situation goes against the whole emphasis of what we are trying to achieve in the state of Tasmania, and that is  recognition of our good products on the food line.

         International companies such as Edgells wish only to have a brand name which they can sell on the international market. They process food in a uniform way, unidentifiable to a particular country, let alone a particular region. In Tasmania, we must have identification of region to gain the recognition that we need as a state and to gain international recognition for our areas.

         There is a need for farmers to have alternative supplies for the marketplace and we should be identifying each product from each region. For example, McCains sells chips all over Australia—indeed, all over the world. But they are not identified as Tasmanian. In Tasmania we are very particular about our potatoes. We grow a lot of different types of potatoes. People do not ask for potatoes in Tasmania; they ask for a particular type. The types include bismarks, kennebecs, pink eyes, brownells, tasmans, up to dates, pontiacs, sabagos and several other types.

Here is an opportunity for the world to ask for a potato by name, or at least by state or region. That is one of the aims for Tasmania which we must achieve. Likewise with tomatoes: if we can say that these are tomatoes from Tassie and this information appears on the label, it has got to value-add to Tasmania's reputation for quality.

We must keep on saying that there is nothing as good as an Australian grown product; we should not be scared to say so. I ask everybody to check the labels in their cupboards because they might be surprised at what they find.

         —I rise tonight to record a tribute to one of the great personalities of the cinema and hospitality industries, and who made a contribution not only to his chosen calling overseas but also in northern Australia. I refer to Eric Snelling, who was born in Norwich in 1909 and died in Darwin last December, at the age of 84. His wife Theo predeceased him in Bundaberg in 1977—and a son Peter in 1967.

         Eric Snelling entered the hospitality industry, managing the Carlton Cinema at Norwich in the 1930s. It was as a result of his abilities in the mid-1930s that he was asked to open one of the Channel Islands leading entertainment centres, the Regal Cinema on the island of Guernsey. This, of course, was the most inauspicious time to be coming into the industry with the outbreak of World War II looming. Guernsey was not merely subjected to the hardships of war but to the rigours of occupation by German forces.

         It was a time of positive danger made all the more so by the fact that Eric Snelling, ever one for keeping the spirits of the community up, built an illegal radio which he wired to the disconnected powerlines in his house as aerials. His projectionist—also equally dangerously—actively made up wireless sets for the other residents of Guernsey.

         After these rigours he managed the Hotel Le Chene, which is still popularly known to Guernsey tourists. The early 1950s brought him to Queensland, where he took up pineapple farming at Yeppoon. However, the call of the hospitality industry was far too great and he became the assistant manager of the then fledgling Hayman Island. He returned to Rockhampton and managed the Criterion Hotel, one of that city's great landmarks, before joining the Queensland cinema organisation Birch, Carroll and Coyle and taking over that company's Wintergarden and Earls Court cinemas.

         This period saw a golden age in cinema, with Terry Jackman of Birch, Carroll and Coyle opening a chain of theatres from Lismore to Darwin of capital-city standards and bringing a very high standard of entertainment to provincial cities. Eric Snelling was at the forefront of that movement and adapted very well when Rockhampton's first twin cinema opened. He managed it for some years before moving to Darwin and saw that city's first major cinema open. In fact, he and his wife rode out cyclone Tracy in the Darwin cinema. This building was one of the few not massively damaged by the cyclone and it provided entertainment for the rebuilding workers who had that horrendous task of getting Darwin up and going again. Many times these people were admitted to the cinema without charge.

She mentioned that a previous Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, was to blame for Australia not being ahead in computers and also for not being up on the business of space technology because he did not like it. It is nearly 30 years since the man stood in the old Parliament House; today we stand in the replacement House. The honourable member for Capricornia blamed Sir Robert Menzies for the fact that we do not have a space industry today. It was remarkable stuff. Then she said that, because the British were not interested, Sir Robert Menzies was not interested.

         We all remember the shame and embarrassment we felt when Human Rights Commissioner Brian Burdekin told us in graphic detail how we treated our mentally ill—the squalid living conditions and filthy boarding houses, the lack of support services; that when we tipped these people out of institutions, nobody really cared whether or not many had the backup care needed to cope in the real world. The saddest images were those of our youth, young people who had fallen through the cracks in society, young people struggling to cope with schizophrenia, personality disorders or the consequences of childhood sexual or physical abuse, and young and sometimes violent and antisocial youths with problems like self-mutilation or drug and alcohol addiction—all outward manifestations of internal troubles. Once these children would have ended up in our psychiatric institutions, but now many of them end up on our streets.

         In my electorate, St Stephens Lutheran Church has run a youth shelter called St Stephens House for the past nine years. For many youths, it is the end of the line. No other government shelter or agency wants them, and they have nowhere else to go. But once they get to St Stephens, whether from a psychiatric institution or off our streets, it offers them medium- to long-term accommodation with up to four other similar young people. Trained staff are on duty 24 hours a day, and counselling and support services are available. Following treatment, 60 per cent of residents will develop independent living skills and go on to play a useful role in society.

         In less than two weeks, St Stephens will close. Last year, the then state Labor government restructured its supported accommodation assistance program. The places funded for shelters which housed youths displaying challenging behaviours were incorporated into five regional centres around Adelaide. These shelters now deal collectively with youths seeking short-term and long-term accommodation. Sadly, there is no room for St Stephens and the services it offers, despite the ringing endorsement that Brian Burdekin gave the shelter after visiting it last November. He says that there is a real need for shelters like St Stephens for our mentally ill children—and here we are, closing them down. The nearest shelter, other than those offering emergency accommodation, is 30 minutes drive away.

         It will be a further two weeks before St Stephens knows whether it will be funded. That could be too late. By then, St Stephens, now running on the last funds raised by parishioners of the St Stephens Lutheran Church, because government funds have run out, will be closed. St Stephens is costly to run because of the intensive nature of its in-house and outreach services. It needs around $250,000 a year to operate. When one looks at the cost of institutionalising these young people in psychiatric care or, worse, gaols, St Stephens looks very reasonable and cost effective. Not only does it save money in the long term but it also prevents a tragic and unnecessary waste of our young lives. It was the tragic waste that led Brian Burdekin to comment on our treatment of the mentally ill, which he claims breaches international standards.

Prior to the federal election, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) spent large sums of money in my electorate, which was then a marginal Labor seat. Surely now the federal ministers for health and community services can find the money to keep St Stephens open when the lives and rehabilitation of mentally ill and disturbed youths are at stake.

I thought that maybe not many people in my electorate put applications in, and that the honourable member for Denison did a lot more work than I did.

         I went back and checked this. I found out that about $1.4 million worth of applications were put in from my electorate and about $1.2 million in applications were put in from Denison. I noticed that, out of the total applications put in from Denison, there was a 47 per cent hit rate. Out of the total applications put in from my electorate, there was a two per cent hit rate. There seems to be a slight variation—

But then I thought, `Let's have a look at the four Liberal seats versus the one Labor seat; maybe we will go over the top in those'. Warwick Smith was here and I thought that maybe he did pretty well. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who replaced Max Burr, is now here. I had a look at his electorate. He got $98,774. But the total for the four Liberal seats was only $556,924; for one Labor seat, it was $593,000.
