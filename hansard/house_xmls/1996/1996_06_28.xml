        —On indulgence, Mr Speaker: just to advise honourable members of the expected business for today, we are currently awaiting the formal processes for the Senate message re the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996, and that should be here relatively shortly in which case the debate can resume on that matter. Following that, we are also expecting the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. Both, in fact, have already been dealt with in the Senate, so it is simply a matter of the transmission of the formal documents. In the meantime, the debate on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 will continue. From time to time it will be interrupted by those messages from the Senate.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We are also proposing that there will be some procedural motions, a special adjournment and leave of absence. The remaining matter, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, is before the Senate. Whilst the Labor opposition and the government agree on the policy of the matter, there is no agreement as to expediting the debate in the Senate. We expect the Senate will commence debate on that fairly shortly, and then debate will ensue.

      <para first-indent="16">
       As soon as it becomes clear that the debate in the Senate is merely a filibuster and that the Senate will not bring the matter to a resolution in the Senate, it would obviously be no longer a necessity for us to remain sitting. There is the prospect that the Senate will deal with the matter and that it will be brought back into the House—it being a Senate initiated bill. Whilst there is the prospect that that matter can be dealt with, then it is important that the House of Representatives continues to sit. The government believes that the policy embodied in that legislation is a high priority, and we are keen to have that legislation. The unfortunate thing is that it seems to be the intention of some in the Senate to filibuster and try to talk it out

        so as to prevent the transmission of the bill to the House.

       The only other matter is that there is another procedural matter on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 (No. 2), which should not take long. Lastly, we intend to deal with the messages from the Senate and, effectively, have the natural heritage legislation as the filler in the program. However, once we have dealt with the various messages and the other procedural motions, in the time we are awaiting developments in the Senate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 there would be an opportunity to have a protracted adjournment debate in this House. It was suggested by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)—credit where credit is due—in a spirit of cooperation which is so evident from this side and, unfortunately, not evident from the other. As we have not had an opportunity to further our discussions on that, we will. If we can come to an agreement about that matter, then it would be an opportunity for debate. I know there are a number of members who wanted to speak on the adjournment during the week, but who missed the opportunity. If we can afford that opportunity, we are working to do so.

        —On indulgence, Mr Speaker: the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has always been quick to accuse us of filibustering on most items before the House. Can I get some indication as to when he thinks he might arrive at that view in relation to the Senate's deliberations, so that we can work from that and get some idea as to when this place might get up? I think it is in the interests of all that we plan for that. I understand the difficulty that he is in. But if he is of the view that they may be filibustering, at what point is he going to determine that they are?

There were various infelicities of style, for which I take full responsibility, but there was one important error—that is, the statement that attempted suicide is still a crime in the Northern Territory.

         —I welcome the opportunity, although it is a bit belated now, to speak on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. This bill is actually a 25&amp;hyphen;page ransom note. In plain English, it says, `Pass the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 or the Australian environment will suffer.' That is what it says. It is pure and simple blackmail and this bill, as I said, is the ransom note. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) was at it again yesterday at the launch of the state of the environment report when he said that no extra funding for the environment would be available unless Telstra was sold, despite the fact the report laid out in detail where there are deficiencies in the environment today.

        Very clearly, the subtext of this bill is that the coalition considers the environment expendable. It is a great shame that the crucial environmental and land management projects that are described in the bill, and they are only part of what is required, will clearly not be funded. Some $318 million, as allowed for in the bill, could be well spent on a national vegetation initiative over the next five years and $163 million, as allowed for in the bill, could usefully be committed to the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin.

        There is a need, and we agree, for a national land and water resources audit and the government should encourage the further development of a comprehensive national reserve system. The coasts and clean seas initiative is also a worthy pursuit. We on this side of the House do not question the need for such environmental funding at all, in fact our support for these projects is absolute. After all, they are mainly Labor programs and built on existing programs. But, unlike the coalition, we have never placed conditions on their
        <break page="3147" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         funding. This is a very important point: Labor never held environment funding hostage as this bill does.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party considers the environment vital and it is vital government expenditure that should now and in the future be funded directly from the consolidated revenue fund. That is the way it should be done. We see no reason at all, and none has been given, to depart from the conventional funding approach. We see no reason to establish a natural heritage trust fund at all. We see no reason for this legislation to be before the parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is common practice before any trust fund is established that its proponents demonstrate, or at least attempt to argue, that alternative arrangements are unsuitable. What is unsuitable about consolidated revenue arrangements? The government has not argued its case because it cannot. The bill is just plain unnecessary.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since coming to office, the Howard government has shown no interest at all in providing national leadership on environment matters. The signals to date indicate that their preferred approach is to remove the environment from the Commonwealth's agenda. The coalition does not even want it discussed unless it can be used as a blackmail tool. Again, we saw that yesterday with the release of a very significant report, and all the minister wants to talk about is the sale of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government not only on this issue but also on a whole range of other issues has shown no leadership at all on important environmental matters of national significance. Instead of protecting the environment their record is full of steps taken to roll back environmental protection, and after such a short time too. It seems that Senator Hill is always a couple of decisions behind the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer). Under Senator Hill's stewardship to date, the environmental agenda has been sidelined even before it got a proper hearing. The two classic examples are the proposal to undertake uranium mining in Kakadu and the government's very defensive greenhouse position, and there are many other cases.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Senator Parer is not the only government minister who manages to roll Senator Hill on the environment. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has been successful in toppling Senator Hill on woodchips and in divvying up the responsibilities referred to in this bill. Just to deal briefly with the woodchip issue, Senator Hill has already demonstrated considerable political impotence. He gets rolled by the development ministers regularly and he has shown no commitment at all to progressing the national forest policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's moves to date to disallow the current woodchip export regulations are evidence of the coalition's plans to clearly give up the reins on forest policy, to take no national leadership role, by handing it over to the states and returning to the bad old days of individual export licensing and a no holds barred approach to forest management. Basing decisions, as they are at the moment, on assertions by forest industry groups and ignoring the conservation movement on this question flies in the face of good policy and flies in the face of the `State of the Environment' report's indication of significant threats to biodiversity from current land clearing and forestry practises. Apparently Senator Hill believes the Commonwealth should exit the field. That is not national leadership; that is a government which is abandoning its responsibilities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important, I think, to mention these developments because they set the climate within which the heritage bill is to be debated. For example, the government's attempt to remove export controls on minerals: yes, that was promised during the election campaign. But the environmental consequences were never spelt out, and I doubt whether many in the community understood just what they were. Fortunately we were able to prevent that happening. But that attempt had been made in a very underhand way, without any community debate at all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I have said, we have also seen moves to increase the volume of woodchips exported—against all reasonable scientific advice. Also, we have seen a very defensive negotiating position on greenhouse emissions with talk of
         <break page="3148" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          jobs in energy intensive industries, without looking at alternative technologies, without looking at the benefits of energy efficiency—very short-sighted indeed. Of course, we have been alarmed by the apparent decision to abolish the Environment Protection Agency.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These things all cast a gloomy cloud over the development of a progressive environment policy. This legislation will apparently be the government's only commitment to the environment—and we will see that it is a very hollow commitment at that. The trust is an empty shell that will never be filled. In some ways, there is very little point in having this legislation before the House.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Yet those in the coalition are asking the public to believe that they are born&amp;hyphen;again greenies. They did that during the election campaign and some members of the public fell for it, much to their regret and chagrin now, I might say. Those in the coalition government complain about being frustrated by the parliament, as if the parliament were some sort of obstacle between them and their wishes. Indeed, they appear to be saying, `If only parliament would let us sell Telstra, our wonderfully crafted environmental credentials would shine through.' The fact is that the coalition government's record on the environment to date is pathetic, neglectful and dishonest.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are lots of shortcomings too in this legislation. There are significant issues associated with the trust planned to be established by this bill which, I think, need to be clarified, even if there were a source of funding. In particular, the opposition is concerned that, once the parliament has passed the bill to establish this so-called perpetual trust, there is actually no mechanism within the bill for the parliament to scrutinise the trust's operations or to review the program's effectiveness—an extraordinary proposition.

         The government is effectively removing the parliament's control over an important part of Commonwealth expenditure, and yet we were told that the parliament would be pre&amp;hyphen;eminent and the executive would take a back seat on some of these questions. But here we see the parliament being removed entirely from scrutiny of very important programs.

          Also, trust funds notoriously have a number of obvious shortcomings—and I quote from the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Commonwealth financial management handbook
          </emphasis>

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is difficult to see, as I said earlier, how a government which purports to be committed to the supremacy of the parliament over the executive could actually draft a bill which would diminish the parliament's ability to vet expenditure over $400 million a year. The establishment of this trust and its capacity to remove environment funding from the parliamentary and budgetary process should be resisted by this parliament and by all environmentally concerned Australians.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition believes that the bill is deficient in this area and in many others. We are also concerned about the composition of the trust's board—and I hope members opposite have actually had a look at this bill; it is very curious indeed. It provides for the board to include only two people: the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. If there is to be a trust, we believe that the limited board should be expanded to include other important stakeholders, particularly from the environment movement. I would wonder too what would happen if there were some deadlock between the ministers; how would you resolve that? Two people deadlocked would be an unhappy prospect for the environment movement if they were not able to resolve the matter, and yet there is no appropriate mechanism in this bill to resolve deadlocks.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition to reducing the parliament's control over important expenditure, trust funds are also very rigid. As the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Commonwealth financial management handbook
          </emphasis>
          states:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The purpose for which a trust account was established cannot be changed. If at some stage it proves necessary to expand or to modify the purposes of a trust account, the account must be closed, the

          So it is not a very flexible vehicle either. The government's claim, therefore, of establishing a perpetual trust is nonsense. It is not possible for the government, or anyone else for that matter, to predict the environmental problems of Australia in the future or, indeed, the priority they should be assigned. The nation's environmental priorities will change in the future. The trust will need to be modified and, consequently, will have to be closed and the balance repaid to consolidated revenue. These requirements indicate the futility of establishing a perpetual environment trust in the way described in this bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Clearly, the superior approach is to fund environment programs directly from the consolidated revenue fund. We have heard no argument why that should not be done. This is the funding approach clearly favoured by the opposition and, indeed, applying in the past to environment and other funding.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the things about this bill worth mentioning in passing is that it makes reference to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996 as a way of ensuring proper financial accountability of the trust. I might say that that is a bill we have not yet seen. So the parliament is being asked to take on trust that there will be adequate precautions taken, and yet we do not know in what they will consist.

          We have further technical concerns with this bill, particularly the bill's references to investment in natural capital, as it is called. The government has persistently described a range of programs to be funded in this bill as capital projects. The Australian Bureau of Statistics document
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Government finance statistics, Australia—concepts, sources and methods 1994—
          </emphasis>
          which I think is a reliable source—defines capital transactions as:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Payments or receipts for the acquisition, construction or sale—
         </para>
         <para>
          and I repeat: acquisition, construction or sale—
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para font-size="-=2">
           of non-financial assets which are to be used for more than one year in the process of production. All other non-repayable transactions are regarded as current.
          </para>
          <para>
           Using this definition, let us just examine one by one the five projects referred to in this bill. The national vegetation initiative, you would have to say, is something that is not going to be a one-off capital expenditure in the way described. It is something that will need to go on. In the past it has been funded as a recurrent expenditure and has all the characteristics of normal recurrent expenditure. Similarly, the Murray-Darling Basin initiative is not a one-off acquisition, construction or sale of a non-financial asset. It is basically an ongoing long&amp;hyphen;term program. The national land and water resource audit is definitely  recurrent expenditure and does not have any of the characteristics ascribed to capital.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           While you might say that the national reserve system, particularly in acquisition, may have some of those features, there are others that do not, particularly the management aspect. And the coast and clean seas initiative, by anyone else's definition, would be seen as recurrent and not capital expenditure. So despite the coalition's rhetoric, there is no element of this bill which can be simply defined as capital expenditure.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           You might wonder why they do it. The bill's shonky definition of capital expenditure actually exposes the government's attempts to hide the inherent contradiction between the coalition's privatisation election promise and its environment election promise: and it is an unhappy compromise. The coalition's privatisation policy asserts that `proceeds of privatisation will not be used to fund recurrent expenditure.' So they just redefine it. They change the meaning of the word. The government clearly faces a dilemma. How can it reconcile its privatisation election promise with its environment election promises? The simple fact is—this bill demonstrates it—that they cannot. The promises are contradictory. So what do they do? They ignore the facts and blindly assert that the projects represent an investment in natural capital. This is clearly blatantly misleading. Not only are they breaking an election promise; they are also prepared to change government accountancy
           <break page="3150" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            definitions to cover their tracks and hope that the Australian people will be none the wiser.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The Telstra environment scam—I think that is the only way you can describe it—exposes the government's intention to use smoke and mirrors accounting tricks to hide their broken promises. It really requires a fantastic leap of faith to accept the proposition, for example, that the national land and water resources audit is capital expenditure.

           As I have already indicated, the coalition has made a big song and dance about its commitment to the environment. Mind you, it is sounding a bit limp lately. When the smoke clears, this supposed commitment will not have been translated into expanding and strengthening the environment department. Indeed, we are told that sections of the department are likely to be abolished, including the EPA, a very important section.

           It seems odd that the environment minister will be the minister responsible for preparing and tabling the trust's annual report—that is what this bill tells us—but he will be responsible, it turns out, for less than 20 per cent of the trust's funds. It starts to lose the character of an environment fund. The remaining 80 per cent will be managed by Minister Anderson's department. The only initiative Senator Hill will be responsible for is the national reserve system—less than 20 per cent.

           It is misleading to refer to the trust as an environment package. In fact, if you look at it closely, it is a land management package with a very small environment component—and that in the face of this baseline data which we now have about the need to repair the Australian environment.

           A critically important policy area such as the environment clearly requires an ongoing commitment from government for certainty of funding from the consolidated revenue fund. That is our very clear position. Anything short of this exposes a lack of commitment and a desire to downgrade the importance of the environment portfolio. I don't think any other conclusion can be reached.

           Note, interestingly, that he didn't say `part privatisation' at that point. Maybe he let something slip. This was then, and is now, an absolute con of the Australian community.

           The following figures convincingly debunk the  coalition's claims that their environment commitment was twice the commitment Labor made. It was something that appealed to the conservation movement. The Labor Party's total commitment to environment and land management programs over the four years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 was indeed $1,588 million. That is what we committed. That funding amount represents Labor's forward estimates of some $609 million plus Labor's land management forward estimates of $509 million plus Labor's land package announced before the election of $470 million. Over the four years this translates into some $397 million per year towards environment and land management programs—responsible promises.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The coalition is committed to $1,970 million over four years. That comprises Labor's budgeted environment expenditure—after all, they said they would maintain that—of $1,118 million plus the $852 million worth of promises they made during the election campaign. If you work this out, over the four years that translates into some $493 million

           The annual difference, therefore, between the coalition's environment commitment and Labor's environment commitment is $96 million. That is what you ask to sell Telstra for—$8 billion to buy $96 million extra per year. That is a very generous interpretation indeed, because it assumes that the current government will actually leave the existing programs and expenditure in place. In my view, the difference will disappear altogether after the budget when the coalition cuts many core environment programs, such as the Environment Protection Agency, and slashes departmental running costs.

           On the landcare side, we have already seen some cuts which are having effects in regional Australia. I am sure members will be aware of the fact, for instance, that Landcare Tasmania have already been told that they are about to lose 25 per cent of their funding from the Commonwealth government. This would mean the loss of three full-time regional landcare officers, a vegetation adviser, an education officer, a river engineer and parts of the whole farm planning program. You cannot lose 25 per cent of your funds without that sort of effect. In my view, by the time we get to the budget a lot of these funds will already be gone and that $96 million difference will have  disappeared. In other words, the increase is a mirage. It will never eventuate in any case because Telstra won't be sold. So we have a promise here that can never be met.

           Despite their election commitment to match Labor's budgeted funding for the environment on top of the Natural Heritage Trust, Senator Hill—and he has been questioned on this—has actually refused to rule out massive cuts to current environment program expenditure.

           When asked in the Senate, Senator Hill basically avoided the question. Is he saying that the expenditure in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia is sacrosanct—that one little bit—but other environmental programs can be damned? What he is saying is that the

          <para first-indent="16">
           The other important difference between Labor and the coalition government is that Labor's expenditure was secure. It was not contingent on the sale of Telstra. Those figures I have just outlined and the certainty of cuts to the environment in the budget clearly debunk the coalition's claims that this is `the biggest and best environment package in Australia's history'. Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Bob Brown described it very correctly as `a modest package'. Indeed, it is a modest package dressed up in trust fund clothes. We simply should not fall for that trick. In reality, it is a funding mirage—it will never eventuate because Telstra will never be sold. The Australian people simply do not want it to be sold and they do not accept that link.

           The government is also fond of claiming that green groups support the Telstra&amp;hyphen;environment link. We have had that said here by many ministers. They continually cite the Surfriders Association as a conservation group which supports them.

           The truth is that the list of groups opposing the link is long, and their opposition is very strong, and growing. Take the Friends of the Earth, which put out a media statement on 18 June 1996 when they saw this bill. I will quote from the statement, headed `Telstra blackmail fails again', at some length because it summarises the community's opposition to the government's plan very succinctly:

            Friends of the Earth, a national environment organisation, has consistently opposed the cynical deal that would link funding of the Trust Fund with privatisation of a publicly owned asset.

We strongly reject Senator Hill's statement that to oppose the sale means a `lack of understanding of the environment crisis facing Australia'. We are all in agreement about the depth of the crisis—we disagree on the `remedy'—we need long term commitment, no short&amp;hyphen;term deals.

            As I have outlined, the opposition has a number of major concerns with this bill. First, its objective is not to ensure the Australian environment is protected and conserved—that is its last objective. Its objective is to ensure that the Telstra bill is passed by the Senate. It is such a transparent ruse that I do not believe anyone will fall for it. The opposition will certainly not succumb to this blackmail and we, therefore, are going to be moving amendments to remove any reference to Telstra from this bill.

           <para first-indent="16">
            Secondly, the opposition questions the bill's reference to capital programs, as I have already outlined. The initiatives to be funded by the partial sale of Telstra are simply not capital programs. Reference to these initiatives as capital projects has the potential to set a very unhealthy precedent. The coalition has blurred the capital definitions in the hope of disguising the fact that they are breaking a significant election promise made in their privatisation policy. The opposition will move amendments to remove from the bill any mention that these initiatives are capital projects, simply because they are not.
           </para>

            Thirdly, as I indicated, the opposition is concerned about the proposed management of
            <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
             the fund. The Natural Heritage Board is not really a `board' at all; in fact, it is more like a junta. As it stands, this bill would hand over the environmental policy reins to two ministers and forever eliminate any opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of their activities. That is the extraordinary outcome. That is unprecedented, undemocratic and just plain wrong. We see the need for the board to be expanded and to allow greater community input. After all, the community is asked to take on many of the projects that are outlined in the bill.

            Fourthly, the trust's establishment removes environment funding, as I have said, from parliamentary and budget processes. This, in my view, should be resisted by the parliament and by all environmentally concerned Australians. Why should we not know what is going on with these very important projects in the same way as we do with others?

            The opposition calls on the minister to ensure that the trust's expenditure is part of the normal budgeting processes, including Senate estimates. I understand that further funds might be put under the control of the trust. We could have the position where eventually all environment and land management programs are outside parliamentary scrutiny. In my view, the trust must be accountable to parliament. It is irresponsible of the government to have drafted a bill which diminishes the role of parliament in this way. To ensure that the parliament maintains some influence over environmental matters, the opposition will amend the bill at least to include a sunset clause.

The initiative represents $318 million over a five&amp;hyphen;year period. In states like South Australia with high levels of desertification this initiative is of particular importance. It is currently estimated that over 50 per cent of Australia's land is now in need of some form of repair. It is also estimated that current community demand for funding to

        The government's program has a target for revegetation of 250,000 hectares nationally. South Australia already leads the way nationally in controlling broadacre clearance, but there remains much to be done in the way of revegetation. The long-term objective of achieving a rate of revegetation re&amp;hyphen;establishment exceeding the rate of clearance is strongly supported and South Australia is rapidly approaching this target.

        Funding through this program will assist groups such as the South Australian Department of the Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Primary Industries, Landcare—of which one in three farmers are members—Greening Australia and Trees for Life to cooperatively achieve this goal. Commonwealth funding will greatly assist in bolstering existing revegetation programs and the establishment of further revegetation programs in our agricultural regions. The need for direct seeding programs in the mid&amp;hyphen;north of the state, on Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas and in the Flinders Ranges, could be targets of such funding.

The coasts and clean seas initiative, with a commitment of $100 million over four years, will however greatly assist in tackling the difficult environmental problems facing South Australia's coasts and oceans.

They were never closed off, and no legislation will go through to close them off.

The Democrats in the Senate tacked onto it a proposal that had altogether different subject matter—namely, infrastructure borrowings—and said that they would only allow the development allowance reconfiguration proposal if infrastructure borrowings for urban roads were prevented. That is not our policy. We believe that if infrastructure borrowings have a place, they have a place in relation to all of those projects.

        The Treasurer knows these things full well. His only excuse on this matter, his only defence on this matter, is the Downer defence, which is basically to say, `Because I'm foolish, I'm innocent.

         —The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) can rant and rave all he likes in this House. It is very clear that he wants to deal with infrastructure borrowings to save his mate in New South Wales from having to face the prospect of another tollway. He is not the slightest bit interested in any of the fiscal consolidation arguments that he might argue about. He is not the slightest bit interested in anything other than not allowing the Premier of New South Wales, who has some 24 per cent acceptance by the business community I note this morning from the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         report, to face a tollway. He is not the slightest bit concerned about the jobs that he is destroying in terms of the development allowance and he is siding with the Democrats, as is the entire Labor Party, to simply destroy the prospects through the development allowance of the 40 projects worth $2&amp;half; billion over the next six years. They will create jobs.

         The amendments that have come from the Senate have absolutely nothing to do with the development allowance. Labor relies in this debate on the EPAC report. They conveniently forget in their selective quoting of the EPAC report that even that report—whether you agree with it in its entirety or not—said not to do anything until 1997&amp;hyphen;98. That is when the report said it should be done.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That EPAC report also said that in 1969&amp;hyphen;70 the actual investment in infrastructure represented nine per cent of GDP. By 1993&amp;hyphen;94, public investment generally in infrastructure had gone down to 4&amp;half; per cent of GDP. It pointed out the capacity of governments, the capacity of the public sector, to get involved, to find the revenue in infrastructure was very limited in view of the fiscal constraints that are around.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We know all about fiscal constraint because we have got that $8 billion black hole. The Labor Party is saying, `We don't want any new roads in any city. We certainly do not want the eastern distributor. We do not want Sydney to have some sort of traffic flow by the year 2000 when the Olympics are there.' The Labor Party wants to present that city to the world in a way which is going to send home with all those visitors a memory that you cannot move through Sydney, otherwise the one slim chance of the Premier of New South Wales holding one Labor government together at the next election before the year 2000 will disappear immediately.

         The Labor Party in New South Wales lied to the people of New South Wales about removing tollways. They had no intentions ever of doing it. They knew they would lose their AAA rating the moment they attempted to do so and they have tried to hide behind it ever since. These silly, spiteful and irresponsible amendments are going to destroy jobs and they are going to prevent infrastructure in the city of Sydney and elsewhere in our big cities around Australia in the next few years. It is all designed for base political purposes.

         What will happen is that the bill presented by Labor and supported by this government for development allowances will not proceed, 40 projects will not get the benefit of the jobs that come from that, and we will find that the

          infrastructure in terms of tollways or otherwise in urban roads will not continue. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said, nothing is achieved by this mixture of logic that seems to be based on the fact that an announcement on a totally unrelated issue was made by the Treasurer this week and that if he had held off for a day or two all of this could have gone through and we could have all gone home. But no, because he chose to announce it at a particular time, they jump in and take advantage to save their mates in New South Wales. They do not save their mates through the amendments before this chamber. Urban roads will be allowed to proceed on the basis of infrastructure borrowings. There is no legislation to prevent that and, in the meantime, a very sensible bill, presented initially by the Labor Party and supported by the government to allow for the development allowances, will not proceed.

         As a result of its not proceeding, we put at risk $2&amp;half; billion worth of projects around Australia—mainly in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia—in the tourism area, in the mining industry, in the manufacturing area. All of that stops; all of that goes. Is it any wonder that the business community of Australia have no respect for Labor? Their inconsistency and their lack of credibility are demonstrated so well in this debate and it is all for base political purposes. It achieves absolutely nothing. It simply means that Labor has no policies, no consistency in all that it does and it is here to obstruct. It allows the tail to wag the dog in the Senate and it goes along with it in this House.

        The government agrees to the requested amendments moved in the other place. The requests relate to items 55, 57 and 60 in schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act. The amendments propose to remove the three per cent duty rate increase on these three policy by&amp;hyphen;law items and restore the free rate of duty to these items. While it is conceded that the request does not implement the complete rate increase proposed by the government for the policy by&amp;hyphen;law items, in order for this substantive bill to be passed the government is prepared to accept the requested amendments.

         —We welcome the government's indication that they will accede to these new amendments to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. These amendments build on the amendments which they accepted yesterday and now fully reflect the amendments we proposed in this House last Tuesday week to this legislation. Last week, they sought to introduce changes to the tariff concession orders that, amongst other things, would have seen the introduction of a new consumer tax on imports. Despite election pledges that there would be no new taxes, and against our opposition, they put through this parliament last week the introduction of a new consumer tax. That move was rejected by the Senate, which supported our amendment. We dealt with that matter yesterday.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In speaking to this matter yesterday, I indicated that there was still an issue that we felt needed further amendment. That was to ensure that the policy by-laws mechanism, the mechanism whereby business could still access a zero tariff rating, effectively would be expanded. It was proposed in the government's bill to introduce not just the three per cent tax on consumers but a new
        <break page="3163" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         three per cent policy by-law rate. Under Labor, the policy by-law rate effectively enabled a zero rating. So we had not only the introduction of the consumer tax by stealth but also the closing off of an avenue to business to get some relief, some zero tariff rating.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yesterday, we argued that the policy by-law rate should still stand at zero. The message that came back from the Senate yesterday was that the policy by-law zero rating applied to a number of categories but not all. Essentially, it applied simply to major projects. It did not apply to sections of the manufacturing industry that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has now just alluded to and to participants in the manufacturing industry in both small to medium sized enterprises. So we moved in the Senate that the policy by-law zero rating be extended to cover those manufacturing groups. I am pleased to say that the groups that are now picked up are machine tools for working advanced materials, raw materials and intermediate goods where the imported goods are given a performance advantage over the substitutable goods produced here and metal materials and goods in food packaging.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The effect of these amendments, as I said at the outset, is to implement the full extent of the opposition's second reading amendment to this bill last Tuesday. It is unfortunate that it has taken us until the last hours of this session of parliament to get this bill through since we gave the government the opportunity to amend it as far back as last Tuesday week.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The significance of this amendment is that it is not only a win for the opposition and a win for consumers and a further advantage to business but also a very significant and comprehensive win for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) over his Treasurer (Mr Costello).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         One might recall that it was the minister who argued that the rates on business should be dropped. He succeeded in that. But what the Treasurer sought as the quid pro quo was the extension to consumers and the lifting of the policy by-law rate. These amendments effectively wipe out the quid pro quo. So the Peter Costello quid pro quo has been elimi nated by this step. It is a good piece of policy, we welcome the government's commitment to adopt it; consumers will be better off, and there are improved benefits for industry arising from it.

        The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who was speaking just before the debate was interrupted, simply reiterated the blackmail which is part of the bill. She went on with a long description of the environmental benefits which this bill is  claimed to facilitate, but that is really not a rationale for the bill at all. This is a bill about hypothecating funds from the sale of an asset for recurrent outlays. It is quite an economically irresponsible bill, just as it is a serious misjudgment about the way in which responsible environmental policy should be funded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Adelaide did not debate at all the basis for this legislation. It was really quite an inadequate defence of the legislation. That is a pity because, quite clearly, she herself has a serious commitment to the environment. It is regrettable that she has fallen into the trap of supporting what is a misjudged hypothecation rather than supporting proper, appropriate and responsible funding for high priority environmental projects. To have just reiterated, as she did, the pork barrelling that the now government went on

        This bill is a lightweight bill. If you look through it, it looks as though it has been hastily drafted by a government which does not seriously expect it to be passed through both houses. It looks as though it does not seriously expect the bill will be implemented. For example, why is there this device for a trust with two trustees, two ministers? There is no mechanism for scrutiny of the bill by parliament, as the Labor shadow minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), mentioned. Scrutiny by parliament is a vital element of any area of public policy. Setting up a trust of this kind without explicitly providing for scrutiny undermines the responsibility of parliament to properly control public funds. That does not look as though it has been thought of. The bill has been hastily drafted, not seriously drafted as  responsible public finance policy. The bill, therefore, diminishes the capacity of parliament to review expenditure. Expenditure through this trust would be about $400 million a year.

        Another problem with trusts is that they are very rigid. They can only act according to their specified objectives at the time that they are established. If those objectives are to be changed or widened, then the trust has to be abolished, the funds dispersed and a new trust established. That kind of rigidity is again anathema in the context of sound public finance policy.

        The bill has been thrown together. It is a lightweight bill; it is not fully responsible. It is done by a government which says it is an example of its own environmental credentials, but it is a government which has already demonstrated, in the first three months or so of government, that it does not have sound
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         environmental credentials. For example, within weeks of being elected the government had moved to remove export controls on minerals—a policy which would have enabled the government to allow unfettered access for mining companies to mineral deposits and exports regardless of the environmental consequences. Yet it was just that capacity to control and approve export arrangements for minerals which allowed the Fraser government to stop sandmining on Fraser Island—something which has been a significant achievement in environmental security.

        This government has also already indicated that it is seriously considering introducing further uranium mining in Kakadu. Kakadu, of which Australians are uniformly proud, is one of the two or three best managed environmental protected areas in Australia and the government is proposing to allow more of the park to be destroyed and the integrity of the park to be broken by allowing further uranium mining, which again the majority of Australians do not want to see. We are concerned about the implications for nuclear weapons proliferation, which export of uranium would facilitate. Again, the government is acting irresponsibly towards one of our most beautiful and high quality protected areas and in a way that would allow it to be spoiled.

        Those opposite are talking also about removing export regulations on woodchips, something that has been an area of massive controversy and about which the previous Labor government had reached a relatively satisfactory compromise after some years of debate. That carefully and delicately arranged compromise, which was reached after prolonged negotiation and discussion with both forest industries and concerned environmentalists, the new government is planning to break. This is really irresponsible stuff. I could go on and on. The point is that this government now does not have serious environmental credentials, and this irresponsible bill is a clear demonstration of that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me come to why this bill is so irresponsible. The bill is based on the sale of a third of Telstra. You meet people all over the community who recognise what a cynical exercise this is. They know that Telstra
        <break page="3165" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         produces substantial profits every year. They know that the sale of a third of Telstra will reduce the returns to the community, not increase them. The government also know that, if the whole of Telstra were kept in public ownership, as required by good economic and sound competition policy—because that is the basis for maximising the intensity of that competition between Telstra, Optus and other telecommunications companies—it would allow them to act as the responsible owner of that vital enterprise, ensuring that its operations were run efficiently and competitively and that the revenue it generated would be used effectively within the normal approaches of consolidated revenue.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But if we have the sale of a third of Telstra then we have conflict between private owners and public owners. There is much less capacity for government to control it fully and carefully and be wholly responsible for what Telstra does. The one&amp;hyphen;third would tend to dominate the two-thirds. It is neither one thing nor another. It is a recipe for conflict, for misjudged policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Also, it is a recipe for further privatisation in the future. Who believes all this protestation about selling one-third now and that would be all? No-one seriously believes that. If a third were sold now, another third would be gone a year or two later and the rest a year or two after that. It is clearly being proposed by a government which plans to privatise the whole of Telstra. If that were to happen, then the only way the funds could be raised would be if part of them were raised overseas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If that were to happen and part of those funds were raised overseas, it would mean selling part of Telstra to foreign investors. That would mean repudiating government concern for the interests of consumers, because no privately owned telecommunications company would give anywhere near the same degree of attention to community interests that a government owned enterprise would give. It would involve giving up a lot of Telstra's good work on research and development, on innovation, on expansion of export markets. Telstra has been very active in promoting sales of its expertise overseas which contributes to the growth of Australian
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         exports of goods and services, yet partial privatisation would tend to undermine that activity.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra is economically irresponsible and politically inept because the majority of the community want to keep it in public ownership—and that is because the majority of the community understands that there are greater benefits for the community now and in the long term if it is kept wholly in public ownership. This is an unprecedented piece of blackmail. It contributes to the erosion of confidence in government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another central point that I want to come to is that the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra is not necessary. The government is arguing that it ought to sell a third of Telstra in order to raise the funds to protect the environment. But that involves selling a capital asset in order to provide funds for recurrent outlays. That is not only economically irresponsible but also unnecessary because the funds are much more appropriately raised through consolidated revenue, through the revenue generation system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's argument is that there is an alleged black hole, a so-called black hole that it found when it came into government. This is simply not so. That alleged black hole is due to some changes in estimates in connection with the rate of inflation and the rate of economic growth which were made by the Treasury rather hastily and without normal care in the first week after the election. The estimates show that the Treasury officers expect the rate of inflation to fall, something which is entirely desirable. That accounts for about half the alleged claim for a reduction in revenue. They claim that the other half is due to an alleged fall in the rate of economic growth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since those estimates were made, we have already seen the rate of economic growth in the first quarter of the year remain much higher than was built into those estimates. That means that at least part of that alleged black hole no longer exists—if it ever did—because the base on which the revenue estimates for next year are now calculated is higher. This means that next year's revenue
        <break page="3166" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         will certainly be higher than the estimates made by the Treasury straight after the election.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well as that, those estimates were clearly very approximate. Other skilled econometricians have made alternative estimates which suggest faster economic growth in the coming financial year—which starts on Monday, by the way—than the Treasury was forecasting straight after the election. Therefore, there will be faster growth of revenue and, therefore, slower growth of outlays because of the slower growth of unemployment benefit payments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That alleged gap is certainly significantly smaller than was claimed in March. We will see when the budget comes down in August what revisions have been made, but it seems highly likely that the alleged gap will be considerably smaller than was claimed.

        If the government want to fund improvements in environmental protection, as they certainly should—I will come to that in a minute, too—then they should do so in the proper way, through consolidated revenue without hypothecating the sale of a capital asset and allocating that to recurrent outlays.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Before finishing, I will dwell on one of the areas of expenditure that is set down in this bill. Many of them are very important. As the shadow spokesperson said, every area that is outlined there is worth doing. It is not a question that they are not worth doing. They are all worth doing, but they all ought to be funded more responsibly and on a more permanent basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The one I particularly want to mention is the national reserve system. That policy comes from the recommendation of the House environment committee, which did an inquiry into Australia's biodiversity. We found that Australia's biodiversity is seriously threatened. Already, in the 200 years or so since European settlement, there have been quite a number of extinctions of animals, birds and plants, and a whole series more are endangered and many more are vulnerable. In that context, we need to find ways of protecting biodiversity. The most obvious and important way is to have a nationally representative protected area system which ensures that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         every major type of ecosystem is represented within the protected area system so that their survival becomes assured. Our aim should be ecological security, in other words.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We recommended a process, a scientific basis, for deciding which areas should be protected—a bioregional approach, it is called—and on that basis we proposed funding of $200 million over five years: part through the states, part through the Commonwealth; part for establishing the system and part for funding maintenance of the system. In response to our recommendation, the previous government accepted most of our ideas. In the major environmental statement in January, the then Prime Minister announced an additional $80 million, set aside for building up the national protected area system, and proposed that that would be provided in conjunction with the states, who would also be expected to provide another $80 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The then opposition, now government, picked up that recommendation in its entirety and identically included it in its environment package, so it is part of this bill we are now debating. I am glad to see that the government picks up that recommendation because it is a centrally important one. If we do not protect our biodiversity, then it will not survive. More plants, more birds and more animals will be killed off and will become extinct. That would be a national tragedy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We do have a responsibility to future generations to protect our ecosystem and to have an expansion of the national protected area system so that it is fully representative and not very erratically and very inadequately representative as at present. That is a necessary part of that. That needs to be funded appropriately through consolidated revenue so that there is a permanent basis for the funding, so that maintenance and management can be assured in the future and so that future generations have the pleasure and the real joy of enjoying Australia's natural heritage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I conclude by emphasising that it is vital that the funding of these environmental programs be soundly based. This bill does not provide for that. It is important, therefore, to
        <break page="3167" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         reject this bill and replace it with a much more responsible public finance basis for ensuring environmental security, and to reject the sale of Telstra.

There is not another election for a couple of years, is there? Unless you are interested in a double dissolution. This is not a double dissolution trigger.

          I would not be getting up opposing this if there were no value in us dealing with this bill. There is value. The great tragedy is that the Leader of the House—he is obviously enthusiastic in his new role—does not understand the forms and procedures of this House. That is why we are opposing this bill being discharged. If we discharge this, 80 per cent of something that we all agree to will be kicked around between the House of Representatives and the Senate for the next 18 months. I understand that the bill that we sent to the Senate last night will not even be reaching the Senate today because they are debating another bill.

         —I join with the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in opposing the discharge of this item from the agenda. I think it is important that the House understand what has been done here. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 (No. 2) that was guillotined through this parliament last night was the same bill that started in the Senate some weeks ago, which the Senate has debated, deliberated upon, amended and returned to this parliament. We are now effectively dealing with the message.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To essentially move this motion that you discharge it means that you are rejecting everything that the Senate has considered in detail on this bill. Let us just understand the significance of that. We have a government that came to power saying they were going to lift the standards of parliament; they were going to make parliament more supreme than the executive; they were going to make the parliament more accountable. Yet what are the facts? They guillotine—in other words, fast&amp;hyphen;track—the bill through the lower house and ignore the detailed consideration that it has already been given in the upper house. It is utter nonsense. It makes a complete sham of all those high moral principles they talked about when saying they wanted to lift the standards in the place. There may well be all sorts of motives, but can they really stack up
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         against the notion that you are going to make the parliament more accountable?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us have a look at the other areas in which the standards of this parliament have not only not been lifted in the course of this new government but have been debased. The most noticeable is that we now have a foreign minister who has misled this parliament—not just once but on four occasions. He has admitted to having misled the parliament; his Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has admitted to misleading the parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister came in with a code of conduct and said, `Ministers shall not mislead the parliament and, if they do it inadvertently, they should correct the record at the earliest possible opportunity.' That is the code of conduct that the Prime Minister said he wanted his ministers to operate by. Yet that did not happen. Not only did we have the parliament misled four times, we did not have the record corrected until the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) came into this parliament two days ago to correct it. But coming into the parliament to correct it—from the initial misleading of the parliament—took him five sitting days. The first misleading of the parliament was on 18 June; the second was on the Monday of this week; the third was on the Tuesday of this week; and the fourth was on the Wednesday of this week—before he corrected the record.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is another example of where a government that prides itself on lifting the standards has failed dismally. The previous decision by the Prime Minister to require the resignation of his shadow minister for the environment for inadvertently misleading the parliament has not been implemented in the case of the foreign minister. These were things that were demanded of us when we were in government. We had a number of ministers that did resign when they inadvertently misled the parliament. Not only have we not got the foreign minister having resigned; we have a situation in which the Prime Minister says he wants to lift the standards—not just equate to them but lift them. By any standards, the foreign minister should have resigned. That is another example of how this parliament, and
        <break page="3171" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         what it stands for, is being abused by the current government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another example is that in the life of this government there have been six sitting weeks of parliament—we are about to go into the recess before we come back for the budget session—where we have had the guillotine and gag imposed seven times. Understand what that means. For a parliament that you say has to be supreme and given the opportunity for open debate for consideration of all the issues, why move the guillotine and the gag, the very purpose of which is to restrict debate, to limit the time, to close off the opposition in what it can say and move?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There may be a view on the other side of the parliament that what we get into is filibustering, but the reality is that, when you are stopping amendments even being put in the parliament, it just makes a sham of your assertion that you want the parliament to consider all matters. An example of one of those guillotines is the Telstra debate—no insignificant issue. This is the selling of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra, one&amp;hyphen;third of a public asset. The opposition had a number of amendments it wanted to move and it was not given the opportunity to move one of those amendments—not one! How can you argue that the parliament is to be supreme, that its standards are to be lifted and that it is to be made more accountable if you will not even allow amendments in the parliament to be moved?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have the other example of the gag and the guillotine being moved on the social security bill—another terribly important piece of legislation. This also happened with the establishment of committees of this parliament. The government wanted to ram through a proposition which effectively said that the committees of this parliament could function through a quorum, through effective representation, with not one member of the opposition present.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        How can you really assert that the parliament is being given a role, is being listened to and is being made more accountable if you want to deny the opportunity for the opposition to participate? Why not be open about it? Do not hide behind this notion that you are lifting standards in this place. Do not hide
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         behind the notion that you are improving the running of the place. Just be open and honest and say, `We are going to use our numbers. We are going to close debates. We are going to restrict committee considerations. We are going to cut the resources to them so they can't do too much investigative work, and we will do it all as a cabinet.' It makes a mockery of the notion that you want the parliament to be supreme and the executive answerable to it. This is the most centralised, dictatorial government that this parliament has had in 13 years. They pretend that what they are doing is opening the place up.

        Another piece of legislation that was gagged and guillotined was the workplace industrial relations bill. This is the bill—despite the promises that no worker will be worse off—that is going to see living standards cut, women workers more disadvantaged, young workers paid less, unions attacked and award conditions eroded; yet you closed off the ability for the opposition to move amendments to that piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We had 335 amendments to that bill. People might think that that is an extraordinary number until they hear that the government, because it botched the first bill, had 61 amendments itself. So, in total, we are looking at 400 amendments. How much time did the government allow for 400 amendments to be considered by this parliament? Two hours. If you divide that up, you are talking about something like 15 seconds an amendment. What a joke in terms of the parliament being able to consider these issues. They want to laugh about it over there. They want to make out that this is not an important piece of legislation.

        Another area that they closed and gagged the debate on was the export market development grants scheme. This is a grant that enables companies to actually get out and export their produce to the rest of the world.

         The exports would not have occurred but for these grants to those companies. The grants have a multiplier effect of something like five to 10 times. For every dollar spent, $5 to $10 extra is generated in exports.

        Now we have the final piece of legislation—the ATSIC bill. This is the seventh piece of guillotined legislation in the parliament. Let's just understand the way this issue came before the parliament last night so that we can indicate why we are raising our concern at this opportunity today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Leader of the House came to me last night at about 20 minutes past 6 and said, `We are going to bring on the ATSIC legislation. The shadow minister is aware of it. We will let debate run on until 10.30 p.m.' There are three things that he failed to tell me. First of all, he failed to tell me that he was bringing in a new bill. It was not the one returning from the Senate but a new bill which required leave of the parliament, and they did not even seek to get agreement with us on that point. The second issue is that the member for Banks had not been notified. He knew nothing about the legislation coming on in the parliament at 6.30 p.m. and knew nothing about the fact that the government was bringing back a new bill. The third piece of trickery that the Leader of the House engaged in was that in moving the procedures he introduced a guillotine.

         —I am pleased to enter this adjournment debate. The matter I would like to talk about is, in regard to the Olympic Games, the effect the downgrading of Concord Hospital will have on the international reputation of Australia. The actions of the Carr Labor government have resulted in the downgrading of Concord Hospital—a hospital that is recognised in Australia now as the Olympics hospital. Once the Olympic Games in Atlanta are over, the international spotlight will be on Sydney. Visitors to Sydney and the teams that will be visiting Sydney in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the Olympic Games will come to Australia to inspect the medical and health facilities in the area. They will find that the Carr Labor government has downgraded the hospital and removed the general manager of that hospital. It is one of the finest teaching hospitals in Australia. The hospital has found itself having to put staff off.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a very serious matter, because this hospital's reputation is in the highest possible league. In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the Olympic Games there will be vast numbers of Olympic athletes visiting and testing the facilities. They will be making sure that what we have in Australia is good enough to ensure that we retain our reputation as a great sporting nation and that we can also provide for the health care and medical needs of visitors to Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        And what will they find when they come here? They will find a hospital that has some of the finest facilities in Australia to care for athletes. In fact, it has one of the best medical centres in the world for athletes, but that looks like being downgraded. It is interesting that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, with his treasurer, travelled all around the world posturing and saying, `Come to Sydney. We have the best of everything.' But as soon as they came back they downgraded one of the best teaching hospitals in Australia. The local community, of course, is extremely angry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Only a few days ago, the matter was raised in this parliament by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa
        <break page="3175" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         (Mr Bruce Scott). He quite rightly pointed out that this hospital was handed over to the state with certain provisos. Part of the agreement was that, before any beds were closed, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the veteran community would be consulted. In fact, they did nothing of the sort, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has already pointed out. I note that the minister is in the chamber for this adjournment debate. He has acknowledged the disgraceful situation that has occurred.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am very concerned about the welfare of the people in my community. The hospital has been doing the right thing by the community. It is one of the best hospitals, with a bed occupancy rate in excess of 85 per cent. In fact, last year the bed occupancy rate was 87&amp;half; per cent. These tremendous facilities that have been made available by the federal government to the state are now being downgraded. I think what has been foisted on the people of the inner west and on the nation of Australia is shameful of the Carr Labor government and his health minister. This hospital is far too important a hospital to be treated in the way it has. Now, of course, it has reached a situation where it is known internationally as the Olympics hospital, although it has been downgraded. That is a shame for Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I urge the Premier of New South Wales and the New South Wales health minister to reconsider their actions. I ask them to ensure that the health care needs of the people of the inner west are maintained—indeed, the health care needs of all people in Australia should be maintained—and that our international reputation is not in any way denigrated.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Four Corners
         </emphasis>
         program this week would have seen visual evidence of the way in which an American political organisation, an extreme right&amp;hyphen;wing organisation, has sent their agents into Australia, travelling as tourists, for the purpose of establishing a network within Australia. That network, having been established, has proceeded to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          apply pressure to individual families in rural communities, particularly those who were feeling the effects of the recession. The organisation has split families. But, more importantly for my electorate, it has engaged in an exercise of smearing community and business leaders who have one common factor between them, and that is that they are all members of Melbourne's Jewish community.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I view this seriously, as do the members of my electorate—Jewish and non&amp;hyphen;Jewish. We have seen the effects of anti-Semitism and what it led to in Nazi Germany. It is bad enough that we have our own local home&amp;hyphen;grown anti&amp;hyphen;Semites, but I for one am not going to tolerate—and I do not believe any member of this parliament should tolerate—a situation where non&amp;hyphen;Australian citizens come into our community, not using proper passport entries, describing themselves as tourists. What for? To give instructions to those who are members of a front organisation called the Citizens Electoral Council on how to go about perpetrating their propaganda in respect of a collapse of world banks and to say that the man who will solve all those problems for us is one Lyndon LaRouche.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some of the claims made by this organisation border on fantasy. I am not a monarchist but I believe it is a bit over the top for these people to come into Australia and say that Her Majesty the Queen is the head of an international drug cartel. I am not prepared to tolerate this situation in which distinguished leaders in the Jewish community find themselves. There is no excuse for it and, unfortunately, the organisation enlisted the support of a former member of this House, the former member for Deakin, Mr Aldred, who proceeded to purvey this rubbish in this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a serious matter when these people take it upon themselves to say that they will not merely investigate businessmen, prominent businessmen, who happen to be Jews; they will investigate their wives and their families. And as part of their tactic of discrediting them they spread the vile allegation that one of them is an international purveyor of drugs and pornography. What do you think happens to a child of a person who has to face that sort of allegation? Are we as a
        <break page="3176" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         community and as a parliament prepared to sit back and say, `Oh well. They are all a bit mad; they are all a bit off'?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that this is highly organised. They have trained people to sit on telephones and extract money from people in the Australian community by ringing them up, engaging them in conversation and pointing out the catastrophe, asking, `Do you agree with that? Can you make a donation?' It is interesting that when Mr Lyndon LaRouche went to gaol it was not for political harassment or treason; it was for debt card fraud. And at the bottom of their instructions sheet is `Get the number of the debt card'. This matter goes beyond the concerns of my own party. It is of deep concern to me because there is a large Jewish community in my electorate. This organisation makes no apology for the fact that the reason it transferred its headquarters in Melbourne was so that it could target that Jewish community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I felt so concerned about it that, in early February, a former parliamentary colleague, Mr Peter Cleeland, and I held a joint press conference because we had documented evidence from within that organisation, sworn affidavits as to the nature of their totally un&amp;hyphen;Australian political activity. It was at the beginning of the election campaign. I sent copies of that material to the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, the then Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, and the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. I asked for an independent judicial inquiry because I believe that this sort of activity has to be brought to the light of day and these people who are engaged on a permanent basis in libel, slander and in demeaning honest and decent Australian citizens have to be brought to book and the way to do that is through a properly constructed inquiry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I received a response from the then Prime Minister's office saying that yes, if we were re&amp;hyphen;elected, they would do that. I received a letter from the Leader of the National Party saying that he shared my concerns and he would raise it with the then Leader of the Opposition. I am still waiting to receive an answer from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I did not press him on that until the earlier
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         part of this month because, having become Prime Minister, he would be confronted with a whole range of pressures and problems and this would merely be one of them. Yesterday, by way of response to me when I raised this matter in another vein and in another way, he indicated that he had received that correspondence. He indicated that he had counselled the then member for Deakin against pursuing some of these allegations in this parliament. I have no doubt at all that he did that.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I wonder what the Prime Minister would have done if he had known that Mr Aldred was not acting alone in this matter; but it is on the record—and it is all in detail for any member who wants to read it in a publication that has just been made available—that this was not work done by Mr Aldred alone. He sat down with a group of LaRouche operatives and he had already indicated, for whatever personal motives he had, that he was out to get the leaders.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This material was produced, confected, in conjunction with people who are not Australian citizens and who have come here for this disgusting political purpose. They produced documents which were tabled in this House and referred to the Federal Police. The Federal Police came back and said that the documents were forgeries. If it had not been part of a political exercise in which the LaRouche movement was involved I would have expected the former honourable member for Deakin to withdraw and apologise. He did not. He considered that he had to continue to argue his position.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        More importantly, he refused to disclose the source of his documents. The source of his documents has now been made very public. It was made public by the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Four Corners

         Australian Israel Review
        </emphasis>
        which has detailed in depth material that they have obtained from former LaRouche operatives who have left this organisation but believe the full facts must be brought to the attention of the Australian people. This is not just a problem for one community; it is a problem for every member in this House and particularly, I would say, for some in rural areas because many of the
        <break page="3177" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

Contrary to some expressed views, I do understand the issues. I am attempting to balance up the arguments. I am not biased or arrogant on the issues raised. I am certainly not a traitor, as some of the more outlandish fringe dwellers suggest. However, I can assure the House that I will be holding the Commonwealth's line. My backbone will remain stiff.

        However, these resolutions are all about the taking of decisions in the broadest national interest by a Prime Minister who is exercising an overdue dose of national leadership. It is true that much of what has happened since 28 April has been generated by emotion. Why should any of us deny that and be in any way embarrassed by the emotional outcomes? The events at Port Arthur demanded nothing less at government levels than what is proposed.

        The Prime Minister did what the nation expected of him. He provided a public policy umbrella of persuasion under which the states and territories could develop legislative packages to formalise firearm ownership where there is a genuine reason, when there is a genuine need and where the usage of military and semiautomatic firearms is curtailed. As the President of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons said recently:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Each year over 500 Australians die from gunshot wounds, not to mention at least an equal number who are injured. It is no coincidence that the rates of deaths from shootings in the United Kingdom, where it is more difficult to get guns, is a third that of Australia's, while in the United States where it is easier to get guns the death rate is three times that of Australia. Too often, the devastating wounds caused by bullets have taken the lives of young people cut off in their prime. The gun lobby may call the federal and state governments' action following the tragedy at Port Arthur a "knee-jerk reaction" but if this so-called knee jerk reaction saves one life it will have been worth while.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of these 500&amp;hyphen;plus firearm deaths each year, the vast majority is not the result of criminal activity, which the pro&amp;hyphen;gun lobby seems to push, but involves suicide and the ultimate domestic violence—something which was reaffirmed earlier today in the AMA sponsored conference here in Parliament House. Calls for firearm ownership for personal protection against the home invader are therefore weak as is the persistent criticism
        <break page="3178" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that Australian citizens are losing a constitutional right. How can they lose a right that they do not enjoy at present? Arguments supporting such views and using such ammunition as a 1688 British bill or the Magna Carta have no basis.

        However, they are reflective of that small dedicated group—and that group is reflected in what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had to say earlier—which attempts to hijack the reforms. Theirs is an agenda of conspiratorial paranoia, of confrontation with the authority of the state, of extremism and of bigotry, of unjustified public anger; in some cases, it is a veneer of self&amp;hyphen;righteous religious zealotry in which biblical quotation justifies their actions. This nation must not move down that trail towards the violent outcomes of Waco and Oklahoma City. We need to speak up against the ravings of these people as they set out to infiltrate the more responsible ranks of some of the shooters' associations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People need to be reminded that firearm reform in itself is not the total answer. We need to be reminded that the Prime Minister has initiated urgent action at cabinet level regarding the impact of violent videos and the way people act, together with the need for changes in the area of mental health and a reduction in domestic violence. Put these additional initiatives with his move towards a restoration of some of the family values that have been lost in the last couple of decades and you have an overall national strategy. I therefore put it to the House that what is being proposed in terms of firearm reforms is a step very much in the right direction. In particular, I have every confidence that the Queensland legislation, when it is introduced into the state parliament early next month, will pass the test of reasonableness.

        Ordinary Australians, on and off farms, collectors, club shooters, feral animal cullers and all who have a genuine need, have nothing to fear from the proposals.

All members of the House should go and examine that document when they want to consider the question of labour market programs and the intensive campaign around Australia at the moment aimed at ensuring the future viability of skillshare centres. In that document you will find the statement: `Labour market programs will not be cut.'

        I think we all understand that over the last decade Australia has gone through a most dramatic period of change. Everyone argued for it. There was to be reform in the waterfront industry, reform on the railways, reform in manufacturing industry, reform in the financial sector—and I know the pressure that that is now creating, for example, for National Party members in rural Australia, as banks are closing on a regular basis and jobs are being lost. That is having a dramatic impact on those local communities.

        But we all made the decision, in facing up to those changes, that we were required as a community to invest in our future. One of the primary areas in which we decided to invest was in the future wellbeing of all Australians. We decided to ensure that we would do everything possible to try to get people back to work; that we would go out of our way to take out of Canberra ample resources to ensure that we created—in association with local communities, representatives of churches, unions, sporting clubs, country women's

        Unfortunately, I believe that the new government has abandoned that commitment and all of a sudden been consumed with a budget fetish. But that is not just my view. It is also, for example, the view of Dr Chris Caton, the respected Chief Economist of Bankers Trust Australia, who said in the

        I suggest that the great majority of Australians stand with the views of Dr Caton.

        In that vein I think the House has to understand that Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, is just plain wrong.

For example, in Sydney yesterday, at Petersham, over 400 people attended such a meeting and there will be further meetings next week in north&amp;hyphen;west Tasmania, in Box Hill in Dr Wooldridge's electorate and in a range of other electorates around the nation.

        I think it is time for the Prime Minister, as he did in 1981, to take hold of this issue and, basically, have a talk to his minister, Senator Vanstone, on the basis that there are some matters above the budget cutting process. The matter I suggest that ought to be above the budget cutting process is the skillshare program. I will tell you why.

        Skillshare is the most successful labour market program in Australia. Its success rate at a national level is over 60 per cent. But the success rate is not just in the form of statistics. It is, more importantly, reflected in the nature of the person who has had the opportunity to undertake training and gain employment as a result of that skillshare program. It is about the pride they now have in themselves, their families and their local communities. It is about the willingness of the employers to actually give them a second chance in life because they were prepared to invest in their own futures, to undertake a skillshare training program, to face up to their responsibilities and to again get job ready.

          —Yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), whose presence I note in the chamber at this moment, raised with me a very serious issue. We have considered very carefully the remarks he has made and I want to make a statement to the House.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised the question of actions by a former member in connection with allegations against a Mr Mark Leibler. This matter has been before the House before. As I understand it, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised a complaint on 25 September 1995 after the House was informed that the Australian Federal Police had concluded that certain documents used in connection with the allegations were forgeries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On 27 September 1995 my predecessor, Speaker Martin, responded to the first complaint. Speaker Martin quoted from an earlier Committee of Privileges report on the question of the alleged misuse of privilege by members. He suggested to members that they accept the responsibility that comes with the privilege of the House and he commended the reference in the draft code of conduct for members, with which he had been associated, to the need for members to have due regard to the rights and responsibilities of all Australian citizens. Speaker Martin concluded that no evidence had been presented to support a conclusion that a prima facie case of contempt had been made out and so he declined to allow precedence to a motion on the matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In raising this matter again yesterday, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to additional information presented in a recent

         program and in the current issue of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia Israel Review
         </emphasis>
         . As I understand it, this additional information deals with the provision of information to the member who had made the allegations and to contacts between that member and other persons and organisations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The substance of the complaint now made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is whether there was a conspiracy to use

          the forms and processes of the House in a way in which, as he put it, they were never meant to be used. A second aspect was the protection of citizens from what the honourable member described as `smears' when the citizens cannot resort to the normal legal protections.

         I have considered the comments of the honourable member and the additional information he provided to my office.

We are all judged by our peers and by the community according to our  actions and standards in these matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My understanding is that when a member uses the privileges of this place to make allegations and it later emerges that the member was in error, the member would be considered to have a duty to withdraw and apologise. The House may consider that it is a matter of regret that this course was not followed in the present case. Historically, the House has left it to members to make their own judgments about the use of privilege, but I must say that the standing of the House does suffer when abuse occurs.

         I note that yesterday, when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised this matter, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) intervened, indicating that there had been what he described as a `fairly vigorous exchange' on the matter between himself and the member making the allegations, Mr Aldred. The Prime Minister indicated that he had received correspondence from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the issues.

        Today I would like to draw to the attention of the House two families in my electorate. Let me say at the outset that these people have been somewhat reluctant to come forward with their story. They have been seeking no publicity—so I will not be naming them today—merely justice.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 13 August 1989, many members will remember there was an accident involving
        <break page="3182" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         two hot&amp;hyphen;air balloons at Alice Springs. Thirteen people died when one of the balloons descended onto the other, puncturing it and sending it into a fatal 600 metre free fall. The families of two that perished in that shocking accident live in my electorate of Sturt. Their fight for justice has been long and, seven years down the track, totally unsuccessful.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My constituents issued proceedings against a company called Farbix, which operated both balloons, against the estate of the deceased pilot and against the pilot who was found by the subsequent inquest into the accident to have been grossly negligent in allowing his balloon to descend upon the other. The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory granted interlocutory judgments against all three.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If this had been a motor vehicle accident, the compensation procedures would have been straightforward. The operating company and the drivers would have been covered by third party personal insurance and the compensation would have been paid on the determination of fault. Sadly, in 1989, the same straightforward and logical approach did not apply to aviation laws. The aggrieved relatives are naturally seeking compensation and their claims have been assessed by the legal firm that represents them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There have been major problems in the discovery process. Was Farbix insured? All attempts to find the answer to that question have been fruitless. Arthur Andersen and Co., who placed Farbix into liquidation, did an extensive search of all company documents and could not find an insurance policy. Insurance company insiders believe that only one company was underwriting balloons at the time of the accident. However, the Civil Aviation Authority could not positively identify the insurer because regulations did not mandate that insurance details be registered with the authority.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Still, the legal firm that represented my constituents believes that Farbix was insured. At the time of the inquest, a Mr R.J. Davies of Australasian Aviation Claims in North Sydney—and I note the presence of the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)—identified himself to the lawyers as represent ing the underwriters. He would not, and still refuses to, identify the underwriter he claimed to represent.

We often hear stories about people attempting to defraud insurance companies with bogus claims. We hear also about insurance companies' failure to admit liability, leaving aggrieved policy&amp;hyphen; holders in the lurch. Two wrongs do not make a right and there is no excuse for the hostility on the part of either the insurer or the insured toward each other.

        In this situation there is no doubt as to the veracity of the claim. But as no-one can seem to identify the insurer, the insurer obviously feels little responsibility to play fair. Rather, the insurer is shrouded in anonymity. Theirs is an attitude of `if no&amp;hyphen;one gets caught, then no harm has been done'.

        Indeed, everyone in this case seems so far to have escaped blame. The pilot at fault had a verdict of manslaughter set aside after attempting to flee to South Africa. The pilot who was not at fault died in the crash and his estate has no value. Farbix, naturally, is bankrupt.

        I have been informed that the cost of discovering the identity of the insurer may exceed $100,000, which obviously leaves my constituents in a bind. To get all the answers will involve my constituents appointing a liquidator so that action may be taken against the insurer—if there is one. They would then be obligated to indemnify the liquidator in a claim against the insurer to enforce payment under the policy. The process will be long and draining, both financially and emotionally. In the end, of course, they may not win.

         The federal government acted last year to ensure that all carriers of air passengers were sufficiently insured. The Monarch Airlines crash earlier this decade raised the spectre of insurance companies avoiding compensation pay-outs if the insurer believed the operator had failed to meet safety standards. This is one of the problems for my constituents. If the insurer is found, they may avoid liability if they successfully prove that Farbix failed to disclose or acted in a negligent fashion or breached aviation regulations.

         From 20 January this year, that loophole has been no longer available to insurance companies. All carriers of fare&amp;hyphen;paying passengers now need a certificate from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

The requirement on carriers is that they now carry at least $&amp;half; million insurance per passenger before such a certificate is issued.

        I also add that they play upon the fears of people in rural areas who are under enormous financial pressure. I struck the same thing when I was involved in the trade union movement. The Trotskyites in the movement used to descend on members of the labour force in areas where they were under pressure. I remember what happened in Kambalda where 600 people got retrenched on one day. Within a few days the Trots were there trying to capitalise on the fear that existed in the community.

Like the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), I agree that the preamble we signed was not the preamble that appeared in the paper. When I signed that petition I was aware it had no consequences for Australian holders. LaRouche was convicted and sentenced to 15 years gaol. He was out in less than three. I thought if the man wants a retrial he might go back to gaol—what happened in America was fine. But I have  been a consistent critic of that organisation and its methods of operation. I might add that the only people out in the bush who have been putting the counterview and fighting this element have been the League of Rights—not the National Party or the Jewish community in Melbourne.

        I want to talk about the Family Law Court in particular. I know a woman in Western Australia who has been enormously disadvantaged by it. Her husband left her. All the assets of the marriage were her assets. She proposed an amicable split of 50-50, which was very generous. The husband, in fact, at first expressed concern—he said it was too generous. But very soon he succumbed and she fund herself in endless litigation. She was subjected to bullying tactics from a lawyer—a lawyer who, in my estimation, probably made $300,000 out of this—and harassment and bullying by a judge of the Family Law Court who behaved in an absolutely reprehensible way. This was a woman who was on two occasions bashed up in car parks as a result of the trouble she was having.

I think the judge's behaviour is certainly inexplicable and is driven either by some notion of male chauvinist superiority or by guilt. In my view, it is guilt driven. This is an outrage. I have mentioned it here in the hope that it will be mentioned in the media in Western Australia where perhaps we can get some justice, which is clearly not available from the court system.

         The other issue I want to talk about is what has happened to rural Australia. I have before me letters from people in Lightning Ridge, which I think is in the electorate of the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). I do not know why they should write to me because it is 10 years since I have been in Lightning Ridge. Every business in Lightning Ridge would have written to me expressing their concern about actions affecting the rural sector. In particular, they make mention of the diesel fuel rebate, which has had a profound influence on Lightning Ridge. It is not just the diesel fuel rebate which will act disproportionately on country people; there are other aspects too.

         The Department of Health and Family Services in Western Australia, faced with budget cuts, has decided simply to axe every one of its regional offices. They are going to concentrate on working from Perth. The truth is that until they moved to regional areas there was no service to country people. That will now be withdrawn. To suggest that they can be serviced adequately from the capital city is bizarre nonsense. I asked about this by way of a question without notice and was refused an answer by the Speaker for reasons which certainly escape me. It is a simple fact: the department is looking at closing every regional office.

People have gone through the education system and it has failed them.

        —by leave—The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) deserves to be congratulated in this instance because he has not filibustered or stalled. He has had the matter of this general direction drawn to his attention. There were problems with the earlier general direction and, by giving this present general direction, he has ensured that no funding to indigenous organisations would be delayed over the next three months by virtue of the special auditor mechanism.

       I have reservations about these general directions, by the way. I do not blame the minister for this. I blame the cabinet. The cabinet acted on the run and, in my opinion, acted without considered advice in relation to imposing on the minister this requirement to issue these special directions for a special auditor—a special auditor that is going to cost the ATSIC organisation $750,000 for six months work. That is $750,000 that could have been delivered to providing community services to organisations.

         —Today I stand to bring to the House's attention a topic of grave concern to the many men and women of this great country. The topic is the current child support system. At present people who, for one reason or another, have had the misfortune of a relationship break&amp;hyphen;up and who have children from that relationship are being torn apart by a child support system that not only leaves the non-custodial parent in a position of extreme poverty but also forces them to leave their jobs, as many cannot afford to make the payments that the system requires them to pay. Further, there
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          are domestic disputes that arise from the fact that so much has to be paid.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The current system is a draconian system and it does nothing for the people of this country. If you wish to get access to your children, some may say, `Well, if you can't get access, go to court.' This is a facade. Once the child support system gets stuck into you, you are sadly mistaken if you think of a court as a course of action. The majority of people cannot afford the legal action that they would have to take to see their children.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many cases and I mention, in particular, those in the area of Capricornia, where people are on incomes of between $70,000 and $90,000 a year. These people are forced to make child support payments of up to $550 a week, and some have only two children. This leaves nothing in the pay packet for the mortgage on the house, car payments, purchases of clothes, food or even a respectable standard of living. I have discussed the current child support system with many men and women, not only in my electorate of Capricornia but throughout the best part of Queensland. I have a submission of the list of changes that many people would like to see. The current system is a draconian system and is not workable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first change that the majority of the people I have spoken to would like to see is that payments be calculated on the net income, not the gross income, of the non-custodial parent. This puts both parties on a level playing field, because tax should be shared evenly between the family even though they may not be living together.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another suggested change is that child support payments should be calculated on a weekly basis, as is the current PAYE tax system, not 12 monthly or at a review. In current times, people's jobs are being restructured and their pay rates fluctuate. People have been told they have to make a certain payment every week and, because their wages fluctuate, they often end up paying more than they earn. So all of a sudden they find themselves in arrears. This is not a fair system, and it needs to be looked at ASAP.
       </para>
       <break page="3188" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another proposed change is that the custodial parent, the receiver of the payments, document expenditure of the moneys received and that a trust fund be opened so that all moneys not spent can be retained for the child's future and not spent on things other than those which are required for the child.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The next proposed change is that the second family of the non-custodial parent be taken into account in an effort to reduce child support payments so that the new family unit has sufficient moneys on which to live. Currently, we have a system where men and women who have gone into second relationships and who are paying child support cannot afford to maintain their new relationship with their new family.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The next proposed change is that the Child Support Agency continue to take refund cheques. The custodial parents were very happy with this, because if the non-custodial parent refused to pay, at the end of the financial year the tax refunds, which were maintained by the Taxation Office, would be given to the custodial parent. That is still considered to be fair and should remain. Where the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent has not been making payments and the money is being kept, the Child Support Agency keeps all the penalties. That is a draconian system and should not work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One last proposed change—this is a system that many people would like to see happen—is that the child support payments be a discrete amount calculated on a child's age rather than the current system that calculates as a percentage of the non-custodial parent's income. This means that, if you have children between the ages of one and five, you would pay a set amount of, say, $20 or $30. If the child was between the ages of five and eight and going to school, you may have to pay $30 or $40. As the child's age increases, so should the amount of money.

       </para>
       <para>
        This claim is false. The member for Bennelong's claim is based on a poor authority, given that Graham Richardson was not involved in the cabinet debate on the issue of how to deal with the matter of Aussat's debt stream. Therefore, it might be generously said of him that he was unfortunately wrong but not necessarily malicious in his wrongness.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second unstated source for the member for Bennelong's continuing assertions that Paul Keating wanted to sell off Telecom, as it was known in 1990, was an interview Paul Keating did with Kerry O'Brien on
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Lateline
        </emphasis>
        . Paul Keating's comments have continually been used out of context by the member for Bennelong and others on that side of the House to misrepresent his real position on the ownership of Telecom. Paul Keating said at the time that the essence of the debate was not the question of ownership per se but a question of competition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Paul Keating supported the full public ownership of Telecom, and he stressed in that interview with Kerry O'Brien that the current question did not relate to ownership, as full public ownership was a given, but as to how the government dealt with introducing competition into the marketplace. The core reality is that the Australian Labor Party prior to 1990, in 1990 and through to 1996 has consistently, openly, directly and forcefully declared its total opposition to the sale of Telecom or, as it is now known, Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Paul Keating, in his roles as Treasurer and Prime Minister, consistently supported and argued for full public ownership of Telecom. The former Prime Minister and member for Blaxland debated in the cabinet the question of how the federal Labor government should best deal with the budgetary problems arising from the indebtedness of the Australian satellite, which was foisted on the Australian people by the Fraser government against
        <break page="3189" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         advice from Telecom that optical fibre cabling of the nation was a better and more cost-effective alternative.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Fraser government gave us Aussat as a present from Mr Packer, and the present Howard coalition is set, should it succeed in selling off one-third of Telstra, to give the media moguls another big present—courtesy of the coalition. Those who own the backbone of Australia's communications system own the future. Labor believes that the Australian people should fully own Telstra, the very backbone of the communications system, and should benefit from its future income stream. The coalition would fully sell off Telstra to private interests who would become the communications system's future eaters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The disingenuous nature of the member for Bennelong's misrepresentation of the former Prime Minister's position on the sale of Telstra has a long history. On 19 September 1990, the member for Bennelong supported Paul Keating's option on the merging of OTC and Aussat as the most sensible option facing the then Labor government. But he disingenuously argued that the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, did not want Telecom to be publicly owned forever. He was dead wrong then and he is dead wrong now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He seems to have understood the arguments then, but he does not today seem to recall that he fully put the coalition's real agenda in 1990. The member for Bennelong is quoted in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard

        on 19 September 1990 as saying:

        . . . the policy espoused by the Opposition which is the only truly economical and rational policy—that is to have full, unfettered competition and to privatise Telecom after the establishment of the competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current Prime Minister believed in 1990 that this was the ideal set down by the coalition. On 27 June 1996, the current Prime Minister still believes that that is the ideal—it is, in fact, the Howard government's policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Howard government is seeking to sell one-third of Telstra in this parliamentary term. During the 1996 March general election campaign, the coalition put the proposition that it would sell off one-third in the first term and that, depending on circumstances, it
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         would put the proposition to the Australian people at the next election to sell off the rest.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Howard coalition government is being utterly consistent in relation to this matter. They do not believe in the full public ownership of Telstra—they want to sell the whole thing off. They are determined to destroy Telstra, something that the Australian people own in full and cherish. They want to flog it off in one to three tranches to their media mogul mates. Ideologically, they want to smash the very notion of public ownership of Telstra and other federal government utilities. This is the revenge of the Visigoths—those who would rape and pillage, those who would destroy rather than nurture and create.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The dividing line between the coalition and the federal parliamentary Labor Party on the public ownership of Telstra is sharp and the contrast between our positions is stark. The ALP is fully committed to the Commonwealth government retaining full ownership of Telstra. The ALP understands that by the year 2030, 35 per cent of Australia's gross national product will come from communications. An efficient, competitive and publicly owned Telstra can ensure that the federal government and the Australian people directly benefit from the massive and exponential growth of the communications sector of the economy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ALP believes in a strong, central government for the Commonwealth of Australia and in the full ownership of Telstra. This ideological Howard coalition government would strip the federal government of its powers, hand back whatever functions it can to the states and sell off the rest to private interests. The coalition does not believe in a strong, central federal government. It hankers for a return to the Australia of 1901, when the federal government had control of only defence, customs and excise, and posts and telegraphs. They would keep the first two legs of the tripod of powers but flog off communications to foreign and domestic private interests.

        Of particular concern at the present time is the RACAC process in New South Wales. That process is part of the national forest policy. The federal government has put certain criteria on that policy to try to maintain adequate and representative reserves of forests across the state and, indeed, across Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The process goes back to an international convention which I believe was approved at a meeting at Colombo. The nations meeting observed that it would be a good idea for nations to protect about 10 per cent of their current forests. The previous Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, decided in his wisdom that in Australia that criterion should be set  at 15 per cent of forests, to bring it into line with the situation in 1750. Even though there is no documented evidence of the extent of the forest reserve at that time, it is believed by many people, and it can be seen by reading the diaries of the explorers, that the Aboriginals' burning of forests had a considerable influence on the extent of forests that existed when Europeans first came to this country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        While the national forest policy certainly talks about adequate and representative reserves and has certain criteria set by the federal government, the Carr government has put in place its own wilderness definition, which is broader than the definition of the Commonwealth. It has put in place a definition of `old growth', which is an area where no stump can be found. Anyone with any forestry experience would know that it would be difficult to find a stump in a forest 50 or 60 years in the regrowth process. Older people in the community are telling us of the ludicrous situation in which some former farming lands which have regrown trees over a period of 40 or 50 years are now being declared old growth forest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This definition is being manipulated by the Carr government because they are absolutely paranoid about trying to pander to the extreme greens. They have gone to the extent of putting in criteria which talk about irreplaceable forest and have fauna habitat protection laws. In the experience that we have had, they will extend these criteria even further.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to inform the House of the very devious extent that they have gone to. The former federal government believed that the coast of New South Wales should be divided into two areas—the north coast and the mid-north coast—in the assessment of these reserves. It is fairly clear that the New South Wales government has gone to the further extent of dividing it into 11 separate areas and has ignored what is outside the individual area. By doing that, they have been able to expand the 15 per cent to 23 per cent and, in some instances, 30 per cent. Of course, this has the potential to have extraordinary repercussions on country communities.

        In fact, in areas such as Dorrigo, 80 per cent of the forest resource is locked up; in the Urbenville forest management area, 90 per cent; and in the area of Hunter, 100 per cent. Of course, the New South Wales government is deliberately not releasing a socioeconomic report which shows the devastating effects on small country communities, where towns of 200 to 300 people will be completely closed down because these forests are being denied. It is important to bring some facts to this debate because it can be very confusing. The renewal of licences is also an issue in the woodchip debate.

        I want to draw to the attention of the House that only one per cent of forests are harvested at any one time in Australia. It is not cleared; it is regrown. In fact, if you look at forestry across Australia, you will find that somewhere between two and three trees are being grown for every tree that has been harvested. Yet we have this dishonest debate fuelled by the greens who are determined to tell lies.

         There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very serious issue. I want to make it very clear that the Carr government are being very dishonest in this debate. They are trying to imply that they are using federal criteria in this resource and conservation assessment process. I make it very clear that they are not federal criteria; they are New South Wales government criteria. Even the unions them selves, which have been supporters of the Carr government, are now saying that they have been let down. In fact, they have been misled. They have been misled by this government because the government told the unions, when they were seeking their support in the New South Wales election, that they would be protecting the jobs of their members. Now the unions can see that they have been absolutely misled and sold out by this process.

        The New South Wales government said that they would give compensation to workers and companies that were affected by this process. Obviously, when they go to this extent, the amount of money that is available from the Commonwealth and state is not adequate to give compensation to people and to companies.

       In February, the then Prime Minister announced that the ATO had found that many high wealth individuals are engaging in tax avoidance such that the revenue lost is hundreds of millions of dollars. The revenue at risk from this avoidance is estimated to be around $800 million per year.

       The Government is committed to continued action against tax evasion and blatant tax avoidance and will be taking such steps as are necessary to ensure that high wealth individuals pay their fair share of tax.

       A joint ATO/Treasury team is examining the broad nature of tax minimisation techniques employed by those high wealth individuals who pay very little income tax and is developing appropriate policy responses to address tax practices used by these individuals to avoid tax. As part of this project, the ATO is conducting an on going investigation of the arrangements used by these individuals to avoid tax. ATO investigations have already revealed that a number of high wealth individuals use complex multiple trust structures to avoid tax.

       The Commissioner of Taxation has recently announced some details of the first stage of a comprehensive program to further the ATO's understanding of the tax practices used by high wealth individuals. It will involve extensive national enquiries, initially to be by letter, that will help the ATO to gain a full understanding of structures and strategies employed so that the most comprehensive administrative responses and legislative proposals can be designed.

Following receipt of necessary advice from the ATO/Treasury team, the government will decide what policy proposals to bring before the Parliament. As some of the avoidance techniques are potentially more readily addressed than others, progressive tabling of legislative responses may be required.

       Individual countries have not, and will not, be asked to participate in the Emergency Financing Mechanism (EFM). The EFM is not a facility in which countries could participate. It is a set of procedures within the existing facilities of the IMF. The creation of the EFM is within the powers of the IMF's Executive Board, which is responsible for conducting the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day business of the Fund. The Executive Board approved the EFM procedures on 12 September 1995.

       (b) Only in the case of syndication is there a two stage process which involves `approval' by the Industry Research and Development Board prior to registration. This first stage approval involves the Board's decisions on eligibility of the R&amp;D activities, core technology and finance schemes. Detailed records of approvals and rejections of syndicate applications are not available. However, the number of approved syndicates is higher than the registered syndicates. Approved syndicates need not proceed to registration, at the applicant's discretion.

       (2) The 1996-97 Budget Statements will include information on the underlying budget balance. The underlying budget balance estimates the Commonwealth budget sector's direct contribution to the national saving and investment imbalance as measured in the national accounts, which in turn represents the nation's current account deficit. The underlying budget balance is the headline balance less net advances, which comprise primarily equity assets sales and net repayments of debt by the States; more information on this concept is given in the recently released National Fiscal Outlook. Data on the underlying budget balance were included in the revised Budget estimates provided in my press release of 12 March 1996.

       (2) As at September 1994, there were 62 Voluntary Regional Organisations of Councils (VROCs) across all States, covering about 50 per cent of all councils and 75 per cent of the population in Australia. Since then all the Victorian VROCs have ceased operation, mainly due to the council amalgamation process in the interim. The 52 existing VROCs cover 54 per cent of all councils and 57 per cent of the population in Australia.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (a) I am advised that Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) proposes to expand the workforce at the proposed Jabiluka mine gradually, from 5&amp;hyphen;10 in the first year to a maximum of 110 in about the ninth year of operation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (b) The Jabiluka proposal currently before the Government is indeed a capital&amp;hyphen;intensive operation, as are most mining projects. Additional direct employment associated with the development of Jabiluka will involve a workforce of about 60 in the construction phase. The mine is also likely to contract Aboriginal corporations for environmental projects and other support services, as is currently the practice at Ranger, producing additional casual employment.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       It should also be noted that the ERA proposal does not involve Jabiluka as a stand alone project. ERA proposes an integrated Ranger—Jabiluka operation, with ore from both mines being milled at Ranger. About 150 people are employed in milling facilities and administrative areas at Ranger. The output from Jabiluka will make an increasingly important contribution to ERA's overall operations as the mine is developed and will therefore contribute to the maintenance of these jobs at Ranger.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       In addition, industry and academic sources estimate the multiplier effect of mining projects in Australia at 3&amp;hyphen;4. This means that the Jabiluka project could lead to indirect employment of 220&amp;hyphen;330. This, of course, does not take into account the ongoing indirect employment generated by the integrated operations at the Ranger milling facility.

       (2) No. Deeming is based on the principle of expecting people to get a reasonable return on their investments before turning to the community for support. Deeming encourages people to think about the returns their investments are generating. The deeming rates are set in the light of prevailing market rates of return on stable, low risk investments so that pensioners can achieve investment returns at the deeming rates without risking their capital.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) The level of fees and charges that people may incur in rearranging their portfolios to match the deeming rates are relatively low. The enhancement of existing at&amp;hyphen;call pensioner accounts will reduce the need for people to rearrange their investments. The majority of pensioner financial investments are held in deposits with financial institutions, and most pensioners who wished to change these deposits could do so without charge, except in some instances where they may incur State taxes on withdrawals. However, being able to earn a higher rate of interest will benefit pensioners overall. In any event, if investments are earning below 5 per cent, people may have good reason to retain them. For example, there may be tax advantages from the investment, or the investment may be a more volatile investment which is expected to
       <break page="3214" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        return much more than 5 per cent as an average over a number of years. Therefore, people should not only consider the Social Security implications of an investment.

       From 20 March 1995, war widows and war widowers became eligible for an income support allowance from DVA equivalent to the rate of Age or Invalid Pension they were entitled to receive from DSS. It was estimated that some 54,000 war widow pensioners formerly assisted by DSS would transfer to the DVA allowance and that in future years a further 5,500—6,000 war widow pensioners per year would remain with DVA when they reached Age Pension age.

The length of time between the death of former service pensioners and the announcement of the initiative made it difficult to identify customers who may have benefited from the scheme. DVA publicised the change and notified DSS only of those clients who requested a transfer. The measure was estimated to result in some 16,000 DSS customers transferring to DVA. It is not possible to estimate the number of customers who were not identified and remain on Age Pension.

       All sitting members of parliament were provided with a full roll (i.e. download) for their respective electorates following the close of rolls. No supplements (i.e. updates) have been issued since that supply for members in the ACT, NSW, Vic, Queensland, WA, Tas or the NT.

       The AEC has been working on a new system for the provision of electoral roll data on CD&amp;hyphen;ROM since before the election. This new system is nearing completion, and is expected to be released to all members within the next two weeks. Supply of data will recommence with the introduction of this new system.

       South Australian electoral rolls are managed on a separate computer system from the rest of the country. That system has not been changed to cater for CD&amp;hyphen;ROM based rolls, on the expectation that the South Australian electoral rolls will be migrated to the national roll management system in the near future. South Australian data will automatically be available on CD&amp;hyphen;ROM when that occurs. In the meantime, members for South Australian electorates will continue to receive data under the old system. Shipments containing full rolls and monthly supplements to 31 May 1996 were dispatched to South Australian members during the week ending 21 June 1996. Further supplements will be dispatched around the middle of each month, until migration to the national CD&amp;hyphen;ROM system occurs.
