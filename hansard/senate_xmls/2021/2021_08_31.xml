                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  There is scarcely an institution in Australia that has not been touched by an allegation of sexual harassment over the past few yearsâ€”the Defence Force, the High Court, hospital operating theatres, theatre productions, big banks, big miners and, of course, here in the Parliament of Australia. The fact that these stories are being openly reported and publicly discussed may be new, but the stories themselves are old. They are wearyingly old for the generations of women who have had to live them. Sexual harassment has been a standing feature of women's working lives. That is one of the inescapable conclusions of the landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report produced by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report itself is a sobering document. I have read it, and it is difficult to imagine making your way through it and not feeling compelled to act urgently to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces, yet, staggeringly, that is precisely what the Morrison government did. The Morrison government ignored the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report for over a year, leaving it to gather dust on the desk of former Attorney-General Mr Porter. During that year Mr Porter didn't even bother to meet with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to discuss it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took until April this year to respond to the report. Mr Morrison made a flashy announcement that he would adopt every recommendation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, but the truth is a lot more complex, because, if you read the fine printâ€”and you always need to with this governmentâ€”you see that the government agreed to all the recommendations except that for some that agreement was in principle or in part or they just noted the recommendation with no intention to do anything about it. It was months after that when the government prepared the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021, which we are now considering. Even this legislation has been brought on for debate a week late. As I'll go on to explain, the bill ignores the most important and urgent legislative changes and it botches most of the recommendations that the government has grudgingly agreed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From start to finish this government's actions tell a pretty simple story: unless the Prime Minister is being asked questions about this issue at a press conference, sexual harassment is not a political priority for the Morrison government. That is simply not good enough, because, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report makes clear, this is a serious problem that demands serious action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is a confronting document. It found that workplace sexual harassment is prevalent and pervasive. It occurs in every industry, in every location and at every level in Australian workplaces, and Australians across the country are suffering the financial, social, emotional, physical and psychological harm associated with sexual harassment. And of course this is particularly so for Australian women. This behaviour also represents a very real financial cost to the economy through lost productivity, staff turnover and other associated impacts, with workplace sexual harassment estimated to cost the Australian economy $3Â½ billion a year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry found that 40 per cent of women and 25 per cent of men have been sexually harassed at work in the past five years. The inquiry also found that most people who experience sexual harassment never report it, because they fear the impact that reporting it will have on their reputation and their career prospects. The answer to this is legislative change. The report makes that clear. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current legal and regulatory system is simply no longer fit for purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the current system for addressing workplace sexual harassment in Australia is complex and confusing for victims and employers to understand and navigate. It also places a heavy burden on individuals to make a complaint.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often there are consequences for employers only after sexual harassment has occurred and only if victims are brave enough to risk their careers by making a formal complaint. This can lead to employers discouraging victims from making complaintsâ€”instead of providing a safe working environment free from sexual harassment. The commissioner found that there is an 'urgency for change'. She said that a whole new approach to addressing sexual harassment in workplaces is needed. Well, this bill doesn't do that. This bill does not implement that urgent new approach. Instead, it nibbles around the edges of substantial reform, with most changes simply clarifying or confirming the way the law already operates. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report was clear: we cannot tackle sexual harassment without meaningful legislative reform. Unfortunately, the commissioner herself has described the government's response as a missed opportunity.</span>

Labor is committed to fully implementing all 55 recommendations of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's groundbreaking <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report to help keep Australians safe from sexual harassment at work. We will be moving a detailed series of amendments to remedy the worst of the government's oversights. If the government refuse to amend the shortcomings in their bill, then, under Anthony Albanese, a Labor government will work with the Workplace Sexual Harassment Council, employers, workers, unions and legal experts to finalise and implement stronger laws as a matter of priority.</span>

I visited the surviving Working Women's Centres and met with the amazing and hardworking people who staff them. They provide free, confidential assistance and advice about workplace matters, including sexual harassment, wage theft and discrimination. You would think that, having received and committed to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report's recommendations, the Morrison government would want to keep these centres open. You'd be wrong. In May this year I was at the Alice Springs office of the Northern Territory Working Women's Centre, which was under threat because of budget cuts by this government. A Labor government would act to keep the centre's doors open and establish new centres across the country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will have more to say about Labor's other amendments in the committee stage, but I want to outline at this stage in the debate the key issues we are seeking to remedy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of the new approach Kate Jenkins called for is recommendation 17, which calls for a positive duty on employers to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment in the workplaceâ€”not to fix it up later but to prevent it happening in the first place. This recommendation is designed to shift from the current reactive model that requires complaints from individualsâ€”brought on an ad hoc basis by those with the courage and means to do soâ€”to a proactive model that would require employers to take the initiative, to take responsibility, to create workplaces that are free from sexual harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite claiming that it has taken action to implement the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report, the government only notes this recommendation that is at the heart of the approach. And this bill does nothing to seek to implement it. Recommendation 18 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report calls for the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to be given the function of assessing compliance with the new positive duty and for enforcement, and these powers are important to make the new positive duty real and enforceable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there are many other recommendations that remain unimplemented in this billâ€”for example, recommendation 19, which was to give the commission a broad function to inquire into systemic unlawful discrimination, including systemic sexual harassment; recommendation 25, which calls for the introduction of a cost protection provision in the AHRC Act, mirroring the cost protection regime that is already in place in section 570 of the Fair Work Act; recommendation 23, to amend the AHRC Act to allow unions and other representative groups to bring representative claims to court, consistent with the existing provisions in that act that allow unions and other representative groups to bring a representative complaint to the commission; and recommendation 28, that the Fair Work system be reviewed to ensure and clarify that sexual harassmentâ€”using the definition in the Sex Discrimination Actâ€”is expressly prohibited. The government's response to recommendation 28 was only to agree in principle, and it's not actioned in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the reality is that there is only so much that can be done to fix a bill once it has been introduced. Labor will be moving amendments to introduce a positive duty on employers to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment from happening in the first place. We will seek to change the Fair Work Act to explicitly prohibit sexual harassment. We will seek to make substantive equality between women and men one of the objects of the Sex Discrimination Act. We will allow unions and other organisations to bring legal action against perpetrators on behalf of complainants, and we will seek to establish cost protections for complainants so they aren't discouraged from taking legal action against perpetrators due to the possibility of having to pay massive court ordered legal costs. I look forward to debating this during the committee stage. I look forward to hearing from the government why these matters are not considered a matter of urgency for themâ€”why these matters haven't been included in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Respect@Work inquiry was an important and landmark piece of work. It confirmed what Australian women already knew: the steady drumbeat of sexual harassment and assault cases reported in the media is simply the tip of the iceberg. The truth is that going public has been no guarantee of justice for women who have experienced completely unacceptable behaviour at work. It is also an option that is not available to the overwhelming majority of Australian women. Your boss or your workplace should not have to be high profile for you to receive justice and support. All women deserve a safe workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reveals that the Prime Minister didn't really mean it when he said that the government would implement all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. That was a hollow commitment. Labor will do what we can in this debate to remedy the gaps, but an Albanese Labor government will work with the Workplace Sexual Harassment Council, employers, workers, unions and legal experts to finalise and implement stronger laws as a matter of priority.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak, finally, on this bill to protect women in all workplaces and to attempt to deliver, following the report of Commissioner Jenkins, a safe workplace for women. But it takes a government like the Morrison-Joyce government to be 17 months late to the party and then to leave out the key point of the Jenkins review into keeping workplaces safe. This government has managed to belatedly put forward a bill that misses the key recommendation that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner put forward, which is a positive duty on employers to provide a safe workplace for their workersâ€”mainly women, who are the ones who are inevitably sexually harassed in so many workplaces. Here we are, with the Prime Minister once again really failing to grapple with and understand the predicament that so many women are in and once again treating women like a political problem to be managed, rather than actually listening to the advice, acting on it and providing a safe workplace for women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It feels like an election's in the offing, because the government have taken 17 months to get to this point and now they're hastily rushing through a bill that doesn't actually address all of the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report which was tabled in March last year, and they've provided no explanation for their failure to do that. But one look at the number of women in the government's ranks perhaps answers that question. This government has the opportunity to provide a safe workplace for workers across the country and, rather than do that and act on the advice of the Jenkins report, despite saying that it was going to, it's now put forward a bill that leaves that main point out. I'm genuinely baffled but perhaps not really surprised, if I'm honest, that, once again, the government has failed to deliver for women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we're sick of this. We are sick and tired of the government not understanding the predicament that women are in. From its botched response to the pandemic, which has been felt disproportionately by women, its belated and botched response now to women in all workplaces and its absolutely botched response to the issues of harassment in this very workplace of Parliament House, there's no other conclusion that can be drawn: this government just does not understand women and it actually doesn't really care that much about addressing the situation that we're in. That's the only conclusion that can be drawn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report was initially on the books of Minister Porter, where it went nowhere and gathered dust. We all know that Minister Porter has been accused of a historical rape, but he remains in cabinet, albeit with a different ministry. This bill is now under the auspices of a different minister, and we've finally seen a bill rolled out, but it leaves out the key point. There's nothing that typifies the Morrison government better than this bill: it's late and it misses the point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to talk about some of the features of this bill, the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021, which we will be supporting. There are some good bits in the bill that actually implement some of the recommendations of Commissioner Jenkins. But then I'll come to the amendments that the Greens will move to fix the bits that the government's forgotten about or deliberately left out because it doesn't want to offend people, perhaps. The bill includes sex based harassment as a separate offence, which is positive. It recognises that not all harassment based on gender is sexual in nature. Some of it's just misogyny. It finally makes politicians and judges subject to the Sex Discrimination Act. Why politicians and judges were exempt in the first place is just beyond me, and the past few years have highlighted just how absurd that absence has been. I hope that the inclusion of those roles will really herald a change in the culture of parliamentary officesâ€”and judicial offices, for that matter. We want women to aspire to those roles and to know that they will be safe and respected in those workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill extends the time in which complaints of discrimination and harassment can be made. That's a positive thing. It recognises that it takes an awful lot of guts and courage to raise these issues and that often it takes some time for a worker to make the decision to progress a complaint. They should have the time to do that. Sadly, it often takes the worker having moved on from that workplace to have the ability to make the complaint, because, inevitably, it's women that suffer the consequences and harassers, who are so often men, are the ones that often get to keep their jobs. Sometimes they even get promoted, particularly if they're in the Liberal Party. But that's why the extension of time within which complaints are to be taken is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also allows workers who are sexually harassed to apply for a stop harassment order from the Fair Work Commission. That's very positive. We support that. It removes the exemption that state government employees currently haveâ€”also much needed. It's much needed in particular because this was the only facet that had been excluded. All of the other antidiscrimination elements were able to be pursued federally or at the state level. This was the last one. I want to, at this stage, acknowledge Jac Woodhouse, who's been in contact with my office over several years. She's been a long-term advocate for making sure that state government employees can make a complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act, not just under state laws. Jac was driven by her own experience of being discriminated against and bullied from her job, and she fell between the cracks as a result of this exemption. I hope that she draws some comfort when this loophole is finally closed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill extends protections against sexual harassment to all paid and unpaid workers, including volunteers, interns and the self-employed. That's positive. Also, it provides five days of compassionate leave to workers affected by miscarriage. This is outside the scope of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> reforms, but it recognises that workers experiencing trauma should have access to paid leave. That's very welcome. The same rationale should be extended to survivors of family and domestic violence. The Greens have long campaigned for 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave to be available to workers. Indeed, amendments will be moved. The Greens have circulated amendments. I understand the Labor Party will also be circulating their amendments. This is a great opportunity to finally have paid family and domestic violence leave for workers, to keep that connection with the workplace and to provide survivors with the best chance of getting their life back in order after the epidemic of violence that so many workers face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there are some positives in this bill, but, as I said, it leaves out the key point. The scope of the problem really warrants a better response. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fourth national survey on sexual harassment in Australian workplaces</span> found that 40 per cent of womenâ€”that's more than one-third of all workersâ€”have been sexually harassed at work. That is a thoroughly unacceptable numberâ€”40 per cent of women, and that's more than a third of workers. So it's about bloody time we had this bill. I wish it were better, and I hope some of the amendments are passed to provide a safe workplace for women and all workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we had the Senate inquiry into this bill, the Women's Legal Centre ACT and JobWatch said that calls to their services about sexual harassment had increased threefold over the past two years. This problem is not going away; it is only getting worse. We need a broad-scale cultural change in workplaces, and in society more broadly, to make sure that women are not being sexually harassed in their place of work. Sexual harassment has serious and enduring impacts on workers, and everyoneâ€”on the broader society. It can destroy workers' self-esteem, confidence, productivity, career progression, and overall health and wellbeing. It is the ultimate example of the gender inequality that persists and the grip that patriarchy has on our decision-making organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also costs an awful lot. The cost of sexual harassment is estimated at $3.5 billion each year in lost productivity and each case of harassment represents around four working days of lost output. Parliament needs to fix this problem, not just in our own workplace but in workplaces everywhere. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report really canvassed the scope of the problem and it set out a comprehensive, targeted set of reforms to tackle it. It was a holistic package of 55 recommendations to address discrimination and the structural inequalities to make workplaces safe. We need to implement the full suite of those recommendations if we are to achieve the goal of safe and respectful workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government finally issued its response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> reportâ€”13 months after the factâ€”I read the press release and it claimed that it would implement all of the recommendations; it accepted all of the recommendations. Well, the devil was in the detail, because, now that we've seen the bill, the government, in fact, has not accepted all of the recommendations. It is failing to act on the main recommendations that Commissioner Jenkins made, which went to a positive duty on employers to maintain a safe workplace. That was the centrepiece of the report, and this bill doesn't even tackle it. It took the Greens to initiate an amendment weeks ago, and the Labor Party's now doing the same. In fact, I believe we're collaborating and we'll be moving a joint amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one should be blocking an obligation for employers to provide a safe workplace. I presume the government are going to vote against the amendment. Please, think before you do so. This should not be a political issue. The right of workers to be safe at work and the right of women to not be sexually harassed at any time, let alone in their workplace, should not be something that you can vote against. We'll wait to see how the vote goes, but I'm more and more incredulous at the new lows this government seems to find every single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill called for the implementation of the full suite of 55 recommendations. I don't know what more can be said about the need for it. Eliminating workplace sexual harassment will take a big cultural shift. It's long past time that we began that cultural shift. A positive duty to create and maintain a safe workplace is the best way to achieve that. The vast majority of submitters to the Senate inquiry emphasised that that positive duty was critical to achieve the broader objectives, and I really don't understand what the government are missing here in not seeing that the positive duty is in fact crucial. They contend that there's already a duty in the fair work laws, but it's clearly not working. If it were working, we wouldn't see one-third of workers being sexually harassed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was laughable, because even the Minerals Council of Australia, with whom I frequently disagree, agreed in the Senate inquiry. Tania Constable, their CEO, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">MCA agrees with the government and others that a positive duty already exists in workplace health and safety law â€¦ However, the positive duty that already exists works for traditional physical health and safety risks; it is clearly not working for sexual harassment. Therefore, given the significant issue, we support there being a positive duty in the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just the Minerals Council, whose tune the government usually dances to. It was also the ACTU, the CPSU, the Law Council, the Discrimination Law Experts Group, the National Foundation for Australian Women, the Women's Legal Centre, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Diversity Council. The vast majority of submitters could see that you've got to have a positive duty on employers to create a safe workplace or you won't fix this problem of 40 per cent of women being sexually harassed at work. So, as I mentioned, the Greens and Labor will be moving a joint amendment to give effect to that most central of recommendations by Commissioner Jenkins, and we beg the government to put politics aside and just do the right thing and support that amendment. It should have been in their own bill. There's no justification for not supporting that amendment. How can they possibly not want women to be safe at work? I genuinely don't understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll be moving some other amendments as well. An important one is on the need for representative action to be able to be taken. It takes an awful lot of guts for an individual worker to challenge their colleague or their boss, and it often comes at the expense of them keeping that role. It shouldn't be a weight just on individuals' shoulders. Representative actions should be allowed to be taken to fix what is a systemic issue. We also want to make sure that the Human Rights Commission can undertake reviews of systemic workplace issues of their own accord rather than just when the minister asks them to, and we want to make sure that costs are not a barrier to taking action. So we'll be moving that and a host of other amendments when it comes to the committee stageâ€”if we get to that stage before the election. The government has a women problem, and this bill really shows you why.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I rise to make some remarks about the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. These are serious issues because we want every Australian to have an equal chance at success in life. The data, regrettably, shows that there are many Australian women who are being harassed at work, and that is doing great damage not only to them but also to our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about work. Work is about a whole lot of things: it's about personal meaning and it's about economic participation. If we don't get these things right then the whole country is much diminished. We do have a problem with female workforce participation. We should be in a stronger position than we are. I think these are issues which have dogged workplaces for too long. The Human Rights Commission data from 2018 shows that two in five women are harassed at work, which is an extraordinarily high number when you think about Australia being a modern, advanced liberal democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner who performed this work, Kate Jenkins, has said, appropriately:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Workplace sexual harassment is not inevitable. It is not acceptable. It is preventable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's a good segue to a few remarks on these matters. My friend Kelly O'Dwyer commissioned this report some years ago when she was the Minister for Women. The former minister asked that there be a review into these matters, looking at reporting, risk factors, the legal framework, the existing measures that are used to deal with harassment and the impact on individuals who are harassed. The executive government, through the Attorney-General, has now decided to advance this report, which is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill puts a few planks down. The first is setting out that harassment is harassment, with a view to eliminating harassment in all workplaces. We in this place regulate the private economy with the slew of workplace laws we have. I often say we have too many, but in this case we clearly need more, as well as better enforcement. So this bill establishes that harassment is a legal and valid reason for dismissal. It gives more opportunities for the commission to put in place punitive measures like stop orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, it expands the mandate of the regime to public officials, including members of parliament, public servants, staff of members of parliament, and judges. I have to say I can't understand why all those people weren't already included in these arrangements. I think there is a very important principle at stake here, and that is that everyone's job is important and no-one should be in any different a position to anyone else when it comes to harassment. It doesn't matter who you work for or who you are; you cannot harass people at work. So I think including these additional people is a no-brainer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the broad thrust of this is to ensure that there are better tools and more punitive measures to stop harassment. Unless we are able to get on top of this, Australia as an advanced nation will stagnate on the question of female workforce participation. There are more men than women in the workplace, and I don't think that's a good thing. We want people to have an equal shot at economic participation. That is critical for our nation. As to these issues that have been dealt with in the report, I'm very pleased that our government is taking the lead on this. This is not the only part of the reform, but this is a big chunk of the report's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I note that there are some particular issues that the LGBTQI community, including the trans community, would like to see addressed in some form. It may be appropriate to address that here, or it may be appropriate to address it elsewhere, but I think the principle is sound: we want every Australian to have an equal crack at work and be safe at work to provide that economic participation. It shouldn't matter who you are. If there are minority groups that feel that they are in need of additional protections, I think that those should be seriously considered, because it is very important that countries like Australia go out of their way to protect minorities. Minorities are not there to be bashed up; minorities are there to be protected. I thank the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. The issue of sexual harassment in the workplace has come to the fore in recent years. It's been global: the Me Too movement has sought to hold the wealthy and powerful around the world accountable for sexual abuse. In Australia we've seen a former High Court judge, Justice Heydon, found to have sexually harassed six of his young female associates. There has been an alleged sexual assault in Australian Parliament House. I commend the bravery of Brittany Higgins for speaking out, both on her own behalf and in support of thousands of other survivors around Australia. There's been the March4Justice, where thousands of Australians marched hand in hand to demand gender equality and justice for victims of sexual assault. I was proud and humbled to join one of the marches on parliament's lawns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the pandemic of sexual harassment has become regular front-page news, it's not a new story for the vast majority of Australians, because 72 per cent of Australians over the age of 15 have been sexually harassed at some point in their lives. That includes 85 per cent of Australian women and 57 per cent of Australian men. The fact is that people in Australia and around the world, particularly women, have been forced to suffer sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace since time immemorial. It is a plague that I have personally encountered since the 1980s, when I was a union delegate representing workers at the Cronulla Workers Club, where some managers had an unwritten rule for young female workers: if you wanted to pick up more shifts, you had to sleep with the boss; if you refused, or if you stopped, your shifts would get cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an unthinkable situation for young women, who may have had to use those shifts to pay the bills or to put food on the table for their children. Those women did not have sufficient legislative protections; even if those protections had existed, it was difficult as an individual to enforce them. As is often the case, it was collective action and collective power that ultimately improved protections for young women at the Cronulla Workers Club. We reached an agreement with the club that their hours could not be cut if they had not been working a regular pattern of shifts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1990s, while I was at the Transport Workers Union, I recall the union being attacked for pursuing the introduction of paid parental leave. That was a fight the TWU eventually won, and paid parental leave was introduced into the award for truck drivers. I was proud to be a part of the fight, and I was prouder still when paid parental leave was enshrined in the National Employment Standards by the Rudd Labor government in 2010.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, when I was the National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, we reached an agreement on behalf of the workers, with worker representatives, with Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti for the introduction of five days paid domestic violence leave. We took the same proposal to Alan Joyce's Qantas, which fought tooth and nail against it. After a two-year-long fight, Qantas finally introduced that right in 2016. I commend Mr Borghetti and other business leaders who have recognised that Australians suffering domestic violence deserve to be supported by their employer. However, until paid domestic violence leave is guaranteed as a right by the federal government, people will continue to slip through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Job Security, we heard from Ms Terese Kingston, a domestic violence support worker at Mackay Women's Centre. She said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a woman in insecure and casual work who is unable to access sick leave, annual leave or domestic violence leave, the ability to safely leave an abusive situation is reduced significantly â€¦ I have seen multiple occasions where women have lodged private applications for protection orders and then are forced to withdraw because they are at risk of losing their job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Kingston goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tragically, I have then seen their names turn up on court lists again several months later â€¦ which tells us that they â€¦ have been victims of further violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No woman in Australia should have to choose between their job and their safety, or the safety of their children. That is why Labor is committed to enshrining 10 days paid domestic leave in the National Employment Standards. I urge the Morrison government to come on board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sexual harassment and abuse continue to plague men and women in workplaces around Australia. Harassment at work often occurs when someone in a position of power preys on someone who is more vulnerable. As work in Australia becomes more precarious, the power imbalance becomes even more pronounced. As more and more Australians are engaged as casuals, contractors, in part-time work, on rolling contracts or short-term contracts, through labour hire companies, or as gig workers with no rights whatsoever, it becomes harder and riskier to speak out about harassment at work. If your contract or your shifts can be cut at the drop of a hat then, just as I saw at the Cronulla Workers Club almost 40 years ago, sexual harassment and abuse can become rife. In fact, this was highlighted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Work</span> report itself, which said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly true for young women, who are more likely to be carrying out insecure work and more likely to experience sexual harassment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We conducted an extensive survey of more than 400 young women working in hospitality in â€¦ 2017, and we found nine out of 10 of those workers had been sexually harassed at work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you are employed from one shift to the next and you have no guaranteed hours, it puts you in a position where you're unable to speak up. Ms Mairead Lesman, the Director of the Young Workers Centre, told us about the case of an apprentice chef:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the disgraceful state of sexual harassment and assault protections in the gig economy. Companies like Uber classify their workers as contractors to avoid any responsibility or obligation for their safety. A survey by the TWU found that 44 per cent of female ride-share drivers suffered sexual harassment while working. What sort of protections do they have? Karen, a female Uber driver, was sexually harassed by a passenger last year. After she lodged the complaint, Uber banned her from the platform. Karen had also been sexually assaulted two years earlier while working for Uber. After the assault, the perpetrator left her a one-star rating, which impacted her ability to earn income and to get appropriate shifts. Even after a police complaint was filed, Uber never rescinded that rating. With exploitative employers like Uber, if you're harassed or raped at work, your rapist can leave a permanent rating of your performance. It's horrific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the real stories of Australians in insecure work. Sexual harassment is so widespread, and it particularly impacts those who are already vulnerable and economically insecure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report is so important. I want to commend Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins and her team for their comprehensive inquiry and their exceptional report. The Australian Human Rights Commission received 460 submissions, conducted 60 consultations and produced a 930-page report. There can be no question or doubt about the degree of detail and care that's gone into the report and into the 55 practical and carefully considered recommendations that Commissioner Jenkins put forward, which makes it so disappointing that the government's response has fallen so short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is bitterly disappointing, but it's not surprising. We have a Prime Minister who could empathise with Ms Higgins only after his wife had urged him to imagine how he would want his own daughters treated. We have a Prime Minister who has refused to launch an investigation into the very serious allegations against the former Attorney-General Mr Porter. We have a Prime Minister who, instead, has reinstated Mr Porter as acting Leader of the House. We have a Prime Minister who refused to meet with the March4Justice protesters and then suggested that they should be grateful they weren't met with force. When we have a Prime Minister who has demonstrated, time and time again, a complete inability to understand or empathise with survivors of sexual abuse, it's no surprise that the bill Mr Morrison put forward falls short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has taken more than a year and a half for Mr Morrison to present his legislation in response to the report. The <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">espect@W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report was first presented to the government as early as January 2020, and the former Attorney-General, Mr Porter, did not meet even once with Commissioner Jenkins about the report or its recommendations. Sadly, Mr Morrison's bill implements only a handful of the report's recommendations. Mr Morrison owes survivors around Australia an explanation of why he has stalled and delayed his response to this report and why he has now failed to implement many of its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the full adoption and implementation of all recommendations in the report. The Labor dissenting report on the bill provides a full breakdown of many of the recommendations that Mr Morrison has not adopted. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendation 15, which calls on the government to ratify the International Labour Organization convention on violence and harassment. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendations 16b and 16c, which would prohibit the creation of a hostile environment. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendations 17 and 18, which call for the introduction of an enforceable positive duty on all employers to take reasonable measures to eliminate sex discrimination and sexual harassment in their workplace. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendation 19, which would amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to provide the commission with the powers to inquire into systematic unlawful discrimination. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendation 23, which would amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to allow representative groups, such as unions, to bring representative claims to court. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendation 25, which would amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to insert a cost protection provision consistent with the existing provisions in the Fair Work Act. Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendation 28, which would amend the Fair Work Act to expressly prohibit sexual harassment. And Mr Morrison has not adopted recommendation 16a, which would amend the Sex Discrimination Act to introduce a new object to achieve equality between women and men. Instead, the wording in Mr Morrison's bill uses the phrasing 'to achieve, so far as practicable, equality of opportunity between men and women'. What a joke. It certainly seems that Morrison has inserted the phrase 'so far as practicable' because Mr Morrison is only interested in tackling gender inequality when it won't be inconvenient to himself and other men who benefit from it. Even when there are sexual assaults in his own workplaceâ€”in the ministerial wing of the Australian parliamentâ€”the extent to which Mr Morrison cares about this issue is the extent to which it impacts his own personal popularity and political fortunes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for the 72 per cent of Australians who have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime, and for the millions of other Australians who know someone who has been impacted, this bill is not good enough. And this issue will not be swept away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, sexual abuse in the workplace continues around Australia. A recent survey by the mining and energy union and the Australian Workers Union found that two-thirds of female fly-in fly-out mine workers in Western Australia had been subjected to verbal sexual harassment, 22 per cent said they'd been offered better working conditions in exchange for sexual favours and one in five said they'd experienced sexual assault. Most telling of all, almost half of female FIFO workers said they did not believe that reporting sexual harassment was encouraged by managers. They also said that they feared being blacklisted as troublemakers if they came forward. That is a damning indictment of some of the richest and most powerful companies in Australia and of the government which allows it to continue.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  [by video link] As other speakers have noted, the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021 enacts the government's response to Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins's 2020 <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. That outstanding report made 55 recommendations to address widespread and pervasive sexual harassment in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a sad reality that so many girls and women around us have experienced such harassment while at work. The Human Rights Commission's 2018 sexual harassment survey aptly titled 'Everyone's business' revealed that 39 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace in the previous five years. If we look over a lifetime, 85 per cent of women and 57 per cent of men said they had experienced it at some point in their lives, and most experienced of them had experienced it multiple times. This is not a niche problem; it is very much mainstream. The behaviours the survey reported range from suggestive comments, offensive jokes, indecent messages and insulting or explicit questions to leering, sexually explicit gifts, sexual nagging, inappropriate invitations, unwelcome touching, indecent exposure and attempted or actual sexual assault. That list is not exhaustive. Unfortunately, most incidents like this go unreported, even though they can make an employee feel unsafe or diminished in what should be a professional environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Jenkins noted in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report that the rate of change since the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 more than 35 years ago had been 'disappointingly slow'. We still put the onus on the victim to speak up and take action against their colleagues or employers. That can be extremely difficult to do when you're starting out in a workplace or when you're very much dependent on keeping your job as so many people are. Unless we make concerted efforts to tackle these behaviours at work, nothing will change. Unless we do more to prevent harassment and support employees, this harassment will only continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes some good first steps, such as enabling the Fair Work Commission to issue stop orders for harassment. But I agree with many other senators before me that the bill does not go far enough to implement the recommendations of Commissioner Jenkins's report. In her report, the commissioner says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Workplace sexual harassment is not inevitable. It is not acceptable. It is preventable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She also notes that a safe and harassment-free workplace is also a productive workplace. I think that is self-evident to all of us. It is only logical that employers be asked to do more to prevent harassment in the workplace for those reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report recommended that the Sex Discrimination Act be amended to include a positive duty on employers, except perhaps the very smallest businesses, to take reasonable steps to prevent sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. It seems the absence of this positive duty means that many employers focus on only complying with work, health and safety laws, which means it is solely up to the victim to initiate action. The government does not appear to consider this positive duty necessary, because there is an implied duty to prevent harassment in WHS laws that require employers to provide a safe workplace and to reasonably avoid health and safety risks. If this is the case, I see no harm, and, in fact, only benefit, in making that duty explicit, telling employers that it is their job to make sure they educate and protect employees from this type of harm, as they do with any other workplace harms, and that they cannot turn a blind eye to sexual and gender based harassment or dismiss it as just a bit of fun.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other proposed amendments that take this bill from being a significant first step, which is how the Senate inquiry report described it, to making it a more fulsome piece of legislation that better reflects the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. I intend to support all the amendments that enact those missed recommendations, as they are sensible and necessary if we are to get this reform through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To continue to ensure we stamp out opportunities for abuse and harassment, I foreshadow that I have a second reading amendment that will ask the federal government to work with the states and territories to ensure that employers and managers who routinely hire teenagers under the age of 18 are required to undertake working-with-children checks. This issue was raised during the Senate inquiry, and it struck me as being common sense that we address this loophole to protect teenagers embarking on their first jobs, many of which are in the retail and fast-food sectors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SDA told the inquiry that 51 per cent of its female members aged 15 to 17 years of age had experienced sexual harassment in the last five years. That is a shocking number. Teenage boys aren't immune. Fourteen per cent of teen boys also experienced sexual harassment. The union's national assistant secretary, Julia Fox, told the inquiry: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Do parents know that their child, their daughter, is more likely to be sexually harassed at work than not? What environment are we sending our kids into? It's their first job, and this is what happens. Both retail and fast food industries also employ large numbers of children under the age of 18, yet there is no requirement to have a working with children check. A volunteer coach at the netball club or the football club and, indeed, a parent coach is required to have one, but a manager at a McDonald's or a supermarket isn't, yet, they too, are working with children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not naive enough to think that working-with-children checks will stamp out this problemâ€”not by a long shotâ€”but it does make it more explicit to employers that they have an obligation, a duty of care, to ensure their young employees are safe from sexual harassment while at work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, this bill is a very good starting point, but it is not the end point. I will support this bill, and, as I mentioned, I will also support key amendments that enact further recommendations of Commissioner Jenkins's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report.</span>

Since the Sex Discrimination Act was first introduced, in 1984, we've come a long way. However, since then, time and time again, we are unfortunately reminded that the work is not done and that there is still more to do. That is why I'm so grateful that we have people such as Kate Jenkins, who does such important work to make Australia a better place. As Ms Jenkins states in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work </span>report:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sexual harassment is not a women's issue: it is a societal issue, which every Australian, and every Australian workplace, can contribute to addressing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's commitment to creating effective, meaningful policies to positively improve women's workforce issues is why the government funded the Australian Human Rights Commission to undertake its landmark National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces, the first of its kind in the world. The national inquiry found that, sadly, too many workplaces fall short and that women across Australia are still subject to harassment and discrimination. The government's response to the national inquiry, which was released in April 2021, is about creating a new culture of respectful behaviour in Australian workplaces. It provides a clear and comprehensive path forward to prevent and address workplace sexual harassment, while supporting meaningful culture change in Australian workplaces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry found that the existing legal and regulatory frameworks for addressing workplace harassment are complex and difficult to navigate. This, as a result, has made it difficult for many victims to deal with their cases of discrimination and harassment. That is why the government is acting quickly to strengthen the national antidiscrimination and industrial relations frameworks, by simplifying and enhancing protections against sex based harassment and discrimination in the workplace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see change and we want this change to happen as quickly as possible. If we are to be successful, state and territory governments, industry groups, professional organisations, employers, workers and the private sector all have an ongoing role to play in building a culture of safe and respectful workplaces in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the majority of the legislative recommendations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, focusing on the changes that can be implemented quickly that will see the greatest improvement to the antidiscrimination and industrial relations frameworks. The bill would also amend the existing entitlement to compassionate leave to enable an employee to take up to two days of paid compassionate leave if the employee or their spouse or de facto partner experiences a miscarriage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sets out very clearly that this government has no tolerance for sexual harassment in the workplace. This bill will make important changes to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This act provides an important framework to protect against discrimination as well as discrimination involving harassment. Importantly, this bill will introduce a new objects clause of achieving equality of opportunity between men and women. This is an important objective; however, it is not an objective that legislative reform can solve on its own. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report concluded that sex based harassment, while it is already prohibited, is not well understood, which is why steps have been taken in this bill to clarify that sex based harassment is unlawful. Importantly, this bill will ensure that prohibitions against sexual harassment and sex based harassment cover all forms of workers. This means that the current exemption for state public servants will be removed, and it will be clarified, at the government's own initiative, that the Sex Discrimination Act applies to members of parliament, ministerial staff and judges. We want to ensure that, no matter the workplace and no matter your work status, you are protected by law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments will be made to the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to reduce procedural barriers in order to encourage complaints. This will be done by providing that the president's discretion to terminate a complaint initiated under the Sex Discrimination Act arises after 24 months. In addition to the reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act, amendments will be made to the Fair Work Act so that it is clear what actions can be taken to deal with workplace sexual harassment. By adding a new legislative note in the unfair dismissal provisions, it will be clarified that workplace sexual harassment is a valid reason for dismissal. This bill will also make clear that the Fair Work Commission can, within the existing stop-bullying jurisdiction, make orders to stop sexual harassment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments highlight this government's commitment to eliminating the scourge of workplace sexual and gender based harassment that lurks within our society. We are calling on every leader of government possible to address this issue and we will continue to do so. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we announced in the 2021-22 budget, the government is providing more than $64 million over four years to implement the government's response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. This builds on the initial $2.1 million over three years provided in October 2020 to implement the key recommendations of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this bill outlines, the Morrison government is committed to taking action by expanding the scope of existing harassment provisions, promoting clarity for employers and workers and reducing procedural barriers for sexual harassment complaints. With these, we can ensure that, under the legislative frameworks, all Australians are protected from sexual harassment and sexual discrimination. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  [by video link] I also would like to make a contribution to this debate on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. This bill represents the government's response to the Australian Human Rights Commission's landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. It amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 and the Fair Work Act 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, broadly, supporting this bill because we understand and appreciate that the issue of providing a safe workplace for all Australians is too important to delay. The work needs to be done urgently. But we also acknowledge that the government has completely missed this lesson. For eight yearsâ€”eight long yearsâ€”they've known that important work needs to be done, and they have not done it. And they've taken far too long to respond to this landmark report. Theirs is a half-hearted, partial response to what is a detailed and comprehensive report about a problem that Australian women from all walks of life deal with throughout their lives and which many of them deal with multiple times in their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner found that Australia's existing laws relating to sexual harassment are out of date and that they are failing to protect workers. The commission found that reform is urgently needed, and that's a view shared by many, many stakeholders. The reform work is urgent, but this government sat on the report for more than a year. The report sat with then Attorney-General Christian Porter, who didn't do a thing, and it was only earlier this year, when the incredibly brave women came forward to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault, that this government was shamed into action. As a result, instead of the detailed, careful, considered policy response that we should expect to a report like this, what we've seen is a kneejerk political response to what is a serious, ongoing, society-wide problem. One in three people experienced sexual harassment at work in the past five years: 40 per cent of women and around 25 per cent of men. First Nations Australians were more likely to experience workplace sexual harassment than nonâ€“First Nations people. And, if these statistics weren't bad enough and shocking enough to spur the government into action, we know that widespread workplace harassment costs the Australian economy $3Â½ billion a year. All of these statistics should shock us. But for many Australians they're not shocking because this is the reality of life that they live every single day. They know these statistics because they live these statistics. They make up these statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report tells us that harassment is happening everywhere but certain industries place people at even greater risk. We know that retail, hospitality, healthcare and social assistance workers are at particular risk, as are women, young people, those in precarious and insecure work and those from diverse backgrounds. These people are overrepresented in these industries and can be overrepresented in the statistics. And, of course, we've heard terrible, terrible allegations of harassment in this workplace: the federal parliamentâ€”a workplace that should set the standard for workplace safety. It should set the standard for acceptable behaviour. And I do want to acknowledge the incredibly brave women who came forward, and those who continue to come forward, to talk about this and to shine a light on it. It's incredibly important that you do that, and we're listening and we believe you. But it shouldn't take the bravery of young women to come forward to force the government to act on protecting women at work and to get them interested in this area of policy reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to stamping out sexual harassment across society, but we need to see the same urgency of commitment from the government. Back in April, the Prime Minister said the government had agreed to all the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, but, as is too often the case with the Morrison government, when you take a closer look at the detail you will be disappointed. Many of the recommendations were only agreed in part or in principle. Others were simply noted. They want the credit for the strong response, but the strong response actually requires detailed policy work to follow it through. Too many recommendations are either not being acted on or have been largely ignoredâ€”essentially, watering down key elements of the response we should see to this report. So, whilst Labor supports this bill broadly, my colleague Jenny McAllister will be moving amendments to the bill. Importantly, one of these amendments would provide for 10 days of paid domestic violence leave. While this was not a specific recommendation of this report, we know from stakeholders and from women with lived experience that this is an essential reform to ensure women's safety at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many stakeholders have called the government's response to this report 'a missed opportunity'â€”a missed opportunity like many missed opportunities in policy work that we've seen from this government. Let's just be clear: Labor supports all 55 recommendations. We want to send a clear and unambiguous message that sexual harassment must stop, and to do that you need to support this report in full. Sexual harassment must stop in all workplaces across the entire country. We are committed to doing what it takes to do this. We are committed to doing the hard, detailed policy work required to keep people safe at work. We believe in it. It is core to our mission as a labour party and a labour movement. We will never stop fighting until men and women get the dignity and respect at work that they deserve.</span>

These should not be controversial statements. These should be outcomes, across the board, across the political spectrum, that we should be seeing and achieving across all parts of life. Sadly, that's not the reality.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the incredible work of my colleague Senator Waters in the portfolio of women and the work of all Australian Greens MPs who are advocating for gender equality. This is fundamental to who we Greens are as a party. That's why we need to see clear and urgent action so that this reality of genuine gender equality across the board is reached. We need that action so that women are safe at work and so that the recommendations of the landmark Jenkins <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report are actually implemented, including the core recommendation that there should be a positive duty on employers to ensure a safe workplace. The right of women to be safe at work should not be controversial and, particularly given that the Kate Jenkins recommendations were given to government at the beginning of last year, it should not be something that we are lagging on. The government has been so slow off the mark, and it is so disappointing to see a response that doesn't go to this core recommendation of the Jenkins review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is so important. We have to overcome the situation where, currently, one-third of workers in Australian workplaces report being sexually harassed and where forty per cent of women report being sexually harassed at work. These are just the most appalling situations. You would think that a government faced with those statistics would really be pulling out all the stops to do everything possible to address this problemâ€”to make sure that we dramatically reduce the experience of sexual harassment, to cut through women's experience of sexual harassment at work and to do everything possible to address it. The government should be doing everything it can to promote gender equality and build a fairer society.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Waters has spoken this morning on our overall response to this legislation, the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021, and what changes we Greens think should be enacted in our laws to support women. I fully support the measures that she has outlined in her speech. You can take that as read. What I want to focus on today, as the Greens spokesperson for LGBTIQA+ people, is the fact that we've also got an opportunity to make some changes to our legislative framework that will improve outcomes for people who are transgender, people who are gender diverse and non-binary and people who have variations in sex characteristics, because these people are also dramatically impacted by gender inequality, and equality should not be negotiable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, on the basis of people who are transgender, gender diverse and non-binary and people with variations in sex characteristics, there is discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Just do some sums in your head. If 30 per centâ€”almost a thirdâ€”of all workers in Australia report having experienced sexual harassment at work and 40 per cent of women experience sexual harassment at work, just have a think about what the levels of sexual harassment are for people in these groups. When for each of these groups there is very much a level of one or two or even more people who are more likely to experience sexual harassment, that is what their experience is going to be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to focus on the fact that in our legislation that would protect people of diverse gender identities and people with variations in sex characteristics there are gaping holes that are not being addressed by the legislation being proposed today. In particular, gender identity and sex characteristics are not attributes currently protected under the Fair Work Act. I'd like to draw on some work by the advocate and activist Alastair Lawrie, who noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the Fair Work Act 2009 does not protect trans, gender diverse and intersex people against workplace discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While this legislation prohibits adverse treatment on the basis of sexual orientationâ€”thereby protecting lesbians, gay men and bisexuals (at least to some extent â€¦)â€”it does not include equivalent protections for trans, gender diverse and intersex people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In short, the Fair Work Act 2009 does not protect trans, gender diverse and intersex Australians from mistreatment or unfair dismissal based on who they are. This is either a gross oversight, or a deliberate choice to treat transphobic and intersexphobic workplace discrimination less seriously than other forms of mistreatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only are trans or gender diverse people or people with variations in sex characteristics not protected from sexual harassment or discrimination when they are at work; there is also considerable discrimination going on when it comes to trans and gender diverse people or people with variations in sex characteristics actually gaining employment. So we've got a situation where people are struggling to actually get a job. So many trans and gender-diverse people and non-binary people just don't get jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is tragic, and this is the reality: trans and gender diverse and non-binary people with variations in sex characteristics are being discriminated against now, under our existing legislation. We've got the opportunity today. I'm putting forward some amendments to the government's legislation today that would address these issues, that would enable us to make gender identity and the variations in sex characteristics protected attributes. There is an opportunity to do that to improve this legislation today.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">While 4.5% of respondents reported being unfairly treated 'always' or 'a lot' in the past 12 months because of their sexual orientation, 19.8% of respondents reported the same with respect to their gender identity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile, although intersex status was not included in the above questions, when asked whether they currently felt accepted 'a lot' or 'always' at work, only 50% of intersex respondents answered yes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that the legislation before us today is an opportunity to address this gap. Given this legislation is a response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, overall in our Greens engagement we are focusing on the important work being done to make safer workplaces for women. I again want to commend Senator Waters for her work on this issue. But what we're asking with regard to trans people, gender-diverse people, non-binary people and people with variations in sex characteristics is quite simple: to make minor amendments to the Fair Work Act to ensure that the attributes that are protected under the Sex Discrimination Act are also protected under the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to be moving two amendments later on in the debate on this bill. The first one would adopt a newer definition for 'sex characteristics' which would draw on recent state legislation, which is now understood to be best practice. It would be updating the Sex Discrimination Act to change the definition of 'intersex people' to 'people with variations in sex characteristics'. Another amendment I'm going to be moving, which I've requested after discussions with colleagues, does something similar. I do want to thank the procedure office for their quick work in preparing it at short notice. That amendment takes a slightly different technical approach. Rather than creating a new definition in federal legislation for 'sex characteristics', it would simply include 'intersex' status in the Fair Work Act by reference to the Sex Discrimination Act. That one is not our preferred optionâ€”and I'll speak more to it when we're in the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really hope that either of these amendments will be adopted so that we can change our legislation so that people who are transgender, gender-diverse or non-binary or who have variations in sex characteristics can be protected under our laws just as other people are and so that we can take the steps forward that we need to be taking to ensure that we are truly reaching equalityâ€”whether it's equality for women, equality for gender-diverse people or equality for people with variations in sex characteristics. We need to actually reach equality. It's not good enough to just continue to be on the journey towards equality. We have an opportunity today to be taking strong, simple action to move us towards actually reaching equality for all Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  [by video link] It's my pleasure to rise and speak on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. Sexual harassment is a blight upon our workplaces. It corrupts the bonds of trust which workers should develop with one another and clothes its victims in fear and shame. It is absolutely unacceptable that this kind of behaviour still persists in our great nation. As we heard in this debate, the statistics on sexual harassment in Australia tell a grim tale. Very concerningly, the Australian Human Rights Commission found, in 2018, that only 17 per cent of those who experienced sexual harassment in the previous five years had come forward to make a formal complaint. This means that most victims of sexual harassment suffer in silence. We cannot allow this situation to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just one of the ways the government has responded to the need to bolster and supplement our already strong laws against sexual harassment. In particular, it responds substantially to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, and I want to commend the exceptionally hard work of Kate Jenkins. The bill makes a wide range of improvements, such as clarifying that harassing a person on the basis of sex is prohibited under the Sex Discrimination Act by making this explicit on the face of the act. It provides that more workers will be protected from sexual harassment, particularly vulnerable workers, volunteers, interns and self-employed persons. It extends the time frame for which a complaint can be made to the Australian Human Rights Commission to reduce procedural barriers for complainants under the Sex Discrimination Act. It clarifies that the Fair Work Commission may make orders to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, which is a very important provision of course. It clarifies that sexual harassment can be a valid reason for dismissal under the Fair Work Actâ€”another very important provision. And the Sex Discrimination Act aims to achieve so far as practicable equality of opportunity between men and women. It also amends the Sex Discrimination Act so that a person who assists someone to sexually harass a person can also be found to have engaged in unlawful conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the kind of bill which the Australian people expect from this government. It is based on sound evidence, it is realistic and it is effective. It is also a bill that is the result of the hard work of the coalition government. I want to particularly recognise the former Minister for Women, Kelly O'Dwyer, who initiated the Respect@Work inquiry which resulted in these recommendations and now this bill before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard in this debate, Labor and the Greens are very good at throwing mud, but sex discrimination hasn't just been an issue since our government was elected in 2013. It was very much thriving when Labor was in power, yet we saw no such measures from Labor to provide these important protections in the workplace. The government's commitment to women was also highlighted in the recent budget, and it is incredibly substantial, with over $3 billion worth of funding allocated for women's safety, women's economic security, affordable child care, health and wellbeing, and domestic violence support. The government is also providing more than $64 million over four years to implement its response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, including over $43 million for additional legal assistance funding for specialist lawyers with workplace and discrimination law expertise. As we have seen in the budget, as we have seen in this bill and as we have seen in all of the other government's measures, the government's commitment to women is unmatched.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In keeping with this commitment, the bill doesn't stop at just sexual harassment; it also includes a very significant amendment to the Fair Work Act to enable an employee to take compassionate leave if they or their spouse or de facto partner have a miscarriage. Not only will this promote women's workforce participation and women's economic security; it also represents government at its bestâ€”caring for those whose lives have been seared with the scars of suffering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly address the concerns raised by senators opposite, particularly Senator Waters, because I am concerned that the government's position in relation to some recommendations made by Commissioner Jenkins has been substantially misrepresented.</span>

I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to aged-care workers for all their hard work and dedication and the care they give right around this country to older Australians. In the last 18 months with COVID-19 it has been particularly difficult for those in this sector to care for older Australians because they themselves, their families and the people they are charged with caring for have all been at risk. In this sector we have seen a lack of resources to look after the most vulnerable Australians. All aged-care workers have gone beyond what we could have expected of them to ensure the safety of older Australians and to give them the support that they so richly deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last eight years of Liberal governments we have seen this system in complete and utter chaos, with crisis after crisis. Really the only way you can categorise this sector now is as severely neglected. The Morrison government has passed from failed minister to failed minister charge of this sector. They have desperately failed to protect older Australians and in particular to support aged-care workers in this country. They have refused to support a pay rise for them. There are still 60,000 aged-care workers in this country who do not have a vaccine. This is outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has proven time and time again it undervalues aged-care workers in this country. It's not good enough. It's another election promise that Scott Morrison has failed to deliver on. He said he was going to make aged care a priority of his government. He has failed. He has failed so dismally that we have seen too many deaths in this country. It's outrageous. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In the quiet, deserted streets of Melbourne there are no conversations and no people meeting. Through telephone calls and zoom calls I'm told all the conversation is almost always the same. Parents, doctors and teachers are all concerned. Recent reports indicate that in my home state of Victoria more than 340 teenagers a week are ending up in the hospital with mental health emergenciesâ€”an 83 per cent rise on last year and a 162 per cent increase from 2019. Anyone will tell you that these figures are truly horrific. It's a clear indication of the negative effects of the 212 days of the Andrews government's lockdowns. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While battling one health pandemic it is essential that we do not create another one. Return to school can only be achieved with safety at front of mind. What is occurring right now is simply untenable. Our young people need to go back to school. Once all school staff members are vaccinated there would be no reason this could not happen. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our wonderful, highly educated teachers know that social interaction is a fundamental prerequisite for learning. Many years of research make it clear that social cohesion is essential for educational and cultural assimilation, especially in the formative years. These teachers want face-to-face teaching because they know it is best for the children. Parents want it because they can see that their children need it. </span>

Often, when we raise these issues we hear, 'What are the alternatives of going to war?' and, 'How else could we have addressed the issue of terrorism and the scourge of the Taliban 20 years ago?' We can approach our foreign policy and our defence policy differently. There are alternatives to going to war.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to mention a feminist approach to foreign policy that is being developed around the globe. The Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ a feminist approach to foreign policy â€¦ challenges the modus operandi of current political processes. It means ensuring equal participation across all hierarchies in all institutions shaping and implementing foreign policy, from ministries to embassies and implementing partners. It constantly evaluates whether political processes allow for equal influence of the politically marginalised, and actively seeks the cooperation of civil society actors promoting gender equality and the rights of political minorities. A feminist foreign policy also acknowledges the continuing colonial legacies within foreign affairs and actively works to overcome them. Most importantly, a feminist foreign policy always champions co-operation over domination. It fosters partnerships and inclusion over of domination and exclusion. It emphasises the shared communalities of human beings across the globe instead of reinforcing divisions and distinguishing between "us" and "them".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By having a feminist approach to foreign policy we are actually supporting collaboration. I think there is a lot that we could be learning in Australia. Rather than immediately thinking, 'We have a conflict; there are problems; we've got to go to war,' there are collaborative approaches to be doing things differently.</span>

As a country we ask an incredible amount of these amazing women. We want them to provide the best-quality personal care for their residents, we want them to know each resident's needs completely and we want them to not just care for those physical needs but also connect with, comfort and support their residents. In COVID we want our aged-care workers to be the front line of preventing infection in a really high risk environment. As a country we want all of this for just over $20 an hour, and it is a national disgrace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to stop expecting so much of these dedicated, skilled, professional women while offering them so little in return. We know aged-care workers love their jobs. They love to care. But, as so many aged-care workers have told me, love just does not pay the rent. It's time for our country to stop wanting the impossible from our aged-care workers. It's time to stop expecting these dedicated, skilled and compassionate women to do this critical work for so little return. It's time to respect our essential aged-care workers not just with our words but in their wages, not just with our thanks but also in good, secure jobs that they can count on. There are so many reasons that we need to do it. We need to do it for these amazing women to have their own economic security. We need to do it for our country to build the long-term workforce that we need in this sector. We need to do it for all of us to have the high-quality aged-care system that workers want and we need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  [by video link] The national accounts figures published yesterday carried great news for our community and very bad news for those in the Senate for whom 'mining' is a dirty word. Australia's balance of trade surplus is now at a 10-year high, just over $10 billion in June, up from $9 billion in May. Every dollar of surplus is $1 of growth for the Australian economy, generating jobs and economic security and making Australia more resilient. Every $10 increase in the iron ore or coal price adds $1 billion to government revenue. Overall, metal ore exports reached a record high in April of $16Â½ billion. That's $16.5 billion in mining exports in one month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider all the employment this is creatingâ€”the breadwinner jobs, the families supported by individual labour rather than by government handouts. Investment in mining is an investment in our future securityâ€”it's that simple. Iron ore is now at $154 a tonne and coal is at $171 a tonneâ€”both against budget projections of $40 a tonne. The government has a windfall here. Copper is up 23 per cent, steel is up 24 per cent, nickel is up 15 per cent and cobalt is up 57 per cent. Our mining recovery is broadly based and sustained. This revenue must go, in part, to building Australian infrastructure, which is our future, and, in part, to paying back our profligate deficit, caused by temporary COVID measures that now somehow appear permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet Labor and the Greens are telling miners, 'Bad luck,' because both want to ban any new mines and extensions of existing mines. Their policy will devastate the economy and the government revenue base. Entire communities will be reliant on government welfare and any rules imposed on them in order to keep the benefits. No wonder the Greens and Labor hate mining. There will be none of this supporting of ourselves under a government Anthony Albanese and Adam Bandt lead. We are one community, we are one nation, and mining will keep us free.</span>

Professor Patrick McGorry, arguably the most respected mental health expert in the country, has spoken of the 'shadow pandemic' in relation to mental health issues. This has been significantly felt by our young people, who have had to deal with school closures, lockdowns and learning from home. Our own chief psychiatrist in New South Wales, Dr Murray Wright, has spoken of a 31 per cent increase this year in emergency department presentations by children and teenagers for self-harm and suicidal ideation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that lockdowns and learning from home are difficult, and our young people are really feeling the pinch. As we speak, some of our young people are going into final exams and assessments without having spent a full school term in the classroom. It's devastating.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  [by video link] An enduring problem with superannuation is that many Australians have, without knowing so, invested in super funds with high fees and low returns. Many, without doubt, would be better off switching funds. But working out how to do this is often confusing and very stressful. Of course, not doing anything means less money for their retirement, and more money for retirement is certainly something that everyone wants to have. I supported the Your Future, Your Super reforms because they were going to help those very people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to see one of those measures actually taking effect today, with APRA publishing the results of the super fund performance tests. Funds that fail the test will be named and shamed. They will have to, in fact, notify members that they have failed and they must include the words, 'You should consider moving your money into a different fund.' Those are very, very powerful words. It's a very strong message, one which will have three beneficial effectsâ€”firstly, many workers looking for a new fund will choose not to invest in those failing products; secondly, some members of failing funds will invest elsewhere; and, thirdly, failing funds will have to change how they operate or close down entirely. The overall effect is that these requirements will flush out some of the rot from the super sector. All three effects will benefit Australians in their retirement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The super reforms were bitterly contested, but I was an enthusiastic supporter because they will benefit the people who elected me. I was not elected by dud fund managers, ex-union bosses or executives pulling seven-figure salaries but by ordinary working Australians who want a dignified, financially secure retirement, and I'm very proud of it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He was one of the stockmen who walked off Wave Hill in 1966, led by Vincent Lingiari. He was a remarkable man who leaves behind an even bigger legacy. He protested against the poor conditions and to take back the land that belonged to them. This is why it was so important to be able to celebrate Freedom Day here in the Northern Territory. For those of us who have walked in the footprints behind Mr Wavehill, Mr Lingiari and so many other Gurindji leaders, now is the time to reflect, when we lose our elders. We didn't have the celebration this year because of COVID. We may have the celebration later this year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Gough Whitlam who symbolically passed a handful of sand to the old man, Vincent Lingiari. Fifty-five years on, the community still wish to celebrate the birthplace of land rights, and that anniversary was last Monday. While it is sad that it has been cancelled, I know that the community are looking forward to when they can have people back to Kalkarindji and can celebrate the life of an amazing man, Mr Wavehill. The movement with Mr Lingiari, whose grandchildren joined the fight last year to maintain the electorate of Lingiari in the NT, was so critical to us being able to save the seat in Lingiari, along with, obviously, now the seat of Solomon. My heart goes out to all the families in Kalkarindji; the Wave Hill people; Rosie Smiler; all the grandchildren; but also the Gurindji association, the men and women who work tirelessly; and the union movement, who are still very much part of the way of life of the Wave Hill people. This is an important year. I send my best wishes not just from myself but also my family. Bauji barra.</span>

Part of the criticism was of its unilateral decision to refuse to continue to deliver perishable goods. In my home state of Tasmania, Australia Post's decision caused uncertainty, dislocation and job insecurity. Having achieved a moratorium on the decision, the small-business ombudsman, Bruce Billson, was called in to help develop a solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that a solution has been found, with Australia Post committing itself to continuing to deliver perishable goods across Australia. Many jobs are dependent on getting our fine products to market. Individual purchasers' buying habits are now more internet based, with direct sales going from producer to the door. Australia Post's reconsideration of their duty is much appreciated by both producers and consumers. The decision means Tasmanian businesses like Tasmanian Gourmet Online, Ashgrove Cheese and 41 Degrees South can continue to have their highly sought after, premium-quality products delivered to their discerning consumers. Food safety issues have been worked through exceptionally carefully to ensure perishable products arrive in a manner ensuring consumer safety. Australia Post can again truly say about its service: 'We deliver.' On behalf of Tasmania's premium food sector workers, whose jobs depend on a safe, reliable service delivery, a big thank you to all involved in overcoming this impasse. It has secured jobs, families and communities in my home state of Tasmania.</span>

When I see news reports talking about import terminals for gas, that's what I think: total policy failure. Australia exports two units of gas for every one unit that it uses domestically. Unfortunately, we export the cheap gas to competing Asian markets and we retain the more expensive gas for use here in Australia.</span>

This is despite a fall in domestic consumption. That tells you there's something awfully wrong from an economic fundamentals perspective. What's the cause? Well, it is not a shortage of gas. It is, firstly, exportsâ€”exporting gas at the expense of supply here in Australia. In 2018-19, $62 billion worth of gas was exported, and we got $1 billion in PRRT. So we're exporting it but not getting any benefit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a cartel operating on the east coast of Australia. We also have a monopoly in terms of gas pipelines. We have to do something about this. Firstly, we need to pool the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism to make sure there is enough gas here. We also need to look at things like a reservation policy, which the government have announced but haven't dealt with. We have a total policy failure when it comes to gas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to speak about some very mysterious things that seem to be happening in Central Queensland, particularly in Rockhampton. This weekend, the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin reported that Senator Pauline Hanson had secured $8 million of federal funding for a new hospice in Rockhampton. This is a good project. I've actually met with the proponents of this project myself. But the question must be asked: why is it that federal government fundingâ€”Morrison government fundingâ€”is being announced by a One Nation senator?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time I looked, Rockhampton was in the electorate of Capricornia, held by government member Michelle Landry. Why is it that Ms Landry is not getting to announce government funding but instead Senator Hanson is getting to announce that funding? In the article in the Morning Bulletin, Senator Hanson claimed that she had been the only federal representative to make representations to the government for this hospice, which again begs the question: what is Ms Landry doing? She's not making representations for this funding. She's not getting to announce this funding. Instead, it's Senator Hanson who's getting to announce this funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson claimed that her efforts and her funding announcement came as a result of discussions that she had had with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Again, this raises the question: why is Senator Hanson getting to announce $8 million of federal government funding? Is this part of some deal that she has with the federal government? We know that Senator Hanson is the most reliable ally that the LNP has in this chamber, voting with them almost every single time. Is this what she gets in returnâ€”the ability to go out and announce government funding, instead of the government's own members?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue became even stranger yesterday, when a media release appeared on Michelle Landry's website claiming that she had delivered the funding. Two days after it was reported in the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin that Senator Hanson delivered the funding, now Michelle Landry is claiming the funding. There are only two options here: either Senator Hanson is lying, or Michelle Landry is being sold out by her own government.</span>

In doing so, I acknowledge the work done by so many to make this possible and the millions of Australians who have already been vaccinated, protecting themselves, their families and their community. Based on numbers released yesterday, more than 19 million vaccine doses have been administered nationally, growing by around a million doses every three days. This means that one in two Australians over 50 and one in three over 16 are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Australians are being vaccinated at a faster rate than was ever achieved in the United Kingdom, in the United States or across Europe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia has been fortunate during this pandemic to date, enjoying freedoms that many other Australians have not been able to enjoy, but we must not allow this fortunate position to become complacency or rely only on the defence of our border. As we started the week, WA's vaccination rate was lagging behind those of other states and territories, with 49.8 per cent having received their first dose and just 31 per cent their second.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meeting WA's vaccination targets is an important part of the Morrison government's national plan, which will minimise lockdowns and pave a safe path to reopening both WA and Australiaâ€”opening up to each other and to the entire world. So I strongly encourage everybody in Western Australia who has not yet taken steps to get vaccinated to please do so. Now is the time. As patron senator for Perth's northern suburbs, the Kimberley and the Pilbara, I particularly encourage locals there to book their vaccinations now, and I ask members of the many multicultural groups with which I work closely and which contribute so much to our wonderful Western Australian community to do the same. To those who have already been vaccinated, we say thank you. Your local community, your local businesses and your country also say thank you. Now is the time to vaccinate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  [by video link] On Friday, in evidence to the job security Senate inquiry, labour hire companies, including Hays, gave evidence that 2,500 staff contracted in the Australian Public Service have no access to paid leave for time spent isolating or being vaccinated for COVID-19. This is despite the fact that many of these staff do exactly the same job as their directly hired colleagues, who are entitled to this leave. What's more, I later heard from an APS worker, on a different labour hire contract, who said she did receive vaccination leave. So it's not even as though it's impossible for labour hire firms to do it; it's just that they are allowed by the government to get away with not bothering to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says it's not its responsibility to keep labour hire workers safe from COVID. This kind of two-tiered system is becoming endemic in Australia, and it's unacceptable that it should be allowed to operate within Scott Morrison's own government departments. It's this sort of evidence that led to Mr Morrison teaming up with One Nation to axe the job security inquiry last week. Mr Morrison knows that Australia's industrial relations system is broken, and he wants to muzzle the voices of workers experiencing severe job insecurity. Hays received $380 million from the federal government last yearâ€”that's $380 million of taxpayer moneyâ€”and yet they can't afford to stump up for COVID vaccination leave.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also revealed at the inquiry on Friday was the fact that no-one is even keeping track of how many APS staff are engaged on a temporary basis. There's no central record keeping or reporting of numbers, so not even the government knows what proportion of its own staff are casual at any given time.</span>

I wanted to raise this issue today in the Senate because, while it's not surprising that Australia's billionaire buffoon is again carpet-bombing this country with his millions of dollars to try to influence an election, what is critical about this is that, unfortunately, the Spam Act in Australia doesn't safeguard against false information if the message is authorised by a registered political party.

Is the minister aware that today the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed that the gap between the first and second doses of Pfizer vaccine in Sydney will be spaced out to eight weeks? Mr Hazzard said: 'Simply put, there is not enough Pfizer in New South Wales, or anywhere in the two major states, New South Wales or Victoria, for the people who are now wanting it.' Will the minister acknowledge, today's announcement is not enough to fix this?</span>

As of yesterday, there were about 58,000 aged-care workers in Australia yet to be vaccinated. Last week, we vaccinated over 22,000 of them. We've been vaccinating about 20-odd thousand a week. We offered, last week, 35,000 opportunities, and we'll offer, this week, 28,000 opportunities for aged-care workers, through our range of programsâ€”specific aged-care opportunities for vaccination. So we're working extremely hard with the providersâ€”and with the union movement, in fact, who my department meets with twice a week and I meet with every Friday to discuss the rollout and the issues relating to the aged-care workforce rollout. So we are determined to get the aged-care workforce vaccinated. We are atâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are currently running vaccination rates on a per capita basis that are as good as, or better than, any place in the worldâ€”the UK, the US. Yes, we did have some problems with the vaccination rollout early. We've acknowledged that. We have been straight with the Australian people. We haven't been trying to undermine public confidence in the vaccine rollout, like Labor have. We have continued to work to support supply of vaccine for the Australian people. We've done deals where we could to gain access to additional capacity, and we've provided that information to the Australian people. It's clear to the Australian people, even if it's not clear to the Australian Labor Party, that vaccination is important. Take the opportunity to go and get a vaccine. The best vaccine is the one that's available to you right now.</span>

As announced today by the Prime Minister, particularly in relation to Singapore, through our diplomatic channels with Singapore, and previously with Poland, the government has been able to secure access to 1.5 million vaccine doses this month. Earlier today, the Prime Minister, the health minister and I announced that Australia will receive 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from Singapore under a dose-sharing arrangement. We will, in turn, deliver 500,000 Pfizer doses to Singapore in December, when those supplies are available. It is a constructive and flexible way for governments to work together in all of our interests to manage COVID-19. I particularly want to thank Prime Minister Lee, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and the people of Singapore, and I acknowledge the work of Australia's High Commissioner Will Hodgman and his team, who have worked closely with the government of Singapore to achieve this outcome.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, we announced our agreement to receive one million Pfizer vaccines from Poland. These additional doses came on top of the 40 million Pfizer doses that Australia has secured for 2021, and that does provide a boost to the vaccine rollout across the country. It does also demonstrate the value of Australia's close engagement with other governments, and it's a strong example of countries cooperating and supporting one another, as we face the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic together and across the Indo-Pacific in particular. It also reinforces the role that my department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, plays in supporting Australia's response to, and recovery from, COVID-19. We are cooperating with our partners in the regionâ€”cooperating to save lives, to advance economic recovery and to build health systems to protect against future pandemics.</span>

At the G7 in June, Prime Minister Morrison committed to the delivery of at least 20 million vaccine doses from Australia's domestic supply to our region by mid-2022. We have already delivered over 2.1 million vaccine doses to the Pacific and South-East Asia, as well as that vital end-to-end support for those doses to be administered where they are needed most. The delivery of 403,000 doses to Vietnam last week was the first of a number to our South-East Asian partners. We've also committed 2Â½ million doses to our partners in Indonesia, and we'll begin delivery of those soon. We're working in partnership with our neighbours to support comprehensive vaccination of the Pacific and Timor-Leste. At this point in time, we've delivered 861,000 vaccine doses to Fiji; 577,850 doses to Timor-Leste; as I said, 403,000 to Vietnam; and further doses, of course, to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu andâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The impacts of COVID-19 continue to be very significant. The damage to economies and to communities in our region is severe. We've committed $130 million to the COVAX AMC, which has been delivering vaccines to the region since February. Our neighbours in South-East Asia and the Pacific have now received more than 48 million COVAX doses, with more deliveries planned. In addition, Australia has contributed $100 million to the Quad Vaccine Partnership that's directed to vaccine procurement for the region and support for national vaccine rollouts. We are working with our partners to support these countries within their national plans, on their priorities, and delivering in those partnerships in that manner.</span>

Clearly in New South Wales the situation is extremely difficult. The New South Wales government has placed significant lockdowns on large proportions of the New South Wales community and across all of New South Wales in an attempt to manage the current outbreak and suppress the spread of the virus. Suppression of the spread of the virus has been part of the national strategy on COVID-19 since the outset of the pandemic in 2020.</span>

I am certain that they will continue to do that. They provide very valuable information and advice with respect to the management of the pandemic and, through national cabinet, the states and the territories are working together with respect to the management of the virus and the pandemic across the country. We'll continue to do that: to take the advice that's been provided to us by the professionals who are leading the pandemic response and continue to work with them on managing the particular outbreaks in all the jurisdictions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This year, during the outbreak that's occurring in New South Wales, that fatality rate has dropped by close to 90 per cent, down to 0.45 per cent.

Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues to ramp up, as we said it would. More than 19.3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in Australia. Over the weekend, around 380,000 people rolled up their sleeves and got a jab to protect themselves, their friends and their families and to protect their country. Yesterday, a further 277,000 doses went into arms of Australians. I thank every single one of those people for going out and getting vaccinated, and I encourage all Australians to do the same.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While your home state of Western Australia, Senator Brockman, has very low COVID infections, the vaccine rollout is forging ahead in Western Australia too so that, when the time comes, WA can join all the states and reopen to the rest of the country and to the world, which is going to be very important for us all. We've got on with the job of protecting our most vulnerable Australians, with our older citizens first. More than 87 per cent of over-70s are protected with a first dose. We have done this because we know that elimination of the virus is a fallacy and that vaccines are the answer to us living with the virus, not in fear of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a national plan that states and territories have agreed on to open up at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates progressively. If we don't stick to the plan, the cost in terms of lives and livelihoods, as we're hearing right now, will be unacceptably high. Jobs will be lost; businesses will close.</span>

National cabinet agreed that the COVID-19 vaccination of residential workers would become mandatory by mid-September. The Department of Health has been working with each residential aged-care facility to ensure they have plans in place and provide support where needed to ensure that every residential aged-care worker has access to the COVID-19 vaccination. There are a number of channels open to them to get vaccinated, including the government's inreach services, vaccinating their own staff, and using Commonwealth and state vaccination clinics, GPs, and around 3,000 pharmacies across the country. We are determined to get this done.</span>

The Australian government is making rapid antigen tests available to residential aged-care and home-care services delivered through the Commonwealth Home Support Program in high-risk local government areas of concern across Sydney and western New South Wales. Rapid antigen testing is not an alternative to vaccination, but it does provide an extra layer of defence in that it helps to detect COVID-19 in people without any symptoms of COVID-19. Applications are open and remain open to receive rapid antigen test kits. To date orders have been dispatched to 128 sites in Sydney and New South Wales. Kits will be distributed under the National Medical Stockpile arrangements. The TGA has published guidance, including a checklist, to help businesses with the implementation of COVID-19 rapid antigen point-of-care testing in the workforce.</span>

As of today, 216,724 Indigenous peoples, or 37 per cent, have had their first dose and 20.5 per cent, or 118,886, have had their second dose. The numbers aren't high enough. We need to continue to work on this. We've done that through a number of programs. We have sought out influencers to support vaccination in those communities. Unfortunately, there have been some very influential voices that have been anti vaccine in some of those communities. We have to turn those attitudes around, and we will continue to do that in support of getting not just Indigenous Australians vaccinated but all Australians vaccinated because we know that that's our path through the pandemic.</span>

The National Summit on Women's Safety is an absolutely critical step in the development of the next National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and Their Children. It will be an ambitious blueprint to stop the scourge that is family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia. The plan will respond to urgent new issues that we are facing today and build a base for emerging and evolving issues in the future.</span>

Through an online platform it will bring together experts, survivors, advocates and service providers from locations all around Australia. Panels and presentations will be live streamed to enable Australians to engage in this very important milestone in our work towards developing the next national plan. The summit will cover a very broad range of issues, including economic security and financial independence, e-safety, perpetrator interventions and responding to sexual violenceâ€”to name but a few. It's the culmination of extensive consultations and will allow a diverse range of delegates to build a foundation in shaping our next national plan. </span>

We are absolutely committed to work towards a target of zero, to ensure all Australians are safe in their homes, safe at work and safe in our communities. The live stream will be available to watch on 6 and 7 September via womenssafetysummit.com.au. I encourage absolutely everyone who wants to have their say on the next national plan to engage with this very, very important milestone.</span>

Through the summit, panels are being held to bring together a cross-section of views from survivors, the service sector, academics and other experts to discuss existing issues and to delve into the new and emerging issues we are starting to see.</span>

Early interventions are absolutely essential if we are to reduce violence. That's why perpetrator programs are such an important part of our response. It is absolutely unacceptable that, in Australia, around 50 per cent of perpetrators will commit a further domestic violence offence within four years of their initial offence.</span>

Senator, rapid antigen testing kits for COVID-19 are going to be a fact of life for many of us in the next stage of this pandemic. From Monday, unvaccinated people in Sydney will need to take them before they can go to work. I reckon a lot of us will be going the same way eventually. The tests aren't as accurate as lab tests, but they give you a quick answer in 20 minutes and they're just a swab up the noseâ€”easy enough to do on your own. Senator, does your government understand how important rapid tests will be for us in the next few months?</span>

I think it's an important one. There are, I think, over 20 different types of rapid antigen tests that are approved for use in Australia through the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and I know that a lot of businesses are already looking at their utilisation as part of the way that they manage COVID-19 and protect themselves and their workforce from it as we go forward.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />As you might have heard earlier in question time today, I indicated that we have commenced a process of rolling out rapid antigen tests from the national stockpile to aged-care providers in metropolitan Sydney and regional areas of New South Wales, where COVID is a concern. It is a simple way to get some indication, in a short time frame, of whether or not there is a worker who might have an infection of COVID-19. Senator Lambie, you were right when you mentioned that they don't have the same efficacy as the PCR test, which is being utilised more broadly across the community, but I think they can and will play a role in the management of COVID-19. That's why we're rolling them out through residential aged careâ€”you can get an indication of whether somebody might be carrying the virus before they go to work. That's why business and industry are utilising them already. Even someone who's vaccinated can be carrying and transmitting the virus, so these provide an additional layer of protection to us all as part of our management of COVID-19. As I said, there are over 20 different types of rapid antigen tests that are currently approved, with very good guidelines on the TGA websiteâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

You can take it home and get an answer in 20 minutes. But in Australia, for some reason, we can do the test only if we're supervised by a trained health official, and we have to pay for it ourselves. Is there a reason why the coalition doesn't trust Australians to chuck a swab up our noses?</span>

One of the things that's a very important part of our overall management of COVID-19 is our test, track and trace capabilities. We saw in Victoria last year how important it was, and we see what's happening in other jurisdictions around the country now, where significant effort is being undertaken by states and territories in their testing regimes, their tracking and tracing, and their isolation of the virus. They all play a very important part in that process. You made the point yourself, Senator Lambie, when you talked about the fact that these tests aren't as accurate as the PCR tests that we're using in the broader process. We support the use of these tests under the conditions of approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and supported by the backup of a PCR test if there's an indicator, which is very important.</span>

He says that forcing employers to pay for tests so they can get their workers on site is putting a tax on jobs. I reckon he's right. Why are we so far behind once again, and when will free rapid tests be available for every worker who needs one?</span>

As I've indicated, we are supporting residential aged-care providers in New South Wales with the provision of rapid antigen tests. Over 120 facilities have already received tests and have started the process. In circumstances where it is warranted we are already providing that level of support, which I think is important, and we'll continue to do that. It's an extra layer of protection for those businesses where we're looking after our most vulnerable. In Tokyo I saw they had over 600,000 types of rapid antigen tests applied throughout the Olympic Games to support the running of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The tests can form an important part of the overall management and testing regime that occurs in the country, but they need to be supported by the efficacy of a PCR test.</span>

There was a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander management plan for novel coronavirus approved on 26 March last year. The implementation of the plan for the vaccine program and for Torres Strait Islander people was finalised on 9 March this year. So we have prioritised Indigenous Australians as part of the program.

We have provided significant assets and resources, including ventilators, to ensure that they were available in the circumstance that they were needed. In fact, we're been able to gather so many ventilators that we've actually been able to provide them to some of our regional neighbours who didn't have them. So I reject the premise that we haven't worked to put the systems in place and the relationships in place to support Australians through the health system.</span>

In fact, it's a very important day today for all superannuation members and Australia's future retirees, because today the outcomes of the first annual performance test for MySuper products have been published on the YourSuper comparison tool on the ATO website. This performance test reveals that $56.2 billion of Australians' retirement funds is invested in underperforming products, and these products are held in almost 1.1 million separate accounts. The test assessed the performance of over 80 MySuper products and found 13 of them underperformed, and, as we predicted, it is a mixture of retail, industry and corporate funds that have underperformed.</span>

That, to put it in context, is bigger than GDP, it is bigger than the ASX and it has doubled in size since the coalition came to government. Reports of superannuation's death have been greatly exaggerated by those opposite. Back when we came to government, we inherited a system riddled with flaws that meant super wasn't delivering on its promise to the 16 million workers and retirees who rely upon it. Since then, the Morrison government has been chipping away at those inefficiencies. We're eliminating the unintended multiple accounts that you allowed to proliferate. We are reuniting lost and inactive and low-balance accounts with their rightful owners. We've banned exit fees. We've capped fees on low balances. We've removed unnecessary insurance premiums particularly for young people who do not need them, and we've empowered all Australians to choose their fundâ€”something you have denied them for years and years.</span>

This doesn't just impact those who have COVID-19; it affects anyone suffering from life-threatening illness and injury, as the finite resources of their healthcare system are stretched to the breaking point. It is a fate that is too difficult to contemplate for my home state, yet we are seeing the tell-tale signs of a system on the brink of disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, Westmead Hospital and Blacktown hospital stopped accepting COVID patients, forcing paramedics to ramp up with patients on board. It has been reported that overworked Sydney ICU nurses are now sedating patients to manage what they describe as 'hellhole conditions'. Another 1,164 cases in the state today will only add to this strain. We are 18 months into this pandemic. We are six months into this vaccine rollout, and yet it's never looked more dire. Never has this minister looked so out of touch. Everything, according to him, is going just fine. He is patting himself on the back for failing to meet the targets the government set, leaving New South Wales, Indigenous people, and aged-care workers behindâ€”leaving Australians behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, this Prime Minister claimed that the vaccine rollout wasn't a race. Look where we are now. As usual with Mr Morrison, it's always somebody else's fault. Make no mistake: what we are seeing in New South Wales today is the direct result of the failures of the Morrison government. A proper hotel quarantine system would mean that we didn't have leakages. Hotels are for tourists. They are not for quarantine. Under Mr Morrison, we have seen 27 leakages which have led to illness and death across the country. The outbreak that we are currently experiencing in New South Wales was something that Jane Halton warned the Prime Minister about last yearâ€”the transport system causing a leak in the quarantine system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, the 27 leakages I am talking about don't even include the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> debacle, which we heard the Inspector-General of Biosecurity say this week was a failure of federal officialsâ€”agriculture department officialsâ€”who didn't check the traveller-with-illness checklist, didn't review the ship's medical logs and didn't warn New South Wales Health that COVID was rampant on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. That means they failed to stop the one boat that mattered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we had a proper vaccine rollout, we'd have a safe and speedy rollout of jabs in arms. Remember, four million of us were supposed to be vaccinated by May. All of us were supposed to be vaccinated by October. That's not going to happen. It is always too little, too late. It is vulnerable communities that are being left behind. We are now hearing doctors, like Dr Peter Malouf in New South Wales, labelling the vaccine rollout in Indigenous communities a 'chaotic crisis'. The Morrison government's response to COVID-19 must be seen as one of the most catastrophic public policy failures of any government in the history of our nation. We have the New South Wales minister Brad Hazzard pointing the finger at the federal government. We have the New South Wales Deputy Premier, John Barilaro, pointing the finger at the failures of the Morrison government. The problem we have here is not that people have vaccine hesitancy; it's just that we have a Prime Minister who has apathyâ€”he's too little, too late. It's always somebody else's fault, and it's the Australian people who are being left behind to suffer the consequences.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  What we have just seen from the deputy leader of the opposition in this place shows exactly why the Labor Party lack the credentials to lead this country. The panicked pantomime that we just saw from Senator Keneally is exactly what the Australian people do not want now, at a time of difficulty and crisis. This is a very difficult time for our country. It's a very difficult time for the world, to be tackling a pandemic. But what people want in a pandemic is not panic; they want calm. What people need during a pandemic is not gross exaggeration; they want us to be steely and stoic, deal with the situation and come up with solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Keneally and the other Labor senators today quoted from the New South Wales government extensively in their questions, but they failed to quote the Premier on the very topic that Senator Keneally just spent her time talking about. Senator Keneally is in this place spreading panic through our land, suggesting that somehow our hospitals may within hours or within days be completely overcrowded and have no ability to take people. That is completely untrue, and, if she were seriously looking at the statements from the New South Wales government, she would know it is untrue. But she has been cherrypicking her statements for political interest, rather than providing the professional, calm leadership that is required at a time like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Premier of New South Wales, Premier Berejiklian, was quoted just the other dayâ€”this was an article from just four days agoâ€”as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have been ready for additional ICU patients for a long time â€¦ We have always had those contingency plans, but what is confronting for us is when you have a network that has great staff, is seeing more patients, it does stretch things and it does mean things are done differently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's exactly what the Australian people need: calm leadership, saying, 'We will respond to this. We will tackle it.' I don't know if Senator Keneally has spoken to her own local health authorities. I've been in constant contact with mine in Central Queensland since the start of this pandemic, and I know that they expanded their ICU capabilities very early on. They've always had plans in place to do that. In fact, there was a detailed paper published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">edical Journal of Australia</span> last year which showed the ability of our great health system, our fantastic health system, to respond. In that paper, a variety of professionals went across the country, and I believe they spoke to 191 ICU units across Australia. At the start of the pandemic, we had 2,378 intensive care beds. What this study found was that, very quickly, we could add another 4,258 intensive care beds if required, because we have a great health system full of great health professionals. I think Senator Keneally does our health professionals a great disservice when she seems to question their ability to respond. I have great faith in them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to focus on now is coming up with the solutions to support our health professionals and support Australians in this pandemic, not unnecessarily panic everybody throughout the land and further contribute to the stress and strain that is on many Australians, especially those going through lockdown right now. We would, of course, all love to return to a place where we have zero COVID casesâ€”it was wonderful; it was greatâ€”but we do live in the real world here, and it seems to me that Senator Keneally and her colleagues on the Labor side want to be the government of Disneyland, not the government of Australia. The only place where zero COVID cases will exist now is in a fantasy land, in a Disneyland. We are not going back to that state of affairs. That is the reality. In fact, even the Victorian Premier today recognised that when he said that he will look at easing restrictions even before Victoria gets back to zero cases. Apparently, in the next few days he will outline some steps where, even with positive cases, restrictions will be eased. That is a sensible approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are playing catch-up. They are holding onto a fantasy that we can no longer deliver. What our job should be, as leaders, as people in this country in positions of authority, is to level with the Australian people and tell them the truth, not spread panic and fairytales that will never be able to be implemented. This government, along with the state and territory governments, is responding professionally to this crisis. We need to have a map out of this so we can let people out of their homes, let people get back to work, and deal with this pandemic in the best way we can, with the wonderful health system we have in this nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  When Mr Morrison decided to take a gamble on hotel quarantine and vaccines last year, he set in place a series of events that led us to exactly where we are today, and it didn't have to be this way. A Prime Minister who was more interested in leading rather than reducing vectors of political exposure would have actually fixed our quarantine system and would have taken responsibility for securing more types and greater numbers of vaccines. Instead, we have a Prime Minister who found time to research his family tree during a trip overseas, while thousands of Australians remained stranded with no way home. The consequences of Mr Morrison's decisions are becoming clearer by the day. In the last 48 hours, we have had significant numbers of health personnel speaking out, despite the fact that their employment contracts actually make this personally risky for them. They have chosen to speak out about the pressures they are under and about their fears for the health system. These are people on the front line of the pandemic and the government should listen to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan is rightâ€”a government should level with its people. Nothing about the current approach suggests to me that the government is levelling with its people, because it's not willing to engage with the questions that are being raised from the very people whose daily responsibility is to protect and care for sick people in New South Wales. Nurses, paramedics and doctors are blowing the whistle on the challenges ahead. A Sydney nurse said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are exhausted. Last night was brutal. We literally hit capacity â€¦ Just holding on. The patients are air-hungry, starving for breath â€¦We simply don't have enough of us. We are on the edge now â€¦We have been trying to warn the government for a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The union that represents these workers has said it's becoming increasingly concerned that Australia's public hospitals will not be able to cope with the growing demand if we allow COVID to take hold before we're truly prepared. And that's the key, isn't it? Yes, we want to get out of lockdown, but it needs to be safe, and a safe emergence from this pandemic requires careful planning and consideration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we heard the tragic news of the first Indigenous COVID death in Australia, a 50-year-old, a much-loved grand-uncle. He got to see his grandchild just once. He wasn't vaccinated. Aboriginal health services workers, advocates and community members have been warning the government for months and months that this was a possibility, but these warnings have been ignored. The New South Wales Deputy Premier, Mr Barilaro, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We know that the federal government's vaccination program at the start of the year identified the Indigenous communities in part of the 1A rollout, and it hasn't occurred â€¦ and that's something that they lost attention on, and we know earlier in the year the rollout wasn't anywhere near where it needed to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PM promised that First Nations communities would be fully vaccinated by winter, but the reality is that just eight per cent of First Nations people in western New South Wales are fully vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to take responsibility for that and to develop a plan to remedy it, because the government has bungled this vaccination rollout. We are a very long way from the 70 per cent thresholdâ€”or the 80 per cent threshold. Yes, people are looking for a safe pathway to resume something like normal life; people are desperate for it. But it all depends on having a serious plan to manage the pandemic. Frankly, Mr Morrison has bungled every opportunity presented to him to lead through this pandemic. He stood by while the crisis raged through nursing homes in Victoriaâ€”a sector that is regulated and controlled by the Commonwealthâ€”refusing to take responsibility, shunting responsibility onto the state government. He failed to procure enough vaccines and a diverse range of contracts. That left the Australian community dangerously exposed to delta, with less than a quarter of Australians fully vaccinated when the second wave brutally started sweeping through our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see absolutely no sign that he's now ready to roll up his sleeves and tackle this next crisis. What he would prefer, of course, as always, is a political approachâ€”just pick fights with state premiers, distract, divert and wait until the news cycle moves on. Well, a pandemic doesn't move on. And real leaders do offer calm, considered leadership. That involves talking to people, not harassing them and nitpicking. It involves actually engaging the state premiers to make this federation pandemic-ready. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I'm glad to rise today to speak on this motion to take note of answers. In particular, I'd like to just remind Senator Keneally of the boats, because, when the Labor Party was last in power, over 1,200 people died at sea in the boats by something that was totally brought on by the Labor Party. Compare that with the number of people who died with COVID, which is only just past 1,000, and a lot of those had co-morbidities. I can assure you that the Morrison government didn't design COVID, unlike the boat crisis that was designed by the Labor Party and was totally self-inflicted. So it's a bit rich for them to come in here and play games and accuse the Morrison government of causing deaths in a situation which was basically out of their control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the lowest COVID death rates in the world, and we've actually got one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. It's worth noting that this year we've had fewer than 100 COVID deaths out of over 20,000 cases. That is a case fatality rate of 0.04 per cent, or fewer than four people out of every 1,000 cases. Compare that with the number of deaths in 2019, when Australia had 170,000 deaths out of 25 million people. That was a death rate of seven people out of 1,000. The COVID fatality rate is just around half of the overall fatality rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the vaccine rollout. We've now basically got 86 per cent of over-70-year-olds first-dosed and over 63 per cent of over-70-year-olds second-dosed. I get a little bit sick and tired of hearing the Labor Party talk about AstraZeneca and Pfizer as though it's a competition. The fact of the matter is that last Augustâ€”when, as Labor love to claim, we could've bought 40 million dosesâ€”the Pfizer vaccine hadn't even been approved for safety. It hadn't even been proved that it actually worked. It's a completely new technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly enough, the World Health Organization came out in September last year and said that it wouldn't be until mid-2021 that the Pfizer vaccine was going to be ready. Another point to note is that the Pfizer vaccine has to be refrigerated and stored at negative 70 degrees. The Morrison coalition government had to make a decision back then. They went with the AstraZeneca vaccine as its main supplier because they could get it produced here in Australia. They could get it produced here in Australia by none other than CSL. To remind people about the history of CSL, CSL used to be government owned. It was actually set up by the government in 1917 so that Australia would have its ownâ€”wait for itâ€”vaccine supplies. What happened? The Labor Party sold CSL. In the time since, it has got into blood transfusion and a lot of other products, but its core business of vaccine production has gone by the wayside. For Labor to come in here and claim that we haven't got enough vaccinesâ€”they ought to look in the mirror, because the damage was done right back in 1992 by a bloke named Paul Keating and one of his great advisers, Bill Bowtell. He's out there running around being an expert on everything, yet he was one of the advisers to Keating who allowed CSL to be sold. The hypocrisy is astounding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should also be noted that the US didn't even export Pfizer. The first country it exported Pfizer to was Mexico, on 29 April. The USA was exporting very few Pfizer vaccines. What seems to be overlooked in all of this is that it's not that easy to just go and conjure 50-odd million Pfizer vaccines at the drop of a hat, keep them stored at negative 70 degrees and get them rolled out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The vaccination program is well and truly on its way. It hasn't been helped by Queensland's Chief Health Officer, who's been there under a Labor government, who has been basically talking people out of getting the AstraZeneca vaccine. While she was saying this, she failed to disclose that her own husband used to consult to Pfizer. If that's not a conflict of interest I don't know what is. That type of behaviourâ€”while we're trying to encourage vaccine rolloutsâ€”hasn't helped anyone. It's about time Labor got on board and started to work in the interests of the Australian people, rather than whingeing and wailing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  [by video link] Well, that was quite mind-boggling. Quite clearly, when we first got into these vaccines there was a clear indication that it was a necessity to have a whole series of vaccines purchased on order so that, even with those that would fail and those that wouldn't follow through, we'd have enough for the Australian community. Of course, time has proven it. Epidemiologists told the government. Pfizer told the government, in direct conversations and indirect conversations. Yet the government has still failed to take responsibility for its mistake. This is not about looking backwards; I'm looking forwards. If they won't take responsibility for what they're doing wrong right now, how can people have the necessary confidence that this will be dealt with appropriately into the future?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have another 1,164 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases here in New South Wales. We have 871 in hospital and 143 in intensive care. People are suffering from the mental toll of months of lockdown, and small businesses are suffering dire economic hardship. It's important to remember that the reason we are in this situation is that the Prime Minister failed in his two most important jobs: to get the vaccine rollout right and to get a dedicated quarantine system up and running. Of course, we saw with the Bondi outbreak, with the limo driver driving international flight crew, that there were not appropriate safeguards at our border. That is a federal government responsibility, yet we hear repeatedly from the government that they should not be held to account for the mistakes and failings they have made and the ones they continue to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health system was already at breaking point before the Prime Minister's national plan, which, based on Doherty modelling, will put tens of thousands more Australians in hospital. There is no plan for how our medical system can handle that pressure and no serious plan to move forward. This rollout is quite clearly a failure, and the government needs to take responsibility. There's not enough Pfizer. There are delays. The New South Wales health minister made it clear when he blew the whistle on the silence of the federal government and their incompetence about Pfizer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the moment of truth was Senator Colbeck's response to a quote from an experienced respiratory physician in Western Sydney. I'll repeat this because I hope those listening to the Senate will be as outraged as I am that this question was not answered. 'With the coming deluge of cases, it is possible that ambulances will not reach people suffering heart attacks or strokes as quickly as they should,' said a Western Sydney doctor. Quite clearly the government needs to take responsibility and be able to deal appropriately and in a quick way with the sorts of pressures that are applied to our health system at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to have too much of an imagination, because you have the government turning around saying, 'It's not a race.' You don't have to have too much of an imagination to know we're in a crisis. The government says, 'It's not a race.' You don't have to have too much imagination to know that we have so many people suffering from COVID and the effect on business. Of course, it wasn't a race! This government continues to try to distract people by saying that the failure is the opposition's, which is just ironic, by raising the government's mistruths and failures. That is absolutely ludicrous. Take responsibility. I know that the Prime Minister won't do it. I say to the ministers and the government: take responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New South Wales, along with those pressures on services, has seen staff shortages, hospitals reaching ICU capacity and increased sedation of ICU patients in order to manage the burgeoning workload in the New South Wales COVID system. And 60,000 aged-care workers still aren't vaccinated. They say, 'Don't be alarmed.' I wish they were more alarmed. I wish they actually thought it was a race. It is a race to vaccinate by the deadline 60,000 aged-care workers. The Health Services Union National President, Gerard Hayes, appropriately said that the aged-care royal commission found in March the sector was facing a staffing crisis that risked being exacerbated by the pandemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Birmingham) to a question without notice asked by Senator Thorpe today relating to COVID-19 vaccination rates for First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister would not answer the question, which was: when will all First Nations peoples be vaccinated? He danced around it but he wouldn't say, because he can't say. The rollout for First Nations communities has been dismal. It is unconscionable. First Nations people were in either phase 1a or phase 1b. They are supposed to have been vaccinated by now. Yet here we've seen a First Nations man in Wilcannia pass away due to COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government knew that if COVID got into First Nations communities it would have a devastating impact. In fact, look at the time line. In March last year Maari Ma Aboriginal health corporation wrote to the Morrison government warning about COVID-19 outbreaks in western New South Wales. In July this year, NACCHO was excluded from the National COVID Vaccine Taskforce meeting. How did that happen, when everybody in Australia knows that First Nations communities are at such significant risk? How did it happen? In August 2018, we had elders calling for vaccine supplies, for nurses to support Aboriginal medical services and for appropriate accommodation so people could quarantine. What does the government do? It sends in the Army and the police. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter that was written by the Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation warned about the great risk because of overcrowded housing, food insecurity, a highly mobile population, low health literacy and issues around poor health and chronic disease. These were all things I'm sure the government knew about, but they reminded the government about them to put them high on the agenda. What do we see now? We see the disaster that's happening in western New South Wales. It is unconscionable that the Prime Minister has overseen this happening and that the government overrides First Nations' wishes. We should have First Nations peoples making these decisions. NACCHO is very clear in providing the advice. The Aboriginal health organisations are very clear that they need to be in the driving seat here, because First Nations peoples must have self-determination and control over this program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told that First Nations peoples are laughing at the messaging. It is so poor. You know how you make sure you get it right? You put it in the hands of First Nations organisations. It's not as if they haven't got their own media hubs. Many communities, in fact, have their own media hubs, and they know how to communicate with their own community. Enable them to do it. Enable communities to take control of the decision-making. But what have the government done? They've excluded them. They've excluded NACCHO from crucial meetings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to Senator Birmingham's non-answer on targets for when we will see all First Nations peoples vaccinated. NACCHO is calling for 100 per cent vaccination of First Nations peoples or as close as you can get, acknowledging that some people can't have a vaccination due to health reasons. But we need to make sure we're aiming for 100 per cent. When will we see that happen? The Minister representing the Prime Minister could not answer that question, when we know that First Nations people are so at risk. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Maari Ma wrote to the government, they suggested that accommodation such as motels and caravan parks could be used for quarantining. They saw, in March last year, the urgent need for these sorts of things to take place, knowing very well that we needed to make sure that there were safe places for people to go because of overcrowding. I won't take up the rest of the time talking about the appalling state of housing for First Nations peoples, because Australia knows about it. They also suggested ways to safeguard against food shortages, and we're hearing about that. We're hearing that people can't go out to make sure that they're adequately fed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now see that Wilcannia has the highest transmission rate in New South Wales. Shame on the New South Wales government and shame on the Morrison government that it has got to this point! They knew this could happen, and, unfortunately, it is happening now. It's a travesty that this is happening to First Nations communities, including in Wilcannia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Purpose of the Bill </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill confers a time-limited spending power on the Minister for Health for the purpose of purchasing additional COVID-19 vaccines, inclusive of boosters, and necessary consumables, and COVID-19 treatments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Cabinet would retain its role in consideration and decision of vaccines and related purchases, and following Cabinet decision, the Minister for Health would exercise the spending power under the new provision to enable payments to be made upon execution of Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine manufacturers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reasons for Urgency</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Bill is not passed before the end of the 2021 Spring sittings, there is a risk that necessary payments for shipments of life-saving COVIDâ€‘19 vaccines, particularly for the 2022 booster program, may not be able to be made in a timely manner, threatening supply schedules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The latest scientific evidence for vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, including the need for boosters, is always evolving and decisions on the need to purchase products do not align with the regular cycle of Appropriation Bills. This spending power would provide a mechanism for the Department of Health to meet these payments as they fall due, regardless of whether funding for specific products was included in the most recent Appropriation Bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While broad provisions of funding can be provided for future expenditure through Appropriation Bills, due to the unpredictable nature of the efficacy of products coming to market throughout this pandemic, it is important to have a flexible mechanism for the short-term while longer term approaches for vaccines are considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Effect if the Bill is not dealt with in one sitting period</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The need to be ready to rapidly invest in vaccines will continue as scientific evidence about future needs becomes clearer. At the same time, the international market for the purchase of vaccine is highly competitive. Without an adequate and certain pool of funds, the ability for Australia to negotiate the future purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, consumables and treatments may be hindered. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Why the need for the Bill was not foreseen</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">First doses of COVID-19 vaccines were delivered internationally in December 2020, while first doses were administered in Australia in late February 2021. The scientific evidence regarding COVID-19 vaccines continues to emerge at a rapid pace. The Australian Government already had in place Advance Purchase Agreements for sufficient vaccine doses for the entire population; however the need to purchase additional booster doses has only emerged in recent months. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Stakeholders and survivors are expecting the Government to respond quickly and meaningfully to the Review and this bill enables the Government to immediately implement a number of Scheme improvements.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, the bill introduces an advance payment of $10,000 for elderly and terminally ill applicants while they are waiting for their final redress outcome. Given the nature of institutional child sexual abuse, the Government is aware that survivors may not come forward to seek redress for some time and may be elderly or ill when they apply to the Scheme. There is a risk that survivors may pass away before receiving their redress outcome and any acknowledgement of the abuse they experienced as children. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I rise today in favour of the Federal Environment Watchdog Bill 2021, the Australian Greens' Bill which will establish a Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a global leader in wildlife extinction. Our natural environment and iconic places are in an overall state of decline and are under increasing threat. The current environmental trajectory is unsustainable. Our environment laws are failing to protect our wildlife and the Morrison Government not only has no intention of strengthening those laws, right now they want to weaken them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is shameful that Australia experiences some of the worst land clearing rates in the world and has been identified as a global deforestation hotspot by WWF International. And yet, the Morrison Government wants to make it even easier for mining companies and big developers to get approval for projects that will destroy the environment and harm our native animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Before the catastrophic climate fires over the 2019/20 summer, which saw 3 billion native animals killed or displaced, Australia already held the dishonour of worst mammalian extinction rate in the world, our wildlife was in crisis and needed urgent protection. But rather than do something to improve this dire situation for our wildlife and the environment, the Morrison Government ignored the recommendations of the once-in-ten-year statutory review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;">1999 </span>(EPBC Act), which reported later in 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reviewer, Professor Graeme Samuel AC was scathing in his findings and firm in his recommendations that the EPBC Act needed an overhaul to reverse the unsustainable trajectory our environment is on. He outlined a reform process that included strong environmental standards and an independent cop on the beat to enforce them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill would deliver the latter. Professor Samuel stated in his interim report that: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'The current collaborative approach to monitoring, compliance, enforcement and assurance is too weak. Serious enforcement actions are rarely used, indicating a limited regard for the benefits of using the full force of the law where it is warranted. When they are issued, penalties are not commensurate with the harm of damaging a public good of national interest. They do not provide an adequate deterrent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A strong, independent cop on the beat is required. An independent compliance and enforcement regulator, that is not subject to actual or implied political direction from the Commonwealth Minister, should be established. The regulator should be responsible for monitoring compliance, enforcement and assurance. It should be properly resourced and have available to it a full toolkit of powers.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of an independent Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority that operates at arm's-length from Government to conduct transparent environmental assessments and inquiries as well as undertake monitoring, compliance and enforcement actions, has the backing of environmental stakeholders like the Places You Love Alliance and many of the 30,000 submitters to the Samuel Review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Professor Samuel's recommendation followed a scathing assessment by the Auditor-General which found the environment department was failing to properly administer the EPBC Act including an absence of effective monitoring, reporting and evaluation arrangements for controlled actions. The Auditor-General's assessment of the government's management of the environment and our wildlife was scathing. The report shows the Environment Minister and the department have failed to protect the environment and are, simply put, incompetent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Heads should have rolled over this ineptitude and failure of duty. If this was the Health Minister who had overseen the botched implementation and enforcement of health and safety regulations, they and the head of their department would get the sack. The environment should be no different. The report shows, it's not just incompetency, it's a lack of care and duty that has allowed the trashing of the environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government is intent on putting the interests of miners and developers ahead of clean water, critical habitat and the survival of our native animals. The government cannot guarantee that not one more hectare of critical koala habitat will be lost under their plan. They cannot guarantee that not one more sacred Aboriginal site will be blown up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Enough is enough. There must be accountability, and it must be at the top. Not only do our environmental laws need an overhaul but clearly so does those who are in charge of administering them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While countries around the world are pledging zero extinction targets and to protect 30 per cent land and 30 per cent sea to achieve it, the Australian Government is watching extinction after extinction occur on its watch. We need a zero extinction target, we need to protect at least 30 per cent of our land and 30 per cent of our sea and we need strong environmental protections and an independent watchdog to hold governments, miners and developers to account if we are going to achieve those targets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we our natural places are not protected, the result will be more dead koalas, more pollution, more logging and more wanton destruction of environment and heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If environment protection agencies are good enough for our states, why do we still not have a federal agency when it is the Commonwealth that is responsible for assessing matters of national environmental significance. It defies logic that 20 years after the establishment of the EPBC Act there would be no independent enforcement of those laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without independence from the Minister and the political party they belong to, which is beholden to their political donors in the mining, development and logging industries our laws will never be upheld in the way they should. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To fail to enforce the laws is a death sentence for Australia's koalas and wildlife. The rest of the world is working out how to save the planet. Australia needs to join them with urgent action and this bill would be an enormous step. As Professor Samuel said, 'To shy away from the fundamental reforms recommended by this Review is to accept the continued decline of our iconic places and the extinction of our most threatened plants, animals and ecosystems'. There's no time to waste, the parliament should do what the government will not and implement this bill and the very sensible and important recommendation of the Samuel Review.</span>

The Energy Security Board is structurally independent of government and, under its terms of reference, only undertakes work at the direction of all energy ministers. The ESB's advice on the National Electricity Market post-2025 market design is the culmination of two years work and extensive consultation. Their proposed reforms have been warmly welcomed, including by the Australian Workers Union and CFMMEU Mining and Energy Division. The AWU has said that making the ESB's recommendations law is critical to securing Australia's manufacturing sector. The ESB estimates that these reforms could save consumers $1.3 billion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  This afternoon the MPI we're debating is the reported views of members of the New South Wales Liberal Party, including that they see the Prime Minister to be 'the Prime Minister for Morrison and no-one else'â€”the Prime Minister for himself. What a divided bunch the Liberal Party are! All of us here already knew that. We've all been around this building and seen some of the bickering and side glances, but who would have thought that the Premier of the state of New South Wales, a stalwart in the Liberal Party and in the New South Wales Liberal Partyâ€”just like the Prime Ministerâ€”would be in open revolt? There is very apparent mutiny in the ranks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 28 August published a piece entitled 'Even Gladys Berejiklian is fed up with PM, who she privately regards as "evil" and a "bully"'. I must say that when I heard that even I was taken aback. After all, I said just last week that the Prime Minister was the Prime Minister for New South Wales. But, frankly, not even the Premier of New South Wales wants him as his Prime Minister. It is no surprise to hear someone calling the Prime Minister a bullyâ€”it's almost synonymous with his name at this point in terms of the many debates we've had in this place regarding his characterâ€”but evil is something quite new. And it's coming from one of the most senior Liberals in Australia, the Premier of Australia's largest state. I find that damning, and I find that very worrying. The nation should be worried that senior Liberals describe the leader of their party and the leader of the government in this way. It's all very well to say, 'Yes, we take it with a pinch of salt,' when the opposition rails against the policies of a government, when we rail against the decisions of a government and when we rail against the incompetence of this government. But, for our Prime Minister's character to be impugned in this way in public debate and on the public record, yes, our country should be worried.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last year, we've heard the phrase from all over the country that the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister for Sydney, New South Wales, and nowhere else. He doesn't care about South Australians or Victorians. He called Queenslanders and Western Australians cave people. Now we're told by the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Sydney Morning Herald</span> that, among Premier Berejiklian's inner circle, the Prime Minister is considered a joke. It's a joke to consider the Prime Minister the Prime Minister for New South Wales, because New South Wales, in the inner circles, certainly doesn't regard him that way. They regard him as the Prime Minister for Morrison and no-one else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's break down why the Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, may think that the Liberal Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, is evil. We were told a few weeks ago that the Prime Minister's press office phoned political reporters backgrounding against Premier Berejiklian to try to push the pressure of a failing vaccination rate onto New South Wales, backgrounding against members of his own team. Our Prime Minister has certainly been feeling the heat. He and his government had failed to fulfil one of the two most crucial jobs this year, which is costing Australian lives. That job was vaccination and quarantine. But, like every other time our nation's Prime Minister has been put under pressure and held accountable, he crumbles and tries to shift the blame onto others. It's utterly pathetic. It's a low political tactic employed by those who can't stand behind their decisions and the consequences of their decisions. It is a tactic that our Prime Minister has employed over and over again, to background against people, undermine them and impugn their character. Prime Minister Morrison's attempt to shift blame onto Premier Berejiklian for the failed vaccination rollout could be one reason Premier Berejiklian might have for calling the Prime Minister evil.</span>

                  </a>  This is not the first time the Prime Minister's staff have been accused of backgrounding against Premier Berejiklian and many other people. They were seen to be backgrounding against the Premier during the horrific New South Wales bushfires some two years ago. I think this is utterly shameless. We even have a quote from one of Premier Berejiklian's loyalists saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then went on to say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the actions of every awful male manager you have ever had: shirking responsibility, pushing the blame onto others and trying to steal the success of others who are just trying to competently do their own job. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that that awful relationship management is perhaps why Queensland Premier Palaszczuk decided to dump Morrison's failed hotel quarantine system and instead build dedicated cabin facilities. Queensland needed to go ahead and do it because the Prime Minister wouldn't take responsibility for it. They didn't go through Prime Minister Morrison, and I guess it may be the same for Premier Berejiklian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it all works then the Prime Minister will walk away with the gloryâ€”it's the PM's doing. If it fails, without a doubt our Prime Minister will always seek to blame someone else: the premiers of the states. This is completely unacceptable behaviour for a national leader. I have to say I can only assume that those senators opposite must feel a sense of shame in having to put up with this circus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for Western Australia, I can tell you right now that the Prime Minister is winning no friends in my home state. Alongside the outrageous 'cave people' comment from last week, we now have the Prime Minister undermining Premier McGowan. The Premier who has been doing his best to keep Australians safe and healthy is being undermined by a two-bit Prime Minister who is trying to deflect the blame. We are witnessing before our eyes the breakdown of the national cabinet system, and it is the Prime Minister's fault. He can't run from this one and he can't shift the blame. New South Wales thinks the Prime Minister isâ€”I can't quote it, but we heard it in the news. Queensland is just getting on with the job without him, and WA is doing its utter best to keep Western Australians safe in the face of a Prime Minister who desperately wants to drag Western Australia into the COVID disaster gripping Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of grave public interest that this Prime Minister starts cooperating with the states and working in the interests of all Australians. This should mean no more backgrounding when the going gets tough, no more blaming and blame-shifting from the Prime Ministerâ€”from those in the top job and around himâ€”no seeking glory when it is undeserved and no more undermining of premiers like Mark McGowan, who I'm proud to say has done a very good job keeping Western Australia one of the safest places in the world during this pandemic. I know that we all face risks and that it could happen to any state at any time, but I have to say that Western Australia has done more than most and certainly more than New South Wales to keep itself safe.</span>

I will read for those opposite, though, some information around the funding of WA hospitals, because this Prime Minister is for all Australians. Even when Labor state premiers fail to support their own states, the Commonwealth, under the Prime Minister, is there to ensure that the citizens of Western Australia are best supported. What we know is that funding from the Commonwealth for hospitals in WA has increased by 72.8 per cent. I'm sorry Senator Pratt is not staying to listen to this.

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. They're feisty today. As I was saying, over the same period, the funding from the WA state governmentâ€”you know, under the federation, those guys that are actually responsible for funding hospitalsâ€”increased by 18 per cent. So, while the Commonwealth has increased its funding by over 72 per cent, the WA state governmentâ€”which, let's face it, is pretty much on its own. We know you guys won pretty big over there, so there's no-one else you can really blame. We are now increasing the funding by approximately four times that of the state government. I honestly hope for the people in WA that someone within the WA government starts to pay attention to that, because their hospitals are currently at the highest level of alert without a single case of COVID. So, if people would be concerned, I wouldn't be casting aspersions from WA about how fantastic they are when it comes to COVID and COVID management. Of course, the Prime Minister of all Australiansâ€”even the ones who have incompetent premiers incapable of funding the services they're supposed to be responsible forâ€”the Commonwealth, through this Prime Minister, is ensuring that those citizens are protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That isn't actually where I wanted to start today. I just thought it was important that we got bit of clarity out there on who is actually looking after all Australians. Unlike many people in this place, I've actually known the Prime Minister personally for nearly 20 years, and he is an absolutely fantastic leader. I got to know him when he was State Director of the New South Wales Liberal Party. That was when we were working on the 2004 campaign. Those opposite might remember it, through you, Acting Deputy President: Medicare Gold. Remember that one? That was a cracker. We had the Mark Latham handshake, and we had Mr Howard being mobbed by loggers in Tasmania, as they were so grateful for the support that the Howard government was giving them, as opposed to what Mr Latham wanted to subject them to. Mr Morrison, when he was Mr Morrison, State Director of the New South Wales Liberal Party, was an absolutely fantastic leader and a great campaignerâ€”a fantastic campaignerâ€”and someone who it was an absolute privilege to work with. I would like to say: actually, because of the Prime Minister, the thought of massaman curry just turns my stomach since that campaign. I have never seen anyone who could order curry literally every night over a six-week campaign, consistently. It really was something to behold. It's probably his biggest flaw: his embracing of curry in so many flavours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought that, for those opposite, we might have a little talk about the actual achievements of this government and how they have delivered for Australians across the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know you sneer; those opposite love to smear and sneer and carry on when the Prime Minister talks about team Australia. Well, that's because those opposite aren't on it. The only team they're on is the team of the union bosses, who make sure they do exactly as they're told. Those opposite are not interested in helping to fight for small businesses. In fact, they're not even interested in large businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You pretend, those oppositeâ€”through you, Acting Deputy Presidentâ€”that you're interested in jobs. No; you're not interested in jobs. You're only interested in the job the government pays for. You're not interested in the jobs that are created by Australian innovation. You're not interested in the jobs that are created by Australian companies. You're not interested in those businesses that employ the vast majority of Australiansâ€”and those vast majority of Australians are still connected to their workplaces, even with the current situation that we're seeing in the ACT, New South Wales and Victoria. These people are still connected to their jobs, and that's because of the introduction of JobKeeper, and that kept them together, and they were there, but it was never a permanent solution. Those opposite were claiming we'd fall off the economic cliff, but guess what? Some people actually paid attention in economics class, and that did not happen. What we're actually seeing now is that we have more Australians in work than we did before the pandemic. We have more women in the workforce than we did before the pandemic started. In fact, we're the first advanced economy to have reached that milestone. We're faster than the US and faster than the UK. None of them can claim the same sort of economic victory over COVID that was experienced by Australiansâ€”all Australians!â€”last year, led by this Prime Minister.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the 3.4 million small businesses that are receiving tax relief all across this country. These are everyday Australians who've set up their own small business and employ fellow Australians. They are being supported through tax relief, but we know you guys on the other side don't like tax relief. It was all about $387 billion of taxes at the last election. I just wonder whether, when the current opposition leader finally faces up to the member for Maribyrnong, they'll be bringing those taxes back. I've yet to hear the former opposition leader say to the current opposition leader that he's not keen to see them reintroduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those who sit up at the further end of the chamber like to talk a lot about emissions. A lot of hot air is expended discussing some of these issues, but what we should be recognisingâ€”again, this is for all Australians across the countryâ€”is that all Australians are now seeing that emissions are at a lower level, 19 per cent lower, than they were in 2005. That's the lowest level since 1995. So emissions have been reduced to their lowest level since 1995 under this government. But this government has done that with a Prime Minister who has led from the front and who made sure it was technology, not taxes. He didn't go out there to shut industries down. He didn't go out there to whack on every tax he could find. What we've done is invest in Australians across the countryâ€”all Australians, even those in WA who were let down by the health expenditures, who we know are incredibly poor and have been locked off from the rest of the country under that COVID doona.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also supported all Australians through schools. There has been an increase, from 2014 to 2021, in spending for schools. It's gone from $13.8 billion to $23.4 billion. That is a significant increase in expenditure in education, which, again, for those who have read the Constitution, is the responsibility of state governments. But the federal government, the Commonwealth government, led by this Prime Minister, is ensuring that every Australian is well supported, even when their premiers can't do their job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a very special place in my heart for the Hunter. The Hunter region is absolutely booming, and I am loving every minute that I get to spend up there. I cannot wait until New South Wales opens up, as our vaccination rates keep charging through, and Premier Berejiklian will stick to those lockdowns, making sure we can ease them off as soon as we can. Our vaccination rates are charging along, unlike some of those other states hiding under the doona. But you could almost call the Prime Minister the PM for the Hunter. He and I have been up there a couple of times together and have made significant announcements around investments that are going to boost that region. But not only are they for the people of the Hunter; they are going to boost the entire north-west of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know those opposite don't like New South Wales; we know that. They're all a bit jealous of Sydney. I know we've got the harbour. It's kind of the best stateâ€”and I say that having lived in three of them. That's fine. But the Hunter region opened up the whole north-west region. We've just spent $66 million investing in Williamtown airport not only for the Defence Force, securing those jobs, but to ensure that Newcastle can open up as an international destination once borders open up. Let's be honest: people from New South Wales will be going to London before they will be going to Perth with the way things are going at the momentâ€”and soon you will be able to fly from Newcastle.</span>

Having served in the New South Wales parliament for five years, I can tell you that I have had my fair share of disagreements with Premier Gladys Berejiklian and the New South Wales Liberals, but I have to say on this very rare occasion I do agree with them wholeheartedly: Scott Morrison is a Prime Minister for himself and no-one else.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say he is for himself and no-one else because Mr Morrison is the Prime Minister who was holidaying in Hawaii when bushfires were ravaging our forests, bush, communities and wildlife. I say he's for himself and no-one else because Mr Morrison is the Prime Minister who was gallivanting around in England when hundreds of thousands of us were barred from seeing our families overseas due to border closures. I say he's for himself and no-one else because Mr Morrison has completely bungled the vaccine rollout in Australia, which is his responsibility. More than 10 per cent of Wilcannia's mostly Aboriginal population is now infected with COVID-19. Tragically, one First Nations man from Dubbo has passed away. The vaccination rollout in western New South Wales has been miserably slow. These communities would not have been in this trauma and mess if the Prime Minister had done his job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say he's for no-one but himself because Mr Morrison chose to leave hundreds of thousands of temporary migrants and international students out of the government's COVID support packages, leaving them at the mercy of charity because they can't vote for him. I say he's for no-one but himself because Mr Morrison is plunging us ever deeper into a climate emergency which threatens the planet's and our future generations' very survival just because his campaign donations come from the fossil fuel lobby. It's not only that; we are in a climate code red and Mr Morrison is busy handing out hundreds of millions of dollars to his pals in the gas industry so they can frack the earth and pollute even more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a sham. What an absolute disaster this Liberal-National government is with Scott Morrison at the helm. Mr Morrison is not fit to be Prime Minister. The COVID-19 pandemic presented the Prime Minister with a chance to do things differently. Here was the Prime Minister's opportunity to redeem himself. Instead, inequality has skyrocketed and the climate crisis has gotten worse. Mr Morrison, you may not want to hold the hose, but the true fact of the matter is that you are holding us all back with your sheer incompetence and self-obsession. All you are interested in is holding on to power. To do what, though? It's to keep acting in your own political interests rather than those of the public. Acting in the public's interests is what you are here to do with the power and responsibility you have. Shame! For the sake of our collective peace of mind and collective blood pressure, I hope the Australian public has seen right through you and your shenanigans and that they vote you out come the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are sick of Mr Morrison's self-interest dominating all policy and political outcomes. It's time to get rid of this blight and take some real action on tackling inequality and the climate crisis. Only the Greens can share power with a Labor government, who we can give a big push to go further and faster and deliver this change and this hope for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  [by video link] The situation in New South Wales is very grim indeed, with almost 30,000 cases of COVID and 1,164 cases recorded today. There have been 94 deaths from this outbreak so far. There are deep concerns about the capacity of Western Sydney's hospitals. There have been queues of ambulances outside emergency rooms, with some waiting for up to eight hours, and there are concerns that staffing shortages will soon limit the state's surge ICU capacity. There is also the crisis unfolding in western New South Wales, where COVID has been spreading amongst a largely unvaccinated and vulnerable population. Yet the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, wants to declare 'mission accomplished'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is that it is going to get a lot darker before Mr Morrison's dawn. The trend is against us. The infection wave has not yet peaked. There is every indication that New South Wales is facing more terrible weeks and months ahead, and all of this was entirely preventable. It is an entirely predictable outcome of the Prime Minister's obvious failuresâ€”the botched vaccine rollout, the failure to set up quarantine facilities, and a constant undermining of the states' responses from day one. His failure is the greatest public policy failure in Australian political history, and it's ordinary Australians who are paying the price. The crisis is entirely a function of, and a reflection on, this Prime Minister's hollowman inadequacies, his complacency, his vanity, his refusal to take responsibility, and his inability to distinguish between his own political interests and the national interest. As this crisis continues, these failings are becoming more and more apparent to Australians. Over the weekend, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> reported:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Berejiklian is a Liberal team player who keeps her grievances about Morrison private. But, in private, she is scathing. The NSW Premier has told Liberal colleagues she'd have preferred Peter Dutton had won the last federal leadership ballotâ€”</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The article then goes on to chronicle the New South Wales Treasurer's efforts to establish an effective new JobKeeper scheme in New South Wales.

                <span class="HPS-Small">The politics seemed pretty plain â€“ Morrison didn't want to be seen to be abandoning the states. The two governments reverted to a fall-back plan, sharing the cost of increased supplementary payments instead. This confirmed the suspicion in the Berejiklian government that Morrison was more interested in the politics of appearance than the substance of outcomes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Has there ever been a more brutal summary of a political career than that? Mr Morrison was more interested in the politics of appearance than in the substance of outcomes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For three years the people of Australia have watched this unlikely Prime Minister. They've seen the announcements, the press conferences, the Facebook lives, the hectoring, the lists, the mansplaining, the slogans, the made-for-television marketing, the phoney ironed hi-vis jackets, the leaks, the negative briefings, the diversions, the gaslighting and the spin. And Australians have stopped listening. They've started to tune out from the bullying, the flip-flopping, the shifting goalposts, the mini-Trump efforts to create his own reality, the efforts to keep the story moving along. Marketing, spin and slick political messaging worksâ€”right up until the moment it stops working. And when it stops working, gravity takes over, and that's the problem for this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that there are over 1,000 daily infections in New South Wales, when we should be vaccinated, healthy and free. The reality is that Prime Minister Scott Morrison sat on his hands on vaccines, when it was his job to order them. He hasn't turned a sod or laid a brick for effective national quarantine and continues to undermine the health efforts of the states. The reality is that this Prime Minister has broken every promise he has made to the Australian people: that they would be first in the queue for vaccines, that stranded Aussies overseas would be home by Christmas, that four million vaccinations would be delivered to Australians by the end of March, that vaccination wasn't a race, that all aged-care residents and workers would be vaccinated by Easter 2021, that six million people would be fully vaccinated in May and four million by April, and now, confusingly, that apparently all Australians will be vaccinated by October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that millions of Australians are waiting for their vaccinesâ€”in the bush, in Western Sydney and among aged-care residents and workers, disability workers, NDIS recipients, schoolteachers, Indigenous Australians, children, supermarket workers and truckies. The reality is that millions of us are locked down with no end in sight because of this Prime Minister. The consequences of lockdowns and the public health measures that his own backbench complain aboutâ€”unemployment, the mental health impacts, the impacts on kids, lost opportunities, the dragging back of economic growthâ€”are entirely a function of the failure of this Prime Minister's leadership and his incapacity to do his job on behalf of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is preparing for his 'mission accomplished' moment. Yesterday he said our vaccine challenges had been overcome. He must be living in a different universe to the rest of us. Mr Morrison received his vaccine early this year, but millions of Australians are still waiting for theirs, because of his failure on vaccine delivery. He thinks his best chance of re-election is to try to pretend everything is somebody else's problem, everything is somebody else's fault. I saw today the efforts to blame the people of Wilcannia themselves for the low levels of vaccination in that township. And he wants to suggest that it will all be over very soon. But it won't. Gladys Berejiklian, the New South Wales premier, knows it; Mr Perrottet, the New South Wales treasurer, knows it; and the Australian people know it. They know who he isâ€”more marketing than man, more Billy McMahon than even Billy McMahon was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister for New South Wales? The New South Wales Liberals know that's not true; he is the Prime Minister for nobody but himself. He is interested only in his own political interests, not in the interests of the Australian people. The New South Wales Liberals themselves know that the only good way to look at this Prime Minister is through the rear-vision mirror.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I rise to make some remarks about this matter of public importance. As a member of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, I can assure the Senate that the New South Wales division would regard the Prime Minister as a favourite son. I recall that back in 2019, which seems like a long time ago now, there were two electionsâ€”one state election and one federal electionâ€”in which the Premier and the Prime Minister campaigned on a regular basis across Sydney and the state of New South Wales. That is the position that we have seen throughout this pandemic. There has been a high level of coordination between the state government and the national government here in Canberra. That is what I think people have come to expect from this government. It has been a government that has accepted that, in a national pandemic and an economic shock, there is a need for the federal government to work closely with the state governments because, under our constitutional system, power and responsibilities are shared across the federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people have complained about the former Council of Australian Governments, which was put to death by the Morrison government for good reason. I think it was described regularly as a place where good ideas went to die, and that was the case. The establishment of the national cabinet, which is an innovation designed to bring together the health and economic responses that Australia requires as a federation to get through this pandemic, has been very successful. You can look at the data points and you can look at what has happened across the globe. I think what really matters to people is: how many people have died, how many infections have there been and what has the economic response been like in terms of the rebound after you've had lockdowns and public health measures in place? On deaths we effectively still have the lowest rate among comparable countries; we still have a very low rate of infection; and we have the strongest economic rebound of all OECD nations so far. That has been the net position so far for Australia, some 18 months into this pandemic, with the national cabinet at the centre of our response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, New South Wales had a particularly good year relative to other jurisdictions and states that we would regularly compare ourselves with on the eastern seaboard. For the most part, New South Wales remained open while Victoria was closed. Now, 2021 has been a tougher year as the delta variant has taken hold in Sydney, and I think you'll find that the Premier and the Prime Minister have levelled with the Australian people. New South Wales has been the Australian state where the delta variant has seated itself on the mainland, where it is destined to stay. These two leaders have spoken the truth, as has the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the reality is that no major city across the world has been able to withstand the delta variant. Delta is ultimately going to embed itself in every major city, and the sooner people get out, get vaccinated and have public health orders, rules and plans to manage delta, the better. I don't think Western Australia has a plan to manage the pandemic. I think its plan has been to close the border. That is not a plan to manage the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan in New South Wales has had to change because, as a result of carrying this country for these last 18 months, New South Wales has been highly exposed to hotel quarantine. Everyone wants to assist Australians to come back to this country; that requires hotel quarantine, and 75 or 85 per cent of the hotel quarantine has been done in New South Wales. When Victoria went offline last year, they didn't do any hotel quarantine. We've heard senators complain, bemoaning the relatively high level of cases in New South Wales, but, even with a thousand cases a day, New South Wales is still doing hotel quarantine. So these are the risks you face when you're a global city trying to carry the rest of the continent through a pandemicâ€”you will face delta, and it will come to all the other jurisdictions that have no or low levels of case numbers at the moment. That is the reality, and that is where Australia is heading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, having dealt relatively well with the economic and health issues, we have seen the Prime Minister work well with the state premiers, including the Premier of my state, New South Wales, on the recent outbreak. We have seen very significant fiscal supportâ€”over a billion dollars a weekâ€”going into New South Wales. Businesses are able to go onto Service NSW and access the disaster support payments for their businesses, the JobSaver payments, and these are in addition to the payments provided by the Commonwealth through the Services Australia system. The Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales are going halves in relation to these JobSaver payments, which are putting in place a floor under businesses, which we want to see open up fully in the next eight to nine weeks in New South Wales. I think that shows the high level of coordination and cooperationâ€”that there has been an agreement that the federal government and the state government would pay for JobSaver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, more broadly, there's also been a high level of coordination in terms of vaccinations. There's no question that, with the outbreak in Sydney, there has been a much higher need for vaccinations, and the national government has prioritised getting vaccinations to Sydney in particular. Of the one million additional doses of Pfizer that came from Poland, more than half a million went into south-west Sydney, in order to get people protected, because, of course, just one shot of the vaccine provides a good level of protection against the virus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, across the state, into the western districts of New South Walesâ€”where we unfortunately do have a COVID outbreak in some Indigenous communitiesâ€”the national government has deployed an AUSMAT team and additional vaccinations to support the state government in getting vaccinations into those remote Indigenous communities, which I've visited myself. It is very regrettable that there is COVID in those areas, but we are working swiftly with the state government to ensure that vaccines can go into arms as quickly as possible. When you have COVID in your community, the best thing you can do is to get a vaccination. I think it is a testament to the high level of coordination and cooperation between the federal and state governments that there has been a huge influx of vaccinations into New South Wales, where, as of today, 67 per cent of our citizens have had a first dose. In New South Wales we're leading the nation once again on vaccinations. I believe that that means that New South Wales will be the first state to get real freedom, because we will have had the honest conversation with our citizens that delta is here, it won't be able to be eradicated, and we're going to have a high level of vaccinations, and that will make us able to reopen very quickly. And that has been possible because of the coordination between these two governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been an 18-month battle with the pandemic. Last year we deployed the very successful JobKeeper scheme, which underpinned Australia's world-leading economic response. But we also had the very successful early release super scheme, which the people across the aisle, I think, have been very supportive of, because they know that giving people access to their own money in a pandemic and in an economic shock is the right thing to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important to put one's citizens ahead of one's donors. I know that's a troubling concept for people across the aisle. The reality is that, with Australia facing the greatest economic and health crisis since the Second World War, the super funds and the Labor Party have been more interested in saving the super funds than in saving Australia. That is a great shame and a great stain on the Labor Party. Of course, this discussion comes on a day when we have seen Labor's former Treasurer Mr Swan become the chairman of one of the major super funds. I guess the real question is: does big super own Labor or does the Labor Party own big super? That is a question for the ages but certainly a question I hope the Senate can debate one day in a future matter of public importance discussion. I think it would be quite an illuminating discussion and I look forward to it happening, perhaps in the next session.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reported views of members of the NSW Liberal Government, including that they consider Mr Morrison to be 'the Prime Minister for Morrison and no one else'.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While that is increasingly heard in the media, among members of the government, among members of the Liberal and National parties and among the people, I reflect on an additional, more significant and rapidly growing conclusion among the people, and it's allied to the one this MPI debates. That conclusion is that the parliament of Australia is for the parliament. By that they mean the parliament is working for both the tired old partiesâ€”that is, the Liberal-Nationals and the Labor Partyâ€”and the people of Australia are the ones paying the price, because the people are serving the parliament, when we need to get back to the parliament serving the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very positive about Australiansâ€”our resources, our opportunities, our potentialâ€”yet I'm very worried about Australia, because of shoddy governance for many decades, and so are the peopleâ€”for example, the truckies. The truckies recently blockaded a highway south of Brisbane. Truckies are the salt of the earthâ€”regular people, real people. There's nothing that hasn't been on a truck, whether during processing or after it has been made and sent to market. Truckies interact with everyoneâ€”all ways of life, all callings and all needs. Now they're calling out the politiciansâ€”and not just those from the government; truckies are calling out politicians generally. Why? Because they're feeling doubtful, confused, afraid, overwhelmed and hopeless, and they're getting angry and feeling very frustrated. Why? Because of their need for a livelihood, which is being threatened; their need for survival; their need for truth and honestyâ€”a basic need; their need for consistency and ease, predictability; their need to be heard by the members who are supposed to represent them in parliament; their need for leadership, trust, integrity, credibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the data. We've now had hundreds of days of lockdown in Victoria, months in some of the other states. It's capricious: smacked on and taken off suddenly. People's lives have been ruined. There has been stress, isolation, poverty, suicide, domestic violence. There have been cruel restrictions. One of a pair of twins was lost because their parent was denied access to a Brisbane hospital because she came from northern New South Wales. Fancy losing a twin because of some capricious government or bureaucrat!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents are dying without the comfort of their kids. Kids in cancer treatment are alone because their parents have to go into lockdown. Then we have curfews. We have local government authorities in areas of Sydney calling on people to show their papers before they can move from one LGA to another. There is child suicide, domestic violence, alcohol abuse. There are kids at boarding school unable to go home for the holidays and see their families. There are now threats and bribes to get people to vaccinate, and those threats are undermining vaccination itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Health Organization says that lockdowns are to be used only initially, to get control of the virus. Well, 18 months is not 'initially'. Every time a government slaps on a lockdown in this country it is admitting, for the whole world to see, that it does not have control of the virus. Clearly, there is no planâ€”people can see and feel thatâ€”but politicians lack the strength of character to admit their error. They're locked in, gutlessly, to save face in front of the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National and Labor governments, state and federal, are pushing this rubbish on the people of Australia. The people, though, are starting to get the Liberals to backpedal. What is happening is that the data is starting to come out: people are feeling the pain, and they're saying, 'To hell with you lot.' They want to sort out parliament. But the politicians still won't back down, because of the fear they have drummed up, the fear that they have ingrained in our society and that is killing people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see now, for the first time ever, are the Liberal, Nats and Labor pushing an untested and unproven vaccine. For the first time in history we see governments injecting healthy people with something that can kill them, and is killing many. At the same time, we see ivermectin, a now proven, safe, effective and affordable treatmentâ€”and a preventative; a prophylacticâ€”and the Liberal, Nats and Labor are stopping this treatment. There's a complete lack of a plan, a bias away from the data and a contradiction of the data. All the truckies want is to have simple, basic needs metâ€”an end to damaging lockdowns and curfews; vaccine by choice only; and children back to schoolâ€”so they can get on with their lives and their livelihoods and protect their family. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  A Prime Minister for no season. Poor leadership is something that we have in this country at the momentâ€”and, as we all know, this can lead us to catastrophic outcomes, as we are witnessing right now in this country. Poor leadership and certain characteristics are evident, including an inability to listen, a lack of empathy for others and an inability to take responsibility. We on this side know that the Prime Minister does not even have the ability to communicate effectively during this time of a pandemic. But now we see the New South Wales branch and the New South Wales government publicly expressing the same frustration. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ticked these boxes consistently during his tenure as Prime Minister of Australiaâ€”never more so than in the last 18 months. As I said, these are not just our views; these are the views of the New South Wales government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What COVID is doing to Australians is so evident to us, but I want to refer to survey data which suggested Australians are more worried about their job security and mental health than they are about the COVID breakouts and more deaths. The YouGov poll argues that one in three Australians believe vaccinations are the pathway back to normality, with only 22 per cent of people believing continued lockdowns should occur until the number of COVID cases reaches zero. What Australians want is a vision out of the pandemic and a time line for that. They want to see a light at the end of the tunnelâ€”and it's hard when 60 per cent of Australians find themselves in lockdown right now. They don't want a Prime Minister who cares only about himself and his own job; they want a Prime Minister who will lead. It is more important than ever for us to have a Prime Minister who has the conviction to be able to lead the Australian people.</span>

If we had a Prime Minister committed to keeping delta out of the country, then you may not have been forced to go through this ordeal that will stay with you for the rest of your life. Donna is happy that she has recovered. She was lucky that she survived, and she is now recovering slowly from COVID-19. Unfortunately, over a thousand Australians have died from COVID-19, and many, many more may still face that bleak outcome. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lack of vaccines and no fit-for-purpose quarantine system in our country. We have a Prime Minister who only had two jobs. It was his job to roll out the vaccine in a timely manner, but he said, 'There's no race,' and, 'Nothing to see here.' We all know that he's failed. We've even seen him reject the idea of having purpose-built quarantines to keep Australians safe. We know that hotel quarantine doesn't work. We know that we're losing too many people. We know that there are over 60,000 aged-care workers in this country who still haven't had a vaccine. We don't know how many carers delivering home-care packages haven't yet received a vaccine. This was a race, Mr Morrison, and it was a race that we needed to win.</span>

                  <a href="281697" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  Imagine this, Madam Acting Deputy President. We're often told that we in this place are out of touch, focused more on navel gazing and internal issues than on governing for the country. Today, Labor really are taking the cake, because they are more interested in navel gazing into internal Liberal Party issues than in what actually matters to the people of this countryâ€”the people of this country who are concerned about their jobs and who are concerned about their mental health. Do we really care what the Premier of New South Wales thinks about the Prime Minister behind closed doors when 44 per cent of Australians say they are concerned they are in a worse mental state today than they were pre COVID?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor would rather have us talking about an unsourced 'she said, she said' allegation that appeared in one weekend paper than have us governing the country. Well, I would rather focus on 'he did, he did'. Indeed, so would the Premier of New South Wales, because, when she was asked directly about this unsourced, uncorroborated claim that Labor are focusing on, Premier Berejiklian said, on the record, 'I thank the Prime Minister for his support during the entire course of the pandemic, but especially in relation to this outbreak.' The support that we have provided to New South Walesâ€”and all states, but specifically New South Walesâ€”is evident, because since 1 July this year over 1.7 million claims from New South Wales citizens for COVID disaster payments have been granted, claims valued at $921 million with a further $2.6 billion being issued via recurring payments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have their slogan of the week. 'The PM had just two jobs,' they say. Well, if that's the case, I'm going to say: 'Prime Minister, slow down. You are clearly overachieving.' As well as the two jobs that the Labor Party say he should be focusing on, the Prime Minister has also led national cabinet to an agreed, updated, four-step <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response</span>. The Prime Minister has led an expansion of the New South Wales business support package, which now supports more than 400,000 businesses employing 3.3 million workers just in New South Wales. That's only in New South Wales, not to mention the expanded support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got an additional $400 million in Victorian business support packages. We've increased the disaster payment to $750 for individuals who've lost 20 or more hours work a week. We've also secured an extra 85 million doses of Pfizer, providing access to additional booster vaccines into the future that will protect Australians in an ongoing way. We've invested $125.7 billion in Medicare over the forward estimates. We've announced $36 million in innovative medical product manufacturing projects, which bring manufacturing onshore to help protect Australians and keep Australians safe from COVID. We've extended telehealth consultations. We've waived childcare gap fees for parents. We've unveiled $1 billion in funding to underpin the first Closing the Gap Implementation Plan, which has been developed with Indigenous Australians, not for Indigenous Australians. We've announced a financial and wellbeing redress scheme for living stolen generations members. We've aided the Queensland government in its very successful bid to secure the 2032 Olympic Games. Congratulations to Queensland. The list goes on. I congratulate our government for overachieving. Keep up the good work, Prime Minister.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the Australian Government (the Government) Response to the Joint Select Committee's (the Committee) report on Road Safety â€” Improving Road Safety in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 31 July 2020 the Committee released its interim report, noting that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, further time was required to consider evidence gathered during hearings and from submissions. The Final Report was published on 30 October 2020 and contains 22 recommendations to improve road safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has a responsibility, collectively with state and territory governments, for the strategic direction and implementation of national road safety policy and actions. The Government has a guiding and influencing role in road safety and established the Office of Road Safety (ORS) in July 2019, with the aim of improving coordination and leadership across all levels of government. While many of the levers for road safety are controlled by the states and territories, the Government is responsible for developing the National Road Safety Strategy with all states and territories and supporting its implementation; funding infrastructure investment aimed at delivering road safety outcomes; and regulating first imports of vehicles into the country. The National Road Safety Strategy 2021-30 (Strategy) and its Action Plan for 2021-2025 are expected to be released in the coming months, subject to jurisdictional approval processes.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory Ministers agreed in August 2019, through the former Transport and Infrastructure Council (Council), that the new Strategy would position Australia towards a 'Vision Zero' Target, with no person being killed or seriously injured from a road crash, by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Council also agreed in order to be successful in reducing road trauma over the decade, the Strategy must reach beyond traditional transport solutions and that road safety can no longer be viewed solely as a transport issue. To achieve this, Council agreed to adopt a social model approach to extend road safety opportunities into other sectors such as health and social services, law enforcement, education, justice, planning and industry, all of which will underpin the Action Plans supporting the new Strategy. A social model approach will allow the Strategy to reach beyond the areas that have traditionally coordinated road safety outcomes and foster a shift in road safety culture across Australian society to promote road safety as everyone's responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the Committee's recommendations relate to areas where implementation and delivery is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments. Where the Government has a national coordination role in delivering road safety outcomes, these are outlined in this response.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While consistent national data is available for road crash deaths, there is currently no national data source to report on the agreed national measure of serious injury. The Government and jurisdictions are pursuing a national project linking hospital and crash data to develop a consistent national source of serious injury data to allow measurement of progress against agreed serious injury targets in the new Strategy. To further support consistent data, the Government is investing $5.5 million over four years to establish a National Road Safety Data Hub, providing transparent monitoring and evaluation of road safety policies and investments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  [by video link] I want to begin this contribution by acknowledging that the last time Australia was totally free of foreign ownership was in 1788. This nation and almost all of the wealth that has been generated in this nation since 1788 have been founded on the forceful dispossession of First Nations people from their lands. Strictly speaking, unless you're a First Nations person in Australia, you are a foreign investor in this country. We should reflect on these facts and these circumstances whenever we are considering this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign investment in Australia largely occurs in the dark. If the government of the day want to keep quiet about who is investing, from where the investment is coming, what that investment is buying and on what conditions, then that is up to them, because the publication of any decision to approve an investment, the reasons for approving foreign investment and any conditions placed upon the approval of foreign investment are all at the discretion of the Treasurer. This is a lack of transparency that has to be addressed. I might add that the lack of transparency affects potential investors' expectations of what is or isn't acceptable in terms of foreign investment into Australia and it allows the government to make an arrangement with foreign investors that suits the government's political ends rather than the national interest. In a country where there is, shamefully, no independent Commonwealth-level national integrity commission, this creates an environment where corruption can flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the case study of the VDL dairy. As the inquiry heard, the sale of the VDL dairy to Moon Lake is a perfect example of a dodgy foreign-investment approval being used for political purposes. In 2016, with great fanfare, the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, approved the sale of VDL to the Chinese company Moon Lake, with the promise of $100 million to be invested and a near-doubling of jobs. There has been nothing but trouble since. Members of the board quit en masse soon after. Farm managers sought indemnity from liability because of substandard operating practices. The Tasmanian government's dairy regulator found most of VDL's farms were in breach of sanitary regulations. Nowhere near the promised $100 million has been invested, and there hasn't been anything like the promised doubling of jobs. Thanks to my friend and colleague Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, we found out that the government didn't even make Moon Lake's promises a condition of the approval. Despite running the joint to the ground on empty promises, Moon Lake was able to find $25,000 to donate to the Tasmanian Liberal Party. This looks suspiciously like the institutionalised bribery that is corporate political donations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get our house in order here. Given the current downturn in foreign investment, we have an outstanding opportunity to get our house in order, without being accused of targeting any particular investment or group of investors. While the chair's report provides excellent documentation of the problem, the recommendations fall far short of offering comprehensive solutions. We need to stop pussyfooting around. The Greens have made a series of recommendations that get to the heart of the issue. Publish the details of all foreign investment approvals so that we know what the government is up to, what is being approved and what the conditions of those approvals are. Any public undertakings made by a prospective foreign investor should automatically be made a condition of any subsequent approval, to stop investors making empty promises. The public register of foreign investment should include data on the current value, the tenure, the beneficial owner, the country of origin of the beneficial owner, and the use and jurisdiction of all land in which there is a foreign interest, so that we can see the whole picture. We should establish a public register showing the ultimate beneficial owner of companies registered or operating in Australia so that we know exactly which foreign actors are investing and have invested in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last but not least, we need to finally and belatedlyâ€”long after it was promisedâ€”include real estate agents, accountants and lawyers as designated services under the anti-money-laundering laws so that we can stop Australia being the laundromat of the South Pacific by way of foreign companies washing their money through Australian real estate. We should not allow our country to be used, in the way that it is, to launder money. We should not be languishing amongst the extremely small number of countries that have not legislated tranche 2, which includes real estate agents, accountants and lawyers as designated services under the anti-money-laundering laws. We should get serious about our position on anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism laws so that Australia is no longer the laundromat of the South Pacific. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the government 's response to the Joint Select Committee on Road Safety report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Improving road safety in Australia</span>. That report was delivered on 30 October 2020. I want to start by thanking the senators and members of the committee for this report, particularly my colleagues the member for Cunningham, the member for Kingsford Smith and Senator Glenn Sterle, and, of course, the deputy chair of the committee, my friend and colleague Senator Alex Gallacher, for whom road safety was such a priority for many years, not only in this place but also at the Transport Workers Union. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that it has taken almost a year for the government to deliver its response to this report. Road safety is an urgent, deadly issue, which requires an urgent and comprehensive response. It is an issue which impacts each and every Australian, and it particularly impacts workers in the road transport sector, for whom the road is their workplace. Far too many transport workers die on our roads every yearâ€”in trucks, vans and cars, and on motorcycles, mopeds and pushbikes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasingly, transport workers are engaged through an app, and, of course, their boss is an algorithm. The actual companies who ultimately control the app claim they have no responsibility for the safety of their workers. We have seen how this form of sham contracting has impacted on the safety of drivers and riders at Uber, Deliveroo and others. Australia watched with horror last year as five delivery riders lost their lives in just a matter of months: Dede Fredy, Xiaojun Chen, Chow Khai Shien, Bijoy Paul and Ik Wong. In June of this year we learned that there had been a sixth death, of Burak Dogan, whose death was covered up by Uber. It was covered up by Uber and not reported because he was killed 25 minutes after his last trip. He was still logged into the app until the moment of his death, but, because of the 25-minute gap after his last delivery, Uber and Uber's insurers have refused to pay insurance to his family. Because Uber called him a contractor rather than an employee, he and his family did not have access to workers compensation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just two weeks ago we learned that there had been even more incidents that Uber failed to share with regulators. The New South Wales Point to Point Transport Commissioner revealed that Uber had failed to report more than 500 serious incidents, including sexual assaults and serious crashes, over an 18-month period. This is a company which not only dodges taxes and dodges our industrial relations laws but also dodges any obligation it has to safety, wherever possible. Uber, quite simply, thinks it's above the law, and its arrogance and recklessness are a threat to the safety and wellbeing of everyone on Australian roads. Because Uber classifies its drivers as independent contractors, it also manages to avoid paying the Australian minimum wage. In fact, we know that Uber Eats riders are earning as little as $6.67 an hour. It is a return to Dickensian work conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In road transport, we know that unsustainable rates lead to unsafe decisions on the road, with people not being able to maintain their vehicles if they want to be able to keep their contract, keep their job and put food on the table. We know that because, for decades, owner-drivers and employees alike, together with the Transport Workers Union, have sought a system of safe rates. To quote the Joint Select Committee on Road Safety report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ heavy trucks were involved in 14.7 per cent of fatalities in 2016, despite making up just 3.13 per cent of registered vehicles â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The connection between pay and safety is now recognised in most of the road transport industry, both in Australia and around the world. To quote the Transport Workers Union: 'The common thread between drivers' health and risk-taking behaviours is pressure imposed upon truck drivers by their clients, particularly those at the apex of the supply chain.' This view is supported by local and international experts. The International Labour Organization says, 'After an extensive review of all of the literature that links pay and safety, this link has now been internationally recognised.' Emeritus Professor Michael Quinlan has said, 'Extensive academic research stretching over a 40-year period supports the relationship between payment levels, subcontracting and an array of OH&amp;S outcomes, including crashes and injuries.' On the employer side, Paul Ryan, from the Australian Road Transport Industrial Organisation, has said that it is essential to ensure:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ that, when something's contracted down two, three or four times and everyone takes their clip, the person down the bottom of that chain, whether it be a transport company or an owner operator, is paid a fair rate for the job that they're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Payment rates that make sure that people are able to maintain the vehicles are critical to avoiding incentivisation of risky behaviour. The choice about taking a fair wage, about maintaining your vehicle and about what you do regarding the dangers on the road should not be a consequence of employers demanding and allowing systems where people are on subsistence wages and are extended and stressed to do this work in any way possible. This type of behaviour is commonplace, and the misuse of market power encourages unsafe behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been attempts in the past to introduce these protections, including the failed Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Unfortunately, the RSRT did not live up to what many in the transport industry had hoped. It did not live up to what I, as a former National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, had hoped. But, although the RSRT ultimately failed, when it was removed by the Turnbull government it was replaced with nothing. Without any sort of protection or enforcement of safe rates, we saw the number of crashes involving truck drivers spike in the years after the RSRT was dissolved. There is blood on the Prime Minister's hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing conditions for owner-drivers and employee-drivers go from bad to worse. When owner-driver Frank Black wrote a column in <span style="font-style:italic;">Owner/Driver</span> magazine railing against unsafe rates, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sent him a letter threatening criminal charges. What did Frank say that was so outrageous? I will quote the column. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ I am unfortunately missing my grandson's first birthday for a job I would have otherwise turned down. Sacrificing our rest days and family life now is necessary to help keep the wheels turning in an attempt to ensure our business survives in a few months' time â€¦ We can't afford for rates to be lowered anywhere in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All that will happen if we undersell our work is that we all end up going bust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Was it an outrageous overstep? It certainly was an outrageous overstep by the ACCC. I've made this point to the ACCC chair, Rod Sims, at budget estimates, as have Senator Sterle and Senator Scarr. Mr Sims did not apologise for sending that letter. He was of the view that Frank Black's conduct may have been against the law. And that really demonstrates how grossly inadequate the laws for owner-drivers are in Australia. This response has been tabled just days after 7,000 owner-drivers and employee-drivers went on strike at Toll, while an additional 8,000 truck drivers at Linfox, Bevchain, StarTrack and FedEx are also heading towards strikes. When you have 15,000 truck drivers, across five major transport companies, heading to industrial action, what you have is big multinational companies being allowed to attack the rights and pay of workers and small-business owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those 7,000 Toll drivers are standing up against a proposal to bring in new employees on precarious, short-term contacts and outside hires on lower pay. It's a trick we are seeing across the economy: companies bringing in external workers on lower rates of pay and conditions to undercut their own workforce. We've seen it at Qantas, where the most antiworker CEO in Australia, Alan Joyce, set up his own labour hire company, Qantas Ground Services, to undercut his own Qantas employees. He then undercut them even further by contracting their jobs out to third parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />We're also seeing it in the mining industry, with labour hire casuals getting paid 24 per cent less, on average, than direct mine employees. We're also seeing it at Amazonâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  [by video link] I want to take note of the government's response to the order for the production of documents No. 1217, which was tabled just then. I, with the support of the Senate, asked for the spreadsheets that underpin the car park rorts that took place prior to the last electionâ€”those spreadsheets that laid out the 20-marginal-seat strategy and how hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds could be jammed into them for car parks so that the government could 'park-barrel' their way to victory at the last election. And what response have we got to this request for these critical documents? Minister's Fletcher's response, I'm sad to say, is to deny the Senate's request for the documents and to say they needed more time to consider their response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an appalling response from Minister Fletcher. It comes on top of his claim three weeks ago that these spreadsheets showing the top-20 marginal seats are cabinet documents, so they can't be revealed for two decades because it might make it more difficult for future governments to make politically challenging decisions. The government is happy to have the visibility of car parks to announce but not transparency or accountability as to how it made these decisions. If you're going to be making politically challenging decisions then that's all the more reason that you need to have transparency and accountability to be able to justify them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, the government not having enough timeâ€”needing to consider its responseâ€”stands in stark contrast to having plenty of time and plenty of staff hours to pour into compiling these colour-coded spreadsheets. This isn't the first time that we've had colour-coded spreadsheets. It's not the first time that the Senate has been denied documents. We had the sports rorts of course, where hundreds of sporting clubs across the country were dudded because of the Liberal Party's corruption. Now we have car park rorts, where hundreds of millions of dollars was wasted for a scheme that is pointlessâ€”for car parks that are not going to solve urban congestion. But, hey, if it was to win a few votes then what does it matter that these car parks are not going to solve urban congestion? It doesn't matter as long as there's money to be funnelled or jammed into these marginal seats!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is corruption. Who knows what program they're going to rort next? We don't, because this Liberal government is not accountable, is not transparent and is desperately trying to evade accountability. We've seen that in response to this order for the production of documents. There has been more delay, more obfuscation and more equivocating in response to a Senate order, but accountability is coming. We have a Senate inquiry underway. We will pursue these documents, just like we did with the sports rorts documents. Even if we don't manage to get them because they are hidden away, the fact that they are hidden awayâ€”the fact that it's very clear that this government has something to hideâ€”is going to be front of mind for the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to be seeking to uncover the whole outrageous and corrupt rorting. It's very clear that, just like sports rorts, this was coordinated out of the Prime Minister's office. It's very clear, from listening to Minister Fletcher's words three weeks ago when he claimed public interest immunity because these were cabinet documents, that the decision to spend the money in these electorates wasn't just a decision of the infrastructure minister or the urban infrastructure minister. No, it was clearly a decision that was coordinated out of the Prime Minister's office and was discussed at cabinet. That's the only reason you could say that these are cabinet documents and, therefore, are not available for the community to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we have seen this corrupt practice in sports rorts, in these car park rorts and in community schemes. The public have seen far too much of the Liberal Party's corruption and incompetence. It is not just grant schemes. We've seen hundreds of millions of dollars in grants going to their matesâ€”for example, to prop up gas mining in the Beetaloo basin, to subsidise the trashing of our climate and to undermine action on our climate crisis in the critical decade when action needs to be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a complete refusal to act on climate. They're stalling on electric vehicles and not taking the actions that are needed because they don't want to be doing anything that's going to upset their vested interests, their mates and their donors. This government does not deserve the support of the Australian public. For the good of the country, for the good of the globe when it comes to climate and for transparent and accountable government we need to kick them out. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

Instead, they have been published in the Commonwealth Gazette in accordance with the requirements of the Act as it currently exists. Counter-terrorism listings will continue to be set out in a Consolidated List which sets out all persons and entities who are subject to targeted financial sanctions under Australian sanctions law. This list is maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and published on the Department's website.

The Review found that it was important to establish a positive initial dental experience and instil important oral hygiene practices at an early age to curb the negative stigma around dental practitioners and oral hygiene, which is reinforced if the initial dental experience requires serious treatment. If parents promote and practice good oral health hygiene with their children from a young age this will help prevent more serious dental decay as they grow up.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  [by video link] I continue my earlier contribution on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. I was saying that I want to address the concerns that senators opposite, particularly Senator Waters, have raised in relation to the amendments in this bill because I am concerned that the government's position has been substantially misrepresented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recommendation 17 Commissioner Jenkins recommended that there be 'a positive duty on all employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation, as far as possible'. What I'd like to make clear is that the government is considering this recommendation, but there is quite a bit of complexity with it legally because of duties which already exist under work health and safety laws as well as the Sex Discrimination Act, including to ensure that additional complexity is not created for those seeking to use the protections. This includes an assessment against the model work health and safety laws, which already impose a positive duty on employers to protect workers from health and safety risks, including psychosocial risks such as sexual harassment, so far as is reasonably practicable. Work health and safety laws also provide for compliance, enforcement and inquiry functions to be exercised by work health and safety regulators. Employers that fail to meet obligations under work health and safety laws can be subject to prosecution and severe penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also considering the existing vicarious liability provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act, which ensure that if a worker engages in unlawful conduct such as sex discrimination or harassment then their employer can also be held liable for sexual harassment or sex discrimination if the employer did not take reasonable steps to prevent the conduct from occurring. This existing mechanism means that employers must take reasonable and preventive steps, such as implementing policies and providing training, to minimise their potential liability should an incident occur. So it is quite wrong for Labor and the Greens to characterise the government as not supporting a positive duty to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to return to a very significant provision of funding that we have provided in relation to implementation of the Respect@Work response. As I mentioned in my earlier contribution, it's some $64.3 million. This builds on an initial $2.1 million over three years that was provided in October 2020 to implement key recommendations of the report. Some of the further detail in relation to this very significant investment is a breakdown of that funding which has been provided in our budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $7.3 million over four years to support the Respect@Work Council in implementing a range of practical measures to address workplace sexual harassment and implementing amendments to strengthen the legislative and regulatory framework. There's $0.2 million in interim funding in 2021-22 to continue the targeted delivery of support for women on work-related matters, including workplace sexual harassment. There's $1.7 million over two years to Comcare to deliver national forums for Commonwealth, state and territory work health and safety inspectors on sexual harassment, and training for employers and managers covered by Commonwealth work health and safety laws to better understand and meet their obligations. There's $6 million over four years to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency and the Australian Public Service Commission to strengthen public sector reporting on sexual harassment prevalence, prevention and response. There is $5.3 million to the Department of Social Services to be provided to Our Watch, to Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety and to 1800RESPECT to build the evidence base and develop primary prevention initiatives to respond to sexual harassment. There's also $43.8 million over four years for additional legal assistance funding for specialist lawyers with workplace and discrimination law expertise. That is obviously a very significant additional investment as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe, and I think it is quite evident, that this bill evidences the government's commitment to seeing that women are safe in the workplace and to ensuring that women prosper in the workplace without fear of any form of sexual discrimination or harassment. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner's report was extremely well namedâ€”<span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span>. That's what we all want. That's what we all deserve. That is the government's focus. This bill delivers on the government's commitment to give women a voiceâ€”a voice of truth, a voice of justice. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I'd like to make a contribution to this very important debate on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. This bill represents the Morrison government's overdue response to Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work: national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces</span> report. The final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span>, was handed down to the government in January 2020 and made 55 recommendations to address the prevalence of sexual harassment in workplaces. It took this government more than a year and a half and a historic women's march to finally enact some form of a response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kate Jenkins reported in her review that, despite implementing world-leading reforms in 1984 with the Sex Discrimination Act, Australia now lags other countries in preventing and responding to sexual harassment. Workplace harassment not only causes untold psychological damage, but Deloitte Access Economics calculated that it also cost the Australian economy $3.8 billion in 2018 alone. The report made it very clear that sexual harassment is rife within Australian workplaces, that it is extremely damaging and that existing laws are not working to protect workers. It stated that reform is urgently needed, yet it took the Morrison government 18 months to respond, and this bill will not deliver the level of reform required. This did not stop Liberals from making a big, flashy statement. That's what they do. They made an announcement explaining that they had agreed to all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, but, like with most things with this government, you must look at the fine detail. You have to look at the fine print. This bill, which has taken more than a year and a half to introduce, implements only six of the 55 recommendations in a watered-down reform. In its current form, this bill will not deliver the substantive change needed to address the systematic issues of sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. It shows that the Morrison government is not genuine in improving outcomes for women and in making workplaces safer for everyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021 amends the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Fair Work Act 2009 to improve the mechanisms for preventing and tackling workplace sexual harassment. We will not vote against this legislation, as we will not stand in the way of these changes that may help make workplaces safer. But we believe that additional amendments are needed. This bill does not adopt recommendation 17 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work </span>report calling for the amendment of the Sex Discrimination Act to include a positive duty on employers to take responsible measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a submission to the inquiry into this bill, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the SDA, reported that 39 per cent of SDA members experienced workplace sexual harassment in the last five years, which is significantly higher than the general workforce at 33 per cent. Alarmingly, this number is higher for female members under the age of 18, where over 50 per cent have experienced sexual harassment in the last five years. It sets an unacceptable precedent when you consider that retail and fast food are the most common industries in which young people get their first jobs and start their working lives. Given the high level of occurrence, it is essential that the Morrison government impose a positive duty on employers to take responsibility for eradicating workplace harassment. Frontline workers in retail have been undercover heroes of this pandemic, keeping Australia going through lockdowns and ensuring we have access to essential goods and services. They are exhausted and unappreciated, in having deal with soaring volumes of sales with little time to prepare. They are putting their lives at risk every day. They deserve better from the Morrison government, from protection from workplace harassment to being prioritisedâ€”and I mean prioritisedâ€”in the vaccine rollout. They continue to be let down on both of these fronts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only in the midst of the pandemic, as a result of the pressure applied on the government at the start of this year over their handling of the Brittany Higgins case, that women were miraculously moved up on the agenda. But, as with most of the government's responses, it's superficial in nature. Australian women need action from the government, not just words. They need real leadership, not someone who goes into hiding when things get tough. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, Commissioner Jenkins made it clear that the prevention of sexual and sex based harassment in the workplace would require a long-term, sustained effort, leadership and political will. With this watered-down bill before us, Australian women will not get that from the Morrison government. They will not get it from this cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only after Senator Cash's appointment as Attorney-General that the Morrison government even bothered to respond to the report. The previous minister took no action. I wonder why? The government argued that it was busy managing COVID-19 and Australia's recovery, but I call that into question: what recovery? As we have said time and time again in this place, the Prime Minister had two crucial jobs during this pandemic. One was to respond by rolling out the vaccines as quickly and as effectively as possible, which he hasn't been able to do because he didn't bother buying enough vaccines to vaccinate the entire population. The second was to build purpose-built quarantine facilities. He bailed on both of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham has already advised that New South Wales is likely to be locked off to the rest of Australia for the rest of the year. The Morrison government should have foreseen the havoc that the delta variant would cause in our country, but they failed to heed the warnings and instead did nothing. There was plenty of evidence from what was happening overseas, but this Prime Minister, along with the Minister for Health and Aged Care, failed to respond in an appropriate manner. Now our death toll has increased. Frontline workers continue to put their health at risk. Families will be separated for months. Events will be cancelled. Our economy will probably slip into recession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since June there have been up to 15 million Australians in lockdownâ€”that is, 60 per cent of our population. Not only is this hurting our economy; lockdowns are associated with an increase in domestic violence and, in particular, violence against women. As was experienced last year, the people who have lost their jobs first through the lockdowns are casuals, and women are overrepresented among the people who have lost their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are all spin. They have no intention of bringing meaningful reform to workplaces. They are full of excuses when it comes to the vaccine rollout. There is a complete refusal to commit to a national quarantine system. How can we expect anything different when it comes to protecting Australians from harassment in their workplaces? Time and time again this government has failed to enact meaningful reform, and this bill is just a tactical ruse for a government weighed down by allegations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Morrison governmentâ€”to show that they do, in fact, want to bring meaningful change to the systemic issues in workplaces, with harassment being of such prevalenceâ€”to enact the full suite of recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. This is the only way to ensure that there are more robust measures in place to prevent, address and redress sexual harassment in the workplace. A Labor government would implement and adopt all of the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> reportâ€”that's all 55 recommendations, not six, which is all this government is attempting, with this feeble piece of legislation, to enact: six, out of 55.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite not being specifically recommended by the report, we have also moved on an amendment to implement 10 days of paid domestic family violence leave. It is not only Labor but also stakeholders who believe that this is essential in reforming women's safety at work. We all know that economic independence is instrumental in helping someone escape from family violence, and this amendment would provide a safety net. It would give victims the time to deal with any matters that they need to deal with, in order for them to take steps to leave the situation of abuse which they have found themselves in. You should not have to resign or be terminated because of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my lifetime, women of my generation would have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace on quite a regular basis. There's not one of my cohort of friends who has not experienced or witnessed sexual harassment in the workplace or who has not had to prove her worth for promotion, based on her gender. I remember, in one of my positions in a short-term finance company, when I lived in Melbourne, when men joined the company they were able to join the superannuation fund, but women like me might have been invited to join that superannuation fund after they had worked for the company for 10 yearsâ€”that was the lived experience. Well, thank goodness for Paul Keating and what the Labor government did in introducing superannuation for every worker in this country, because superannuation was one of the economic circumstances in which your gender was used against you in workplaces. Regrettably, it is only a Labor government that will meaningfully improve outcomes for women. Only a Labor government can be trusted to bring the reforms to Australian workplaces so that we can again be a world leader when it comes to prevention of discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, in this country we led the way, butâ€”as we've talked about so many times in this chamberâ€”we've now had eight years of Liberal governments and we seem to be falling further and further behind in so many areas. We certainly haven't taken the opportunity to learn, in relation to this pandemic, about what happened through the US, Europe and, particularly, England, and to make sure that people weren't having to wait for a vaccine. We still have a situation where too many people can't even get an appointment yet for the vaccine. We've spoken on a number of occasions today about how many aged-care workers are still waiting to get their first jab. We still don't know, of the people who are delivering home-care-package care into older, vulnerable Australians' homes, how many still have not had a vaccine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do know that the majority of those in this country being penalised and discriminated against based on their gender or age are women, time and time again. Sexual harassment can go for both genders. That is deplorable as well, and no-one here would say otherwise. But it's time that we spoke up for women and made the changes necessary to keep workplaces safe for all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021â€”a bill this government has had to be dragged to finally bring to the table, though it still leaves much to be desired. Today we are marking Equal Pay Day and shamefully, staring at a gender pay gap of 14.2 per cent. It is pertinent to be debating this bill on sex discrimination and fair work today because the same structures of power, privilege and patriarchy that prevent us from reaching pay equality are the ones that allow sexism, sexual harassment and bullying to continue in workplaces and in society at large. It is way beyond time that we take strong action to dismantle these systems and hold those who perpetuate these injustices to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women around the country have spoken their truth about the harassment, bullying and abuse they have been subjected to and have made it clear in no uncertain terms that they will not rest until this stops. The reality is that no workplace is safe from sexual harassment. You would be hard-pressed to find a woman who has not endured an unwanted sexual advance, be it verbal or physical, subtle or blatant. Young or old, white, brown or black, executive, teacher, student, political staffer, journalist or waitress, famous or completely anonymous, as women, no matter who we are, we are targets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important, though, to recognise and highlight the ways in which different women face discrimination. Women at the intersections of racism and sexism face multiple and layered added challenges. The advocacy group Women of Colour Australia, in partnership with Murdoch University, recently released a survey that revealed that almost 60 per cent of women who responded to their survey had experienced discrimination in the workplace. What's more, most respondents, about 57 per cent, felt they had faced challenges in the workplace related to their identity as a woman of colour. It is this layered oppression that is absent from our mainstream discourse on the issues faced by women.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Temporary migrant workers face significant barriers in pursuing complaints about exploitative treatment at work which emanate from strong power differentials between an employer and visa holder. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that women on the margins experience their workplaces and society in general very differently from others. While we talk about gender inequality and discrimination at work, we must work to address the distinct challenges faced by women of colour, migrant women, First Nations women and other marginalised women's groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, every workplace and every person within that workplace must take up the responsibility of preventing the scourge sexual harassment. This workplace right here, the Parliament of Australia, my workplace, must show leadership and ownership of becoming a safe, equal, inclusive, supportive and just workplace, so we can set the example for other workplaces to follow. This requires transparency and accountability as well. But we are so far from it. The culture of this place leaves so much to be desired. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really hope that every single member of this place, and especially Mr Morrison's cabinet, has read the comprehensive <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins. This report, which makes for sobering reading, found that the rate of change in Australia on sexual harassment and discrimination at work has been disappointingly low. Australia lags behind other countries in preventing and responding to sexual harassment. It found our current laws not just lagging but also confusing and insufficient. We can and we must do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill in front of us implements some recommendations from the Respect@Work inquiry, but not all. The Morrison government received Commissioner Jenkins' report on sexual harassment in the workplace in Australia in March 2020. So it is thoroughly disappointing to see that nearly 18 months later its legislative response misses the opportunity to implement the recommendations in full. Indeed, it ignores one of the core recommendations, to put the onus on employers to maintain a safe workplace rather than on vulnerable workers and victims to take action against harassers. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report set out a comprehensive, practical and targeted suite of reforms that were developed after many interviews and consultations with stakeholders. The report presented a holistic plan to address discrimination and structural inequalities to relieve the burden on victims and to make workplaces safer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report recommends enacting a positive duty on employers to prevent sexual harassment, sex discrimination and victimisation, with accompanying enforcement powers. This recommendation has been dismissed by the government. The Respect@Work inquiry found the current system places a heavy burden on individuals to make a formal complaint, yet the government continues to doggedly and misleadingly claim that the positive duty in the Sexual Discrimination Act is not necessary as work health and safety laws include a duty to ensure workplaces are safe. Well, isn't it clear to us that the positive duty in work health and safety laws has completely failed to protect women from sexual harassment and discrimination at work? If it were protecting people, we wouldn't see nearly 40 per cent of women experiencing sexual harassment at work. The government's dismissal reinforces the victim-must-complain approach, which unfairly puts the onus on victims and is clearly not working, given the prevalence of sexual harassment in our workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that eliminating workplace sexual harassment will take a big cultural shift away from sexism and patriarchy. The positive duty on the employer to create and maintain a safe workforce would be a step towards achieving this cultural shift and would work as a signal to workers that their employers are invested in creating a safer workplace for all. The report very clearly endorsed that the legal and regulatory framework should encourage and support employers to take proactive and preventative measures to address sexual harassment rather than rely on individual complaints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of submissions to the Senate inquiry on the bill emphasised the positive duty recommendation as absolutely critical to achieving the objectives of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. The government's refusal to enact a positive duty requirement on employers is in direct contrast to evidence provided by legal experts, unions and practitioners. Among them were the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Discrimination Law Experts Group, the Women's Legal Centre ACT, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Community and Public Sector Union, to name just a few. The ACTU said in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We strongly support this key recommendation. The Bill should be amended as recommended by Respect@Work to include a new positive duty on employers. Unlawful discrimination provisions only arise once a complaint has been made, which places too much burden on individual complainants. A new positive duty would complement (not duplicate) existing duties under WHS laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Commission reiterated its recommendation that the bill include a positive duty on all employers, and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This would be a powerful tool to promote broad systemic and cultural change that sits outside of the current adversarial framework of discrimination law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Tania Constable, the chief executive officer of the Minerals Council of Australia, told the Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">... the positive duty that already exists works for traditional physical health and safety risks; it is clearly not working for sexual harassment. Therefore, given the significant issue, we support there being a positive duty in the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the Senate can support the Greens' amendment to include the recommendation of the positive duty on employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the bill in front of us extends the application of the act to state employees, which is an issue that is particularly close to my heart. In August 2016, during my time in New South Wales state parliament, a woman rang my office and reported that she had been fired after telling her boss she was pregnant. When she lodged a complaint she was told it was perfectly legal to dismiss her. I could not believe this was possible in the 21st century in New South Wales, but it was. Two subsections in the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 allowed employers to dismiss or not hire an employee who knew they were pregnant at the time of the job interview or at the time of hiring. So I got to work. We gave notice of a bill to make this change, ran a campaign and lobbied the government. Six months later, the New South Wales government made the change to remove this exemption. Although we were able to remove pregnancy discrimination from the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, there still exists a double standard for state employees, who are exempted from Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws. I'm glad to see this bill will finally remove this double standard. This is a step forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the bill amends the objectives of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to include 'to achieve, so far as practicable, equality of opportunity between men and women', I have to say that the words 'so far as practicable' really irk me. This is a step down from the recommendation of the inquiry, which suggested that the objective be 'to achieve substantive equality between men and women'. 'So far as practicable' is not going to take us very far at all, especially not under a Liberal-National government which has already dragged its heels on this important reform. This narrow-minded interpretation of the report falls short of community expectations and well short of the legal changes that we need to address the widespread issue of workplace harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women have fought and won so many battles along the way to gender equity, but there are many more to win. Gaining the right to run for parliament has not yet led to equal representation. Women have joined the workforce in droves. We work hard and we pursue every career under the sun. Still, we are undervalued, underpaid and discriminated against. Gendered violence kills one woman a week. The feminisation of poverty means we earn less and our jobs are more insecure and casualised. It's undeniable that the impacts of COVID-19 are exacerbated for women in every sphere of economy and society. Australia's ranking in the global gender gap index has been steadily dropping for more than a decade. These are huge disparities that become even worse for First Nations women, migrant women, refugee women, women of colour, trans women and disabled women, as they fall through the cracks in the reporting of these statistics and in the enactment of change, however incremental.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as we talk about Respect@Work, let's acknowledge that the goal of gender parity will not be achieved unless we dismantle the structures of power, privilege and patriarchy. The economic, social and political oppression of women continues because patriarchy is allowed to flourish. Feminism is the antidote to patriarchy. I am proud to be feminist AF. Let's make sure that our feminism is powerful, that it is collective and that it is for all and with all women. The message that women across Australia have given us is clear. They demand an end to sexism, harassment, discrimination, rape culture and the mistreatment of women, in parliament, in workplaces and in the community. We must hear this message and act on it. It's our job.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  As we saw on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> today, Australians are actually more concerned about their mental health and job security than they are about COVID. Whilst this has ramifications for how we learn to live with the virus, open up, end lockdowns and remove border restrictions, we're also focused as a government on ensuring that everyone feels safe and secure at work. The Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021 will quickly and clearly implement a series of legislative reforms that the government committed to in <span style="font-style:italic;">Roadmap for respect</span>. These improvements to the anti-discrimination industrial relations framework will see changes around sexual harassment in the workplace. What was once something that happened far too frequently and was often ignored or swept under the carpet is no longer acceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I never thought I'd be mentioning Dolly Parton in this place, but, thanks to lockdowns, my consumption of documentaries has significantly increased, so over the weekend I watched the one on Dolly Parton. Whilst it looked at her whole career, a large part of it was devoted to perhaps her most well-known movie, <span style="font-style:italic;">9 to 5</span>. I remember seeing that movie when I was pretty young, and, whilst the movie was ultimately about women working together and taking back their power, the behaviour of the male boss was what we would today consider wildly inappropriate, to put it mildly. But, when that movie was made, that sort of behaviour was seen as so commonplace that no-one really raised an eyebrow about it. In fact, the slurs were directed at the woman who was being chased around the desk and inappropriately propositioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, that sort of behaviour is no longer tolerated, certainly not at that level. But we do know there is still behaviour that occurs that's not acceptable, behaviour that makes people feel unsafe in their workplaces, especially where there are significant power imbalances and people feel insecure in their job. The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act will aim to ensure, so far as practicable, that there is equality of opportunity between men and women to clarify that sex based harassment is prohibited. It will also remove the current exemptions for state public servants, members of parliament, ministerial staff as well as judges. In fact, it will ensure the prohibitions against sexual harassment and sex based harassment cover all forms of workers. Everyone is now legislatively protected regardless of where they work. And for those who perpetrate the harassment, under the clarification that victimisation is unlawful, this can now form the basis of civil action against them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, while these are clear and concise improvements in this area, there is another part of the bill I wanted to particularly draw attention toâ€”the granting of paid compassionate leave if an employee or their partner experiences a miscarriage. Miscarriage is still in some ways seen as a taboo topic, something we don't talk about or really acknowledge in the way that we should. Any parent will tell you that, from the moment they found out they were expecting, they were parents. It was their baby. But we know that up to one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage. That's around 300 women every single day experiencing this. We don't know about many of them because many people still don't tell anyone that they are expecting until they hit that 12-week mark. And, when it does occur, people often fail to recognise the real grief that is being felt. They make comments like, 'It's lucky it happened early,' or, 'Maybe there was something wrong with it.' The parents' grief is diminished or dismissed in a way grief would never normally be treated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, I spoke to the CEO of Pink Elephants, Sam Payne. It's the only national miscarriage support service in Australia. They are incredibly welcoming of this leave-for-loss plan, as they refer to it. She welcomed the opening up of the conversation and the recognition that this is a tragic event for many, many couples and that this leave includes partners because, while we should always remember that the physical loss is experienced by the mother, partners also feel the grief around the loss of that child. For anyone requiring support, pinkelephants.org.au have the resources to help you and to remind you that you did nothing wrong and that it is natural to grieve. The women involved in this organisation have all experienced miscarriage themselves. They know that, while time heals, the pain never truly goes away. The fact is so many women keep going. They try again and, sometimes, again and again to have that child. This resilience is incredible. So thank you Pink Elephants for the work that you do and the work that you have done in this space, for ensuring miscarriage is something we acknowledge, and that we acknowledge appropriately, and support those experiencing this significant loss.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  I am angry about the inadequacy of the legislation before us today in parliament, the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. More than a year and a half has passed since the release of the Human Rights Commission's landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, written by Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins. What the report found was that our workplaces and the laws that govern them are failing to provide workplaces that are free from sexual harassment and discrimination. There hundreds of stories from women and men about the sexual harassment that they have been subjected to in their workplaces. It is utterly shameful that this government has stood idly by while people, especially women, continue to be victimised in their workplaces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government waited more than a year and a half before responding to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. An advance copy of the report was given to the government as early as January last year, before it was released publicly in March last year, but the then Attorney-General, Mr Christian Porter, left it to gather dust on his desk. He did nothingâ€”nothingâ€”about this scourge of sexual harassment that was well documented in the commissioner's report. He did not once meet with the commissioner about the report or its recommendations. He ignored the report and disrespected the process. How could he have been handed a landmark report about how we, as a nation, could make our workplaces safer, especially for women, and then baldly ignore it, especially in the face of the trauma that had been revealed inside that report?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year, when the Prime Minister asked Attorney-General Porter to step down amidst allegations of workplace sexual assault and harassment in the parliament itself and historic rape allegations against the minister, this government had still not responded to this report. It was only following Senator Cash's appointment as Attorney-General that the government then rushed to respond to it. So, in many ways, I am not surprised at the entirely limited legislation that we now have before us to address this scourge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The response itself and the legislation before us have not been not deeply considered. In fact, we've seen senators opposite say: 'We haven't got to the issue of a positive duty yet. We're still considering that. We haven't rejected it.' You have had an extraordinary length of time in which to consider this. I have to say that perhaps it only started being considered because of the scandal around the government, not because of the sexual harassment which is being experienced in workplaces right around Australia and which has been experienced since this report was tabled. It has happened in my own home state of WA. In Western Australia's mining industries, there have been allegations of rape and sexual harassmentâ€”events that have taken place since this report was tabled and that could have and should have been prevented. So I don't think it's any wonder that this government is still making excuses about assessing a duty of care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Plainly, this bill is worthwhile, but it is a face-saving device for a government that is weighed down by scandal and allegations against its own members. It has not done the due diligence to put a comprehensive package together before this place. Victims of sexual harassment and discrimination deserve so much better. The case for change and the path forward was very clearly put forward by Commissioner Jenkins, and this parliament has a responsibility to act on and implement her recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government sat on this report for over a year without responding and without the responsible minister meeting even once with the commissioner. Now we have a bill before us that implements only six of the 17 legislative recommendations that Commissioner Jenkins made, and, of those six, some are only a partial implementation of those recommendations. Implementing all the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report recommendations is entirely consistent with my commitment, the Labor leader's commitment and the Labor Party's commitment to achieving substantive equality between men and women in our nation. By doing this, we're making the legal and structural changes that enable power inequalities to be addressed in the community and in our workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the bill in this current form does not come even close to this objective. It doesn't implement recommendation 17, to insert a positive duty into the Sex Discrimination Act. It doesn't implement recommendation 28, to amend the Fair Work Act to expressly prohibit sexual harassment. It does not amend the Fair Work Act to provide all workers with access to 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave. It does not implement recommendation 23, to amend the Human Rights Commission Act to allow representative groups to bring representative claims to court. It does not implement recommendation 25, to amend the Human Rights Commission Act to insert a costs protection provision consistent with section 570 of the Fair Work Act. It does not provide broad and 'stop sexual harassment' orders to cover sex based harassment extending to any circumstances connected with work. And it does not amend the Sex Discrimination Act to achieve substantive equality between men and women as an objective for our nation. It does not implement recommendation 16b and 16c, to prevent the creation of hostile work environments. The bill says it has to be 'seriously demeaning'; you have to be subjected to seriously demeaning behaviour rather than just demeaning behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at what is left out of this bill, then you can see that this bill provides an advancement but no real protection for women from sexual harassment in their workplace. Why? Because, in order to raise a complaint and take it to court, you could be subjected to costs. When you get to court, you could end up debating whether the harassment that you were subjected to was seriously demeaning or just demeaning. Will it be credible enough to stick to a charge? Can you imagine debating the extent to which you've been demeaned by someone's behaviour? It is little surprise to me that so many stakeholders in the course of the Senate inquiry agreed with Commissioner Jenkins, who herself said to the inquiry this bill is not good enough and does not live up to what this nation needs to protect people from sexual harassment in their workplaces. The government has failed to address fundamental recommendations for reform. The bill still leaves intact reactive and adversarial regulatory systems that are, by this legislation, largely unchanged, and because of this the law will continue to fail to protect people in their workplaces from sexual harassment and behaviour from colleagues or bossesâ€”or even from customersâ€”that demeans them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Commission told the Senate inquiry that the introduction of a positive duty would be 'a powerful tool to promote broad systemic and cultural change that sits outside the current adversarial framework of discrimination law'. It's little wonder that so many submitters to the committee, and in the community, have hinged around every aspect of what Commissioner Jenkins recommended that is entirely absent from this bill. Those opposite have said we already have a duty of care in the Work Health and Safety Act. Well, Commissioner Jenkins said very explicitly in her submission on this legislation that the Work Health and Safety Act is not an adequate, substantive, proactive duty of care because it is not specific enough, and the Work Health and Safety Act is not perceived in those terms; it's not perceived in the terms of preventing discrimination and harassment. It's tied up in the vagaries of psychosocial hazards, which this government has admitted still need to be looked at and further reformed. And yet Australian women who are subject to sexual harassment in their workplace will again be abandoned by this government, which is failing to make these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Jenkins said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This would not impose an undue regulatory burden and would have a greater chance of reducing the cost of sexual harassment to business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the report she characterised the billions of dollars that this behaviour costs workplaces, the productivity effects and, undoubtedly, the incredible toll that it takes on those subject to this behaviour. Even employer groups like the Minerals Council agreed. When the Minerals Council CEO, Tania Constable, appeared before the Senate inquiry, she said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ given the significant issueâ€”</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and the failure of existing laws to adequately address the problemsâ€”</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">we support there being a positive duty in the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council supports it, Diversity Council Australia supports it, legal aid supports it and the Australian Discrimination Law Experts Group supports it. It seems entirely bizarre to me that this government has refused to include the introduction of the positive duty into this legislation. The right of workers to be free from sexual harassment is a human right, a workplace right and a safety right. I implore those opposite to amend the bill to support a positive duty in the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know others will speak to the importance of implementing other recommendations ignored by this government, but I want to speak to one other in this contribution: recommendation 23, which would address what the Australian Human Rights Commission identified as the 'chilling effect' of current regulatory regimes and the impact that has on victims-survivors taking action against perpetrators. The government rejected this recommendation without detailed reasoning, simply noting that there's an existing mechanism to enable representative proceedings in the Federal Court. I have to say: is the government living in the real world? The power dynamics that exist in Australian workplaces and that make workers extremely hesitant to even come forward and report sexual harassment, let alone go down the route of taking their employer to court, have been manifestly ignored by this government in the way that it has brought this bill forward and in all its public comments. This government is entirely out of touch with the experiences of victims. It has taken an enormous toll on them. They've left their jobs. They've lost income. In some cases, as I learned when I spoke to women during the course of the Senate inquiry, it has ruined their mental health and their financial future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I call on the government to fully implement the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report recommendations by amending the bill currently before the parliament. I condemn the government for its delay. Every day without action allows the scourge of sexual harassment in Australia's workplaces to continue. It is shameful that, in the legislation that is before us today, this government has failed to take real action to stop sexual harassment in Australia's workplaces.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  [by video link] I too rise to speak on the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. This is the government's response to the landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report on sexual harassment in Australian workplaces, so it is also their response to the one in three people, mostly women, who have experienced sexual harassment at work. These are women who have experienced great harm, have lost jobs and income and are still living with the long-term effects of their experiences. They are women who deserve and expect urgent action from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we have a response that has been described by experts as a missed opportunity and a failure, a half-hearted version of the substantial reforms that this crisis of sexual harassment deserves. It's a response that shows this government knows what needs to be done but is simply refusing to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report was groundbreaking, a world-first inquiry into workplace sexual harassment. It shone a giant spotlight onto the experiences of working women in this country, women who too often are made to endure damaging and traumatic harassment just on the basis of their gender. The personal stories in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report were a call for changeâ€”urgent change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of answering that call, this government chose to ignore the report. The Prime Minister and the former Attorney-General Mr Porter left it on their desks, ignored for over a year. For over a year, they refused to take action. They even refused to meet with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to discuss the report's recommendations. While they let this report gather dust, they spent their time defending their own reputations about the very behaviour that this report sought to uncover. They stood by as minister after minister and member after member was caught up in the various scandals and allegations that we know this government had to endure. They refused to take any serious action, to show any leadership and to make clear that sexual and sex based harassment is completely unacceptable in this country today. They refused to show leadership not just with words and spin but through real action and urgent change. It wasn't until tens of thousands of women took to the streets in the March4Justice protests that this government finally started to care. Finally, over a year after this urgent report was handed down, the new Attorney-General, Senator Cash, has responded. This is a government that is always dragged kicking and screaming to take action. Then, when they get there, they act with half-responses and half-measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: we absolutely welcome the opportunity to finally begin implementing the important and urgent recommendations of Commissioner Jenkins. But, as it stands, this bill is nowhere near enough. It is nowhere near strong enough to deliver the changes that the commissioner recommended. This bill fails to implement 14 of the 55 recommendations which would see women be safer at work. Labor's amendments will strengthen this bill in line with the recommendations of the report. Critically, our amendments will ensure that sexual and sex based harassment are properly addressed in workplaces. Labor have committed to implementing all 55 recommendations. That commitment goes further than just this bill. A Labor government will work with employers, workers, unions and legal experts to finalise and implement stronger laws as a matter of priority in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report clearly says that Australia's existing laws are out of date. They are failing to protect workers, and reform is urgently neededâ€”reform that this government has just not delivered. Labor's amendment to this bill seeks to introduce a positive duty on employers to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment from happening in the first place. This amendment acts on recommendation 17 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, a recommendation which is supported by both unions and employer bodies and which the government have ignored. Labor's amendment will ensure that employers have a duty to create and maintain safe workplaces, because we know that the cases that are reported are just the tip of the iceberg. It's not enough for employers just to react to complaints that are made; they need to actually take active measures in the first place to stop the harassment from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent inquiry into sexual harassment at mining sites in Western Australia revealed that BHP has taken disciplinary action and fired 48 workers in relation to inappropriate sexual behaviour in the past two years. But evidence from the Western Mine Workers Alliance showed that just four in 10 women FIFO workers felt encouraged to report that harassment in the first place, and half of them said workers are not supported through the reporting process. So we know that the incidences of sexual harassment that were acted on were just the tip of the iceberg and that there are many barriers to reporting sexual harassment. Insecure work is one. Fear of victimisation is another. Trauma and shame are others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking action against sexual harassment should not be reliant on the courage of the victim. Taking action against sexual harassment should mean stopping it before it actually starts. Positive duties would require employers to take reasonable and proportionate steps to prevent this harassment. This is what would really mark a shift from the current reactive model that relies on workers having the courage and the means to make complaints. We need to shift that model to a proactive model that requires employers to take initiative to create workplaces that are free from harassment. Importantly, these duties will require employers to consider all aspects of the workplace when taking those reasonable steps to prevent harassment from staff, from management and from customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 the union for retail and fast-food workers, the SDA, conducted a survey with the Human Rights Commission on the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment amongst its members. The survey found that one in three incidents of workplace sexual harassment experienced by members were perpetrated by customers. A young woman under the age of 18 said in her response to the survey:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">all the times I have been inappropriately touched or commented on, it has been by customers. I feel as if I can't tell them to stop because I don 't want to be rude to a customer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own time, before coming to the Senate, I was proud to stand with workers against sexual harassment in the hospitality sector. I heard so many stories from young women who were harassed, stalked and pinned against bars by customers, and they received absolutely no support from their management. A survey of hospitality workers at the time showed 90 per cent had experienced sexual harassment and 19 per cent had been sexually assaulted at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These young workers deserve to be safe at work and safe from harassment, whether that be from other employees, management or customers. It is employers who are responsible for making these workplaces safe. Indeed, many employers have signed up to zero-tolerance measures through the Respect is the Rule program in the hospitality sector, putting workers' rights to be safe over the assumption that customers are always right. The positive duty obligations in Labor's amendment will require employers to take action towards eliminating harassment from all areas of the workplace, including those customers. In order for the positive duty obligations to be effective, Labor's amendment will ensure that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner has the power to investigate and enforce compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a direct response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, but it is also a chance for the parliament to make further steps to improve women's safety. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report found that gender inequity is an underlying cause of sexual harassment. Recognising the unique experiences of women workers is an important step in reversing this inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the bill, the government has included the provision of compassionate leave for miscarriages. Labor unequivocally supports this change and acknowledges how impactful this will be on those who experience miscarriage. This is absolutely the right thing to do. In times of immense personal trauma, a person should not have to worry about losing pay or losing their job. They should be supported with paid leave to allow them time to process, and deal with, these deeply personal matters. We agree with this. We also believe this should extend to those experiencing domestic violence. That's why Labor's amendment to legislate 10 days paid domestic violence leave is also critically importantâ€”no-one should have to choose between their livelihood and their safety. This leave will allow workers who are facing domestic violence access to 10 days paid leave. That means they don't have to worry about their pay or job while they make the incredibly brave decision to get help or seek support. The government have acknowledged the need to address gender equality in workplaces through changes to leave entitlements, so supporting Labor's further amendment should be a no-brainer. Labor's amendments to this bill are about taking real action, because, as it stands, this bill is a slap in the face to workers who just want to feel safe and respected at workâ€”workers who deserve a prime minister and a government that will stand up for them and show leadership for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 55 recommendations made by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, this government is ignoring 14 critical recommendations. Women of Australia are struggling to believe the Prime Minister and his promises that he takes this issue seriously. It's not hard to see why: 40 per cent of women and 25 per cent of men have been sexually harassed at work in the last five years. Workplace sexual harassment is costing our economy $3.5 billion per year. Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins found that there is an urgency for change. The Morrison government has failed to meet this urgency, and it is failing Australian women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor understands this urgency. Only Labor will take the action needed to implement all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. If those across the chamber do not support our amendments to this bill, a Labor government will introduce stronger laws as a matter of priority.</span>

                    <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on this very important step forward. But it's a small step, this bill before us, the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021. This bill is a movement towards reform, but it is very limited and, ultimately, insufficient to address the moment that we are in. That said, it will still go a small way towards making Australia a little safer for Australians who are exploited in their workplace by sexual harassment, and it's time that something were done. I characterise it as a firm first step, but so much more needs to be done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is proposing to improve the strength of this bill and to seize this moment to make a change that will profoundly protect and improve the lives of Australian women and ensure that sexual harassment and sexual violence is crushed within a generation. We should not lose this moment. I note this unique historical moment that we are in. Thanks to the courage of some incredible women, our nation is finally having a long overdue conversation about society's treatment of women. But I also note that the recent statistics over the last five years reported in Commissioner Jenkins' report indicate that, while it's 40 per cent of women who are harassed, there is also an increase to 25 per cent of men who are experiencing sexual harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud Brittany Higgins and her courage in telling her story. Her brave stance catalysed a chain reaction that seared through every layer of Australian societyâ€”from powerful corporate boardrooms to political parties to the halls of this very building. The struggle of women for safe workplaces was put on the national agenda. Let me give the chamber some history on this bill. Initially, the first Me Too movement prompted the landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span> review set in motion by the former Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer in 2018. Conducted by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins, the report laid out 55 recommendations to make our institutions and our workplaces safer for women and cracked down on the scourge of violence and harassment that's been endemic for too long. I actually have the report with me. I don't how many people will be watchingâ€”I know more people listen across the country than watchâ€”but this is a substantial body of work. It is a very significant and careful investigation into the reality of living in Australia in our time and the sexual harassment that's going on in our workplaces. It's not something to be ignored. Those who are listening to the debate this evening, and perhaps tomorrow as well, should really be aware that the government commissioned this report. The government have this information. The government have the power to write the legislation. They have all the resources of government to create outstanding legislation in response to this outstanding work. But you'd have to say that, when faced with that opportunity, they squibbed it. They simply haven't taken the reins and moved us far enough along the journey towards a better Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will back the very important work of the commission, and, of course, we've made it clear that we support all 55 recommendations. That's a very different kind of support. It's authentic, genuine support that we're happy to be held accountable for. It contrasts significantly with the version of realityâ€”all announcement and pretty short on deliveryâ€”that we're experiencing with this Liberal and National Party government. There's the announcement; then there's the gap or, increasingly, the chasm; and then there's what actually gets done. That's what's happening with this piece of legislation as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Minister Porter kept this very important report locked away in his bottom drawer for over a year, gathering dust. So I do want to acknowledge that Senator Cash, having taken over the portfolio, has got on with the job, but I just wonder how much more might have been done and how much better a job this Australian parliament might have been able to achieve if the work necessary to govern well had actually been undertaken, instead of great reports like this being allowed to just sit off to the side with no response. The fact is that this could still have been sitting in Minister Porter's bottom drawer but for the course of history. It took an alleged rape in the ministerial wing for the government to finally come to its senses, blow the dust off the report and begin to implement the pieces of it that it liked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's be clear. This extensive, well-researched, well-prepared report was an opportunity to create very significant and lasting legislation to improve the life and wellbeing of the Australian people. When they finally got to blowing the dust off the report, what did they come forward with? A bill that will implement sixâ€”sixâ€”of those 55 recommendations: Nos 16, 20, 21, 22, 29 and 30. It's something, but there's absolutely no way that it's enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill as it stands will clarify the object of the Sex Discrimination Act. This will add a line to the 'Objects' section of the act so that, in addition to the elimination of discrimination and harassment, the act claims 'to achieve, so far as practicable, equality of opportunity between men and women'. The bill will also clarify an existing provision in the Sex Discrimination Act to ensure that it's unlawful to harass a person on the ground of their sex. This is necessary due to confusion regarding this provision in current case law. The bill will also expand protection significantly to cover all paid and unpaid workers, interns and volunteers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also cover previously excluded categories such as members of parliament, MOP staff and judges, and it will remove the current exemptions of state and territory public services from protections under the act. This is important given the context of this debate, and it would close a loophole that should never have been there in the first place. It shows, importantly, that this parliament is not above the law and that we must hold ourselves to the same standard as every other workplace in Australia. The standards need to be rising standards, not minimum, basic standards that continue the practices that are too much enmeshed in the culture of Australian workplaces. The work we do in this place is of national consequence, so there should be no reason at all why our workplace should be an unsafe place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also expands ancillary liability provisions so that people who cause, instruct, induce, aid or permit another person to engage in sexual harassment or sex based harassment can also be found liable for the unlawful conduct. It also clarifies where the federal courts can hear civil applications under the AHRC Act regarding victimisation. One of the most important reforms in this bill is to amend the AHRC Act so that the president will be unable to terminate a complaint on the grounds of time, until 24 months have passed. That's a 400 per cent increase in time. It's very necessary based on the evidence that we received. Certainly, from my own experience of sexual harassment, there's a period of trying to process what on earth happened to you. When you're harassed, it's such a shock because it's often by a person that is senior to you and a person that you trusted. You do the mind replay and think: did that really happen? And then there's the confronting of that and what might follow, including the emotional impediments to action, let alone the practical ones. It means that often there can be a significant delay before people come forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps Senator Cash has seen this, as one of the few women in a leadership position in this government: back in 2017, this government cut the time frame for people to bring forward a complaint. They cut it in half. It was a year and they took it back to only six months. We haven't seen great leadership over the period of this government, and, let's face it, these guys have been here for eight years and we have not seen good leadership. In a way, I suppose it's remarkable that there's been progressâ€”but not enough. So I endorse the increase in the time in which a complaint can happen to 24 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also give the Fair Work Commission the ability to make 'stop bullying' orders to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace. Other important reforms are also included in the bill, such as amending the Fair Work Act so that 'sexual harassment can be conduct amounting to a valid reason for dismissal'. Oh, my Godâ€”how many women wish that that had been the case prior to this legislation coming forward. It will also seek to enable an employee to take two days of compassionate leave if the employee or their partner has a miscarriage. Those are the worthy reforms that I identify in my contribution, but they barely scratch the surface of what needs to be done. As I said, implementing only six of the 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report is barely 10 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I participated in the inquiry regarding this bill and heard some very, very troubling evidence about the insufficiency of current Australian laws in dealing with the scourge of sexual harassment, and that's convinced me that the bill the government has presented does not adequately address the scale of the crisis. Additionally, there is the smorgasbord of disgusting evidence that's embedded in the report that reveals the ugly reality of sexual harassment in the workplace. When this very rushed inquiry was undertaken, Labor senators put forward a dissenting report and in that report we quoted Ms Julia Fox, the National Assistant Secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. She told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Working in retail and fast food, our members are also exposed to an increased risk of sexual harassment due to their customer-facing roles, with one in five members sexually harassed by a customer. The impact that sexual harassment on workers is profound. A quarter of our members who experienced sexual harassment said that it negatively impacted their employment, career opportunities, and work. Almost half of those who have been sexually harassed reported experiencing mental health issues as a result, with six per cent reporting they'd experienced suicidal thoughts and four per cent with PTSD. Employers need to recognise the health and safety impacts of sexual harassment in the workplace and take steps to ensure the workplace is safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that those comments may trigger some people who might be listening to this debate, and I encourage them to seek support from the mental health lines that are available to help us all when we find ourselves in a time of struggle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU's submission to the inquiry that looked at this piece of legislation found it inadequate and noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government's response to Respect@Work falls well short of what the Respect@Work Report says is necessary to prevent sexual harassment and other forms of gendered violence at work. The government's decision to refuse to take the actions recommended by Respect@Workâ€”an Inquiry commenced by themâ€”to end sexual harassment and other forms of gendered violence in Australian workplaces is unforgivable. Workers at Parliament House and countless other workplaces around the country who have had the courage to speak up about these injustices deserve much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an opportunity for those on the crossbench and the Greens senators to work with Laborâ€”and I encourage the government to give it consideration even at this late stage of the bill advancing through the Senateâ€”to make changes as outlined in the amendments that will be put forward by the Labor Party and to seize this moment, to take heed of the historical moment that we are in. Do not squib it. Do not lose the opportunity to make a bill that does a few things of import much better than it currently is. Give Australians the protection that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, spoke to the committee about the appalling rates of sexual harassment in the mining industry. She told us that workplace sexual harassment in the mining industry is notably higher, at 40 per cent, than the national prevalence rate of 33 per cent. The proportion of male perpetrators is higher, at 83 per cent, than the national average of 79 per cent. The likelihood of being sexually harassed by more than one person is higher. The mean number of perpetrators of sexual harassment in the mining industry is three, compared to 1.7 overall. There's so much more to say, and I look forward to continuing the debate, but this is a moment for an improved bill as we move through the next stages of consideration here in the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  [by video link] In March this year I joined thousands of angry Australian women. We'd had enough of the never-ending gendered violence, of horrific sexual assaults, of shocking allegations, of the abuse and violence perpetrated against women, especially here in the halls and offices of parliament. Australian women roared in March and we marched to say it was enough. We'd reached our line in the sand. We'd had enough of the appalling workplace culture in Parliament House and other workplaces and the continuing discrimination, continuing harassment and violence. I'm sickened that we still have people holding positions of leadership and authority in this parliament who are the subject of serious allegations and whose behaviour is the subject of serious questions. What sort of message does that send to women, particularly young women, about taking up positions of leadership and working here in this place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of women's lives, of our lives, is that we are surrounded every day by sexual violence. From the age of 15, one in two young women report being sexually harassed at work and almost two in five women have experienced sexual harassment in the last five years. But it's not just young women or working women facing this every day. Even when we're frail and elderly in aged care we're at risk of assault. One woman a week is killed by their current or former partner. The rates of violence, as we know, are even higher for First Nations women. From the youngest women to the oldest women, in our homes and in our workplaces, we live our lives surrounded by violence. We learn not to look at this full on, not to stare at this for too long, because it burns a hole in our hearts. We know all this. We've known this for lifetimes, and it's way past time to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am horrified but also frustrated and furious that there's been so much talk and so little real action. If we in the Senate and the other place, the lawmakers, cannot keep women safe and believe women then something fundamental has to change. The government seems incapable of taking action and of taking those bold steps. It's developed a small response to an overwhelming issue, a mediocre mumble to a full-throated demand from Australian women. This legislation, the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021, is so limited in its scope, exactly like the Morrison-Joyce government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, the national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces was announced, and that culminated in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report released by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins in March 2020. The report found that workplace sexual harassment in Australia is both prevalent and pervasive and that the current legal and regulatory system is insufficient to effectively address sexual harassment in the workplace. The report, through 55 recommendations, proposed widespread changes to how sexual harassment is handled in the workplace, including in relation to improving training, education and awareness in relation to respectful relationships, methods of reporting and initiatives around support, advice and advocacy. When handing down her report, the commissioner said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I call on all employers to join me in creating safe, gender-equal and inclusive workplaces, no matter their industry or size. This will require transparency, accountability and leadership.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, they're all attributes this Morrison-Joyce government does not possess. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is a weak response and a missed opportunity. Instead of taking the opportunity to commit to and implement all of the 55 recommendations in the groundbreaking <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, we have this response, which is nowhere near strong enough to deliver the legislative changes proposed by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. This legislation should be changing the Fair Work Act to explicitly prohibit sexual harassment. It should introduce a positive duty on employers to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment happening in the first place. It should make 'substantive equality between women and men' an objective. It should allow unions or other organisations to bring legal action against perpetrators on behalf of complainants. It should establish cost protections for complainants so that they aren't discouraged from taking legal action due to the possibility of having to pay massive court ordered legal costs. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report clearly says that Australia's existing laws are out of date, failing to protect workers and that reform is urgently needed. After commissioning the work in 2018, the Morrison government ignored the final <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report for a year, leaving it to gather dust on the desk of former Attorney-General Christian Porter. It should not have taken this long. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud that an Albanese Labor government will fully implement all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report to help keep Australians safe from sexual harassment at work. An Albanese Labor government will help keep Australians safe all the time. I'm even prouder of the commitment announced by Labor today that backs our promise and will see action to make women's lives better. Labor will commit around $24 million to ensure there are properly funded working women's centres in every Australian state and territory. That's what Labor will do. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Working women's centres provide free, confidential assistance and advice about workplace matters, including sexual harassment, wage theft and discrimination. Sadly, many working women's centres have cut back their services, have closed or have faced closure because of the federal Liberals' funding cuts. I have spoken here of the dire situation the NT Working Women's Centre is facing because of federal government cuts. In October the NT Working Women's Centre faces its cliff edge. It's only a little over a month away. Without a further funding commitment, it will have to substantially cut back its services to Territory women. There are only three working women's centres currently in existence in Australia, and, of these three, only one in South Australia has its future assured. </span>

The Northern Territory and Queensland centres were established in 1994 and the South Australian centre in 1979. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Working women's centres work primarily with women who are not represented by a lawyer or other advocate. These women are often economically disadvantaged and vulnerable and work in precarious areas of employment. Working women's centres assist with a broad range of workplace issues, such as gender discrimination, unfair dismissal, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and assault. They also conduct research and project work on a range of issues that women experience in relation to work, including on access to child care, family-friendly practices, the needs of First Nations working women, pregnancy and parental status discrimination, leave entitlements, work-life balance, pay equity and the impact of domestic violence on women workers and their workplaces. Additionally, they provide free and fee-for-service training for workers and employers about workplace rights on areas such as bullying, sexual harassment and domestic violence. The experience of working women's centres is that sexual harassment at work remains a persistent public health challenge, with implications for workplace safety and workers compensation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, the NT Anti-Discrimination Commission described sexual harassment as a significant and pervasive issue here in the Northern Territory. They pointed out the significant barriers that exist for NT women in a small jurisdiction. For example, if a woman works in a particular field, there may be only one employer in the Northern Territory where she can do that particular work, and speaking out may result in her losing her job and severely limit future employment prospects.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian governments provide increased and recurrent funding to working women's centres to provide information, advice and assistance to vulnerable workers who experience sexual harassment, taking into account particular needs of workers facing intersectional discrimination.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the government's <span style="font-style:italic;">A roadmap to respect</span> response to the report, they agreed with the recommendation and stated that they will engage with state and territory governments on funding for working women's centres. The Commonwealth government cut all federal funding to the Queensland and Northern Territory working women's centres in 2016 and again in 2020, and the centres are only managing to survive because of modest funding commitments from the Labor state governments. The shadow minister for industrial relations and the shadow minister for women wrote to the Attorney-General, the Minister for Women and the Minister for Women's Economic Security on 27 August, urging the Morrison government to provide urgent funding to ensure the NT Working Women's Centre does not close and to ensure there are properly funded working women's centres in all jurisdictions. I would like to acknowledge the shadow ministers' strong and ongoing support for the work of the working women's centres and particularly for the strong advocacy they've done to ensure the NT centre can keep its doors open. The government indicated, through Senate estimates, that they are negotiating with the states and territories on a joint funding arrangement for working women's centres to be established in all states and territories. This was welcome news, but it cannot be an excuse for the Morrison government to try and dodge responsibility and put this onto the states and territories.</span>

With the women's safety summit planned for next week, I have no doubt that the vital work of the working women's centres will again be highlighted. But time is running out for the NT Working Women's Centre. Women of the Northern Territory cannot afford for it to further reduce its services or, worse, to close its doors.</span>

The Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021 joins a long list of half-hearted attempts, complete failures, and instances of downright contempt for women's issues demonstrated by the Liberal government since its election, and particularly by this Prime Minister, Mr Morrison. In 2016, when Mr Morrison was Treasurer, he cut $35 million from community legal centres, which provide vital support to women and family violence survivors. The National Association of Community Legal Centres has said that 160,000 people were turned away due to funding cuts. As Prime Minister, Mr Morrison completely defunded the National Family Violence Prevention and Legal Services Forum, the peak body representing First Nations survivors of domestic abuse. Ironically and callously, the group lost their funding on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Just a few months agoâ€”in June, in factâ€”Mr Morrison allowed Mr Barnaby Joyce to join the cabinet group Mr Morrison had formed to improve outcomes for women. This women's safety and security task force has been blasted as a farce, with Mr Joyce as a member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will move many amendments to strengthen this bill, including to provide for domestic violence leave. Who could forget the assertions made by Minister Cash, as employment minister, when she rejected calls for domestic violence leave, claiming instead that it would be a barrier to women getting a job and it would act as a perverse disincentive for employers to employ women? As employment minister she ignored or was completely ignorant of the fact that there are many current enterprise bargaining agreements where unions have successfully negotiated domestic violence leave and there are hundreds of employers who support it. We will see in this debate whether Minister Cash has changed her tune.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last December, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner June Oscar released the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wiyi Yani U Thangani: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span style="font-style:italic;">omen</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s </span><span style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span style="font-style:italic;">oice</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> report. It is a landmark report. It is the first in 34 years, following the 1986 <span style="font-style:italic;">Women's business</span> report. Commissioner Oscar held open meetings across the country to hear from women and girls. What has the governmentâ€”or, indeed, the Prime Minister or the Minister for Women in this placeâ€”done about this report? Absolutely nothing. They have not even acknowledged its existence. The report provides guidance to the Commonwealth government on measures that can be taken to effectively address the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and girls. The failure of the Morrison government to acknowledge this report completely misses the opportunity to include some of its recommendations in the bill before the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are, of course, Mr Morrison's personal failures: his disgraceful management of recent sexual assault allegations in this parliament, particularly when he revealed he'd asked his wife about what he should do in relation to the Ms Higgins matter. This was followed by his failure and his refusal to talk to thousands of protesters outside the parliament. Most of these protestors were women, and along with many of my Labor caucus members I went out and joined the protest. Then there has been the complete protection of the member for Pearce against the allegations of historical rape. Mr Morrison has steadfastly refused to investigate that matter, admitting he has not even read the allegations against Mr Porter. The Prime Minister could have taken his lead from the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, Susan Kiefel, who did investigate and found against Justice Hayden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians feel the Prime Minister has not done enough to listen to or protect women, and this bill before the Senate is another clear indication of that. There was, of course, his now forgotten mea culpa, an admission of error that he had failed to get the timing right on the marginalisation, the trivialisation, the harassment and the sexual assault of women. That acknowledgement of failing to get the tone right is long gone. Actions speak louder than words, and this bill before the Senate is further acknowledgement that the Prime Minister has no intention of getting it right. After commissioning the national inquiry in 2018, Mr Morrison ignored the final <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, ignored it for over a year. It was only after all of the disgraceful sexual harassment and rape allegations in this place that the Prime Minister resurrected the report, which had been gathering dust on the desk of the former Attorney-General, the member for Pearce, Mr Porter. It should never have taken this long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is very basic. It fails to implement all of the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. It well and truly lets women down. The report tells us that two out of every five women have experienced sexual assault at work. That's a significant number of the women in this place. Failing to act on the Jenkins recommendations does not build much confidence that Mr Morrison will act on the recommendations of the inquiry the government has charged the commissioner to hold into the culture of this workplace. If Mr Morrison won't act to prevent sexual harassment in Australian workplaces, it doesn't seem likely that he will hold his government to a higher standard. The government has shown disregard and disrespect for Australian women time and time again. This bill was an opportunity to get it right, but it falls well short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workplace sexual harassment is prevalent and pervasive. It occurs in every industry, in every location and at every level in Australian workplaces. Australians across the country are suffering the financial, social, emotional, physical and psychological harm associated with sexual harassment, and this is particularly so for women. The behaviour also represents a very real financial impost to the economy, through lost productivity, staff turnover and other associated impacts, with workplace sexual harassment estimated to cost the Australian economy around $3.5 billion a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry also found that most people who experience sexual harassment never report it. I'd suggest that most women in this place know this, because, if they haven't experience sexual harassment in the workplace, their friends and/or their family have. This is something women discuss amongst ourselves, but, sadly, we rarely report it. It's often done by one person to another and it's very hard to prove, but we all know someoneâ€”or many womenâ€”who has experienced sexual harassment. Women don't report it, because they fear it will have an impact on their reputation and career prospects. They fear they won't be believed. They fear they'll be embarrassed. They fear because they've seen over and over again that the perpetrator will simply get off with a slap on the wrist or perhaps won't be questioned at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, back in April, Mr Morrison made a flashy announcement promising he would adopt every recommendation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. I remember watching him say those words. But, as usual with Prime Minister Morrison, it was all spin. In reality the Morrison government is refusing to implement a number of the major legislative reforms recommended by Commissioner Jenkins. The Morrison government has also failed to take action or has tried to pass off responsibility to the statesâ€”something we see in this place every dayâ€”on a number of the other key recommendations, including recommendations 25, 27, 28, 49 and 50. I'll bet you any money you like that government senators in this place will stand up and say the government is fully implementing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, so let's put it on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>that they're not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has not adopted recommendations 17 and 18, which place a positive duty on all employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation as far as possible. Over the last two or three months, in Western Australia, we've had an inquiry going on in the state parliament, looking at sexual harassment in the mining sector. Sadly, it came about because a woman was raped, and those matters are before the courts. Since that time, a number of other women have come out and made rape allegations against workmatesâ€”just think about that for a few seconds. I've no doubt that, if the government was actually real about implementing the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Respect@Work</span> report and actually did introduce a positive duty on employers to prevent sexual and sex based harassment, it would make a world of difference in the mining sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, what we've seen the mining sector come up with is all these punitive measures. Yes, we do need punitive measuresâ€”people should lose their jobs if they're found to have engaged in sexual harassment, and of course they should face criminal charges if they have engaged in rapeâ€”but there is a requirement for the employers in the mining sector to do a little more than provide a wet mess and a gym. If they had a positive duty of care they would need to engage with their workforce and talk to them about the sorts of things that make a workplace better and safer. The reality is that in Western Australia those swings are long. They're 12 hour days, 14 days in a row. This is a long time to be away from your family, and it's a long time to allow negative workplace cultures to develop. So that is a major flaw in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago, I held a meeting in Western Australia and our shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, came and talked to that groupâ€”well, she Zoomed in, obviously. Ms Plibersek described the legislation as really important and went on to say: 'You wouldn't be allowed to work in a workplace where there was live electricity and you wouldn't be able to work in a workplace where there was asbestos falling on the ground, but in Australia you can work in a workplace which is unsafe because there is sexual harassment.' But, sadly, we see that this legislation is another example of spin over substance from a government big on talk and pathetic on delivery. If you want to see what a total failure of national leadership looks like, it is this legislation that is currently before the Senate and the weasel words that go with it. It is an absolute missed opportunity and another refusal by the Prime Minister to take action on a problem right in front of him and he then tries to pass it off as something else.</span>

It shows us that the wage gap between men and women in this country is only getting worseâ€”and it's getting worse under the leadership of this Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison. If there were ever a Prime Minister that was bad for women, this is itâ€”this government and this Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. When he is confronted with the facts and with the difficult issues, he always finds a way of blaming everybody else. He never takes responsibility; it's always someone else's fault or he wasn't toldâ€”or he didn't bother to read the documentation.</span>

Brittany Higgins is a hero; Brittany Higgins is one of the strongest women I have ever met in my life. She was sexually assaulted, allegedly in this building, in a ministers officeâ€”and we have been told that people very close to the Prime Minister knew.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise this evening to make some remarks about cryptocurrency. It is remarkable that one in five Australians have exposure to cryptocurrency, according to various surveys. This is a phenomenon which may not be well understood by legislators. Certainly, there was a debate in the US Senate just a couple of weeks ago on this exact question, and I think one of the senatorsâ€”it may have been Senator Cruzâ€”made the remark that only two or three of the US senators really had any sense of what cryptocurrency is. I'd say it's probably fair enough to apply that here, including to myself, but cryptocurrency is something that has taken hold with younger generations. It appears to me that, as it is a $1 trillion industry now, we want to be doing all we can to ensure that Australia and Australians can get the most benefits that they can from digital assets and cryptocurrency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: what are the benefits of these new innovations and changes? The answer is 'more efficiency', which is perhaps quite boring, but in a real sense it is also 'more choice and more competition', in particular with traditional financial services providers, where for decades we've seen banking oligopolies and the like taking hold. We could see cryptocurrency and digital assets breaking down the barriers to competition, so that people can have more choice in running their own affairs. One of the interesting things that I've learned in studying this sector is that younger people want to do banking and finance differently to their parents. They want to have more control. They want to have a say. Decentralised finance, I think, presents really interesting opportunities for us to break down some of the longstanding traditions in Australia where we've seen too much power in the hands of too few. The opportunity for Australia, in terms of choice, is clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity for jobs is also very clear. I have to say, I've been blown away by how many jobs this industry has already created in my home state of New South Wales for people who are working at cryptocurrency exchanges and the like. There seem to be dozens of these companies employing 40 or 50 people, and they're managing a lot of assets, so we want to make sure that there is a proper framework around this industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we don't have regulatory arbitrage, where on one side you have a heavily regulated financial sector and then on the other you have a totally unregulated sector with people doing very similar things. We want to make sure that there is consumer protection in this space, but we also want to make sure that we are incentivising investment. If there is a $1 trillion sector out there, we want to make sure that we're getting as much as possible of that benefit, in terms of investment and jobs, into our country. After all, we have a safe jurisdiction. The laws here are certain. So we should be looking to have policies and laws which are at least as good as those of Singapore, the UK and the US. Certain US states have already passed very detailed laws to deal with digital assets and cryptocurrency, which is attracting investment, jobs and new choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to be a fast mover here. It has taken a long time to enact changes to our companies law to incentivise more investment in certain parts of the finance sector. Certainly, we can't wait decades to put in place new laws to protect investors and incentivise investment in this cryptocurrency space. The trade-off here for us as a country is exactly that: how do we protect consumers, who are already widely using these assetsâ€”one in five Australians, according to some surveysâ€”and, equally, ensure that we capture that investment and those jobs, in places like Sydney in particular? We are competing with Singapore, we are competing with London and we will compete with states like Wyoming in the US, which have passed detailed laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where to from here? There's a Senate committee, which I'm chairing, that is looking at this in detail. We will come back by October with a plan to deal with cryptocurrency and digital assets, which will look at markets and custody. It will look at the tokens and the tax settings, and it will put forward a plan that can put Australian digital assets and cryptocurrency at the top of the heap, certainly in our time zone. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise to speak about one element of the jobs crisis that has been created by the Morrison Liberal government's failure to maintain a uniform national wage subsidy scheme. The ham-fisted, alphabet-soup approach to disaster payments adopted by the Morrison government since the premature end of JobKeeper has meant that many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians have been left without income support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, they have also been treated differently depending on the state they live in. Last week, it was reported in Tasmania's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mercury</span> newspaper: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The number of airport workers stood down due to flight cancellations across Tasmania has climbed from 30 to 100 as border closures continue to hurt the tourism sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the income of 100 workers in Tasmania gone because Mr Morrison's Liberal government has steadfastly refused to provide support and assistance to those who are direct casualties of his inept ability to provide a robust quarantine system that works and a vaccine rollout comparable to the rest of the developed world. Not a single one of these 100 impacted workers are eligible for Mr Morrison's aviation support package, yet these are workers in the aviation sector who've been stood down and lost their income because of the direct impact of the border closures and lockdowns brought on by this government's failures. That was meant to be the point of the aviation assistance packageâ€”to support these very workers. If that wasn't meant to be the point, what was? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do workers across Australia continually have to suffer because Mr Morrison refuses to admit he got it wrong with the early axing of JobKeeper? The failure to provide support to workers in this sector will have an ongoing flow-on effect, for many months to come, on businesses that rely on visitation to Tasmania, even after border restrictions are eased. This is due to an exodus of skilled and accredited aviation ground-operations staff, without whom Tasmania will be unable to handle an increased volume of air traffic. This is a looming supply chain failure brought about purely by the Morrison Liberal government's inept intransigence. I commend the Labor member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell, for continuing to raise the plight of these workers and for seeking to have this important matter addressed on behalf of them and the many Tasmanian businesses their critical work supports. I urge Mr Morrison to admit he's got it wrong and provide the necessary support to these workers to keep our aviation industry going for the long term. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us be clear: it is not just aviation support ground staff who are suffering. We are seeing workers in other airport services, like food vendors and car hire companies, being stood down as well. Beyond our airports, we're seeing our accommodation providers, hospitality venues, restaurants, cafes, pubs, tourism operators and so many more suffering from a significant and sustained reduction in visitation. This is a burgeoning crisis that many businesses will struggle to recover from. That is why Tasmania's Labor members of federal parliament wrote to the Prime Minister some weeks ago urging him to reinstate broader financial support for workers and businesses impacted by border restrictions. The chorus of support for these necessary measures has only grown louder since. As quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Sunday Examiner</span>, tourism operator and publican at the Duke of Wellington Hotel in Hobart Douglas O'Neil said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We've seen a massive drop in revenue. There's just no tourists coming in. Three weeks ago I woke up and cried looking at my bank statement because I didn't know how I was going to pay staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many others, Mr O'Neil has said the paltry, one-off grants currently available would not even cover a week of wages or rental costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for action was yesterday, but, if Tasmanian workers and businesses are to survive to see the other side of this crisis, they need support today. Tasmanians can see the downturn on the streets. Whether it's the abysmally low patronage of Hobart's iconic Salamanca Market and what that means for the many hundreds of stallholders, the low number of diners at our restaurants or the friends and families we know who've had their rosters cut and shifts dropped, this downturn is having a real-world impact. The Prime Minister pledged last year that he would build a bridge to get Australians safely to the other side of this crisis. It seems that this Prime Minister struggles to keep promises about the construction of not only physical bridges but also metaphorical ones. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise tonight to focus on a tragedy that is happening on the streets of Perth: recently, there have been a number of deaths of First Nations women experiencing homelessness on Perth's streets. In the heart of Perth's CBD, four Aboriginal women died on the streets in less than four weeks, over the coldest months of winter. On 18 June, a young Noongar mother who dreamt of being the next Cathy Freeman, Alana Garlettâ€”and I have permission to use her nameâ€”died in Royal Perth Hospital after being found unresponsive outside the Wesley Uniting Church on Hay Street in the CBD. In the two weeks after her death, three more Noongar women died within a couple of hundred metres of that same spot. On the same freezing night a vigil was held for Alana at state parliament, on 4 August, another young woman was found in Yagan Square. The following week, another woman died outside the Perth train station, and then another young woman was found unresponsive in the CBD the following night. That's four deaths in less than a month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At least one woman has died on Perth streets every week this winter, after 56 people died while homeless in Perth in 2020. These women are dead due to WA's housing crisis, which governments have overseen. Noongar elder Vanessa Culbong is an aunt to one of the women who died and is herself homeless. She is a respected activist within the Noongar community, and she recently said: 'This is all a product of a system that's failed us and continues to fail us. We can't see a light at the end of the tunnel when women and birth-givers are dying in front of us. We bring these people into the world and we have to watch them die, with no-one being held accountable and no justice being given to us. We feel like we are digging our own graves, and the homelessness sector has to be held accountable too. We present ourselves at services, and we face an obstacle course with no end in sight. People are getting desperate and talking about doing things that shouldn't be spoken about in one of the richest countries in the world. How can we deal with any of our social issues if we don't have the foundation firstâ€”housing?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Betsy Buchanan OAM is a legendary advocate for Aboriginal people who has worked for years with Aboriginal families in Perth to help them advocate for housing and generate political pressure for policy solutions to end homelessness. She has described these deaths as 'Perth's own pandemic, claiming the lives of at least one of our people every week this winter'. She recently said: 'We are completely overwhelmed with families calling all day, from early in the morning. So many of these destitute families are calling for help burying their children, which costs thousands of dollars they don't have. Others are demanding accommodation before they become the next death, desperately ill people discharged from ICUs and hospital straight back to the street. They are angry and embittered because there are so many deaths. People are terrified that they will be next. Their loved ones keep dying. This is a total crisis.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While everyone has been focusing on COVID, and rightly so, more lives have been lost in Western Australia from homelessness than from the pandemic. We need to look at this as well as the current pandemic. The colossal failure by all levels of government, both nationally and the state government of WA, to focus on vulnerable First Nations women is shameful. I cannot believe that we're seeing young Noongar women literally dying on the streets of the richest, safest state in the world. It is unacceptable. My heart goes out to the families of these women and to those of the 56 who died on WA's streets last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The solution is urgent investment in more social and affordable housing and specialist homeless services, things the government have all but abandoned both here and in Western Australia. We need to see a significant input into this issue in the upcoming state budget. How many more women do we need to lose in Perth before governments, both state and federal, recognise the dire situation that we and First Nations women are facing in this country?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the pathetic failure, in fact, of the Treasurer Mr Frydenberg to adequately protect Australian consumers. The Treasurer has once again missed another deadline for implementation of a crucial reform recommended by the Hayne royal commission. What could be more important, more crucial, than ensuring that consumers scammed by companies are able to access restitution? I'm talking of course about the Compensation Scheme of Last Resortâ€”long promised by this government, but still not delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government that voted 26 times against a banking royal commission, and it's still slow-walking its recommendations, or even jettisoning them completely. As we've seen with the attempted repeal of the responsible lending laws, the coalition government is unwilling to legislate to protect Australian financial services consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A small delay is understandable, given the pressures of COVID-19, but this is just another example of the Treasurer kicking the necessary and promised reform into the long grass for another six months. This is the second time that this particular reform, which consumer group Choice called the most important recommendation of the banking royal commission, has been delayed by six months. It just cannot continue to be kicked off into the long grass. There is no reason for delay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year, more Australians than ever took out superannuation savings from their funds. Some of them were forced to use additional financial products to attempt to make ends meet during this recession. Yet, despite their efforts and their need to use financial products, they have no recourse to financial compensation if the regulator looking after this sector finds that these Australians were actually given misleading advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delay by this government has real-world effects. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> reported in June that AFCA have had to pause work on cases for one reason: until Mr Josh Frydenberg finalises this Compensation Scheme of Last Resort, AFCA can't do their work. AFCA are turning people away at the door because, in the words of their spokesman:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">AFCA did not feel it was right to ask consumers to invest considerable time and energy in pursuing such matters until it was clear there was a prospect that they may be paid compensation if awarded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC reported that 620 Australians have been asked to wait indefinitely for access to financial compensation until the Treasurer decides to get his act together. This is appalling governance. What we see constantly from those oppositeâ€”these are interactions that I hear about through my officeâ€”is that people go to their local member and they say, 'I've got this financial product problem,' and they get the standard response: 'Off you go; go to AFCA and they'll help you.' Yet the reality is that the Treasurer's inaction by sitting on his hands is preventing those people from getting the recourse that they deserve so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice delayed is justice denied. Australians, who the regulator has ruled have been dudded by misleading financial advice and products, aren't able to access financial compensation because the government just hasn't bothered to legislate the appropriate frameworks. Now these victims of financial crime may not see a cent until 2022, and many of them have already been waiting years for just compensation. I can't think of a time of more heightened financial pressure for so many people than right now, as COVID is escalating in its impact through our economy, our families, our communities, our small businesses in particular, and amongst those who have invested in financial products who have a right to expect that the government regulates the sector that they're responsible for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's had plenty of time on its hands. It found time to attack the super industry, the one sector that actually came out of the Hayne royal commission unscathed, yet it cannot find the energy or the heart to get everyday battlers the compensation they deserve. It's a searing indictment of the heartlessness and lack of direction of the Morrison government. Minister Frydenberg cannot delay this reform any longer. I call on him to give the people what they were promised: a compensation scheme of last resort.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  [by video link] Overnight, the last US troops in Afghanistan flew out of Kabul. The Afghanistan conflict has been Australia's longest military commitment, a war repeatedly endorsed by this parliament and a war that has ended with an ignominious collapse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no great secret as to why we went into Afghanistan in the first place. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, Prime Minister John Howard invoked article 5 of the ANZUS treaty, the first time that provision had ever been invoked. We sent our special forces and the RAAF to Afghanistan as part of an international campaign against al-Qaeda. First and foremost, it was a down payment on the ANZUS treaty and the US security guarantee that comes with it for this country. Over time, however, the rationale for our military efforts evolved. The shift can be discerned from the statements made by Australian government ministers as the years and, indeed, decades went by. In August 2002, for example, Minister for Defence Robert Hill declared:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The focus is shifting away from destroying concentrations of al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan â€“ a job now almost complete â€“ to tracking down any remnants and preventing them from regrouping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, Labor Minister for Defence Joel Fitzgibbon declared that Australia's military efforts were committed to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ ensuring that a tyrannical regime which provides safe haven for terrorists cannot take hold in Afghanistan again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2009, Minister for Defence John Faulkner said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the challenge is to ensure we see the Afghan national security forces able to take responsibility, full responsibility for security and stability in the province. That's when the job is done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that Australia would not abandon Afghanistan. That's rightâ€”we would never abandon Afghanistan. In February 2012, Minister for Defence Stephen Smith declared that we were on track to transition to Afghan-led responsibility for the Afghan national security forces by 2014. In the seven years since 2014, a lot more blood and treasure were spent in Afghanistan, but to no avail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that Australia should have left Afghanistan much earlier. Our political leaders should have acknowledged the deeply corrupt nature of the Afghan government. Corruption was the cancer that destroyed the regime in Kabul. The patient was always on life support, as billions of dollars of assistance was wasted. Once President Trump took office, the writing was on the wall. The US no longer had the will to continue fighting. The cost was too high, and Afghanistan was not actually very strategically important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, in a speech to the Senate in October 2019, I called for the Australian government to quickly wind down its military commitment in Afghanistan and Iraq. I said then that, given the current state of flux in American policy and erratic character of decision-making in Washington, there was an urgent need for Australia to look closely at current Middle East operations and ask some very searching questions about the risks involved in our long-term strategic interest. I further argued that we were unquestionably entering a new era of competition between major powers focused on East Asia and the Pacific, and, in those circumstances, Australia must face significant strategic challenges closer to home; that was where our national interest lay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was in October 2019. But the government sat on its hands, mired in political inertia and unwilling to do anything in advance of the United States. Then, when the United States did begin to pull the plug, our government moved with indecent haste, abruptly pulling out our remaining troops and shutting our embassy in Kabul. Hundreds of Afghans who had helped our forces were left at risk. Had we begun an orderly drawdown of forces two years ago, we would not have seen the shambles of recent weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Are there lessons to be learned from all this? Absolutely there are. After 20 years of conflict, we need a fully empowered inquiry into Australia's war in Afghanistan. There should be an independent inquiry carried out by independent Australian experts, with full access to all relevant government records, cabinet papers, military assessments, operational reports and intelligence files. Of course, there's little appetite for such an inquiry from either the coalition government or Labor, so this might prove to be a task for future historians. Fortunately, the cabinet papers for 2001 will be available for public access next year. We will have to see just how much will be redacted on the dubious grounds of national security. Meanwhile, we should remember that those who ignore and fail to understand the past are often condemned to repeat it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise tonight to make some brief comments in relation to Senator Rachel Siewert. This is her final week in the chamber, and, although I want to actually disagree with so many of the comments that were made last week after her valedictory speech, I'm actually speaking from a different perspectiveâ€”that of the class of 2005. The year 2005 was a great year. We had a lot of senators elected at that time, but, unfortunately, of those, the only ones still remaining in the chamber are Senator Glenn Sterle and me, with Rachel leaving this week. We did adopt a couple of stragglers, like Senator Carol Brown and Senator Connie Fierravanti-Wells, and the reason we embraced them so warmly was that I had introduced a system whereby we would collect money from the class of 2005 to add to the coffers of the Senate staff Christmas party. So, when we were all talking about all the great things that Rachel has done since she has been in this place, let's get down to tin tacks, to what we all come back down to, and that is: money! We are going to lose Rachel's contributionsâ€”even though there were times when I really did have to chase her, and I think her office at times got sick of me ringing and saying, 'Come on, Rach!' But, sincerely, I just want to put on the record that she was able to come in and serve this place with a distinction that I think has been noted across the chamber with respect for Rachel's contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the first inquiry where I travelled with Rachel. We went to Central Australia. It was the petrol-sniffing inquiry with the Community Affairs References Committee, and that was an eye-opener for me, because I hadn't been to Central Australia and I certainly hadn't had experience of First Nations communities to the same extent as Rachel Siewert obviously had. So I found her to be a good educator. And the thing that I have found with my work with her over many yearsâ€”through community affairs, mostlyâ€”has been her compassion and her strength of respect for the witnesses and the people who come before us. We did actually endure some really tough inquiries during that time. Some of them were on life issues on which Rachel and I are polar oppositesâ€”most of the time, I might add. But, unlike others who are on that committee, I can truly say that Rachel actually showed dignity and respect for people who had a different view to her. I think when I first met her, when we had our induction class for new senators, it was: 'Who is this little pocket rocket?' And I have to say that she really grew to warrant that nickname from me. Sometimes I'd actually refer to her as a terrier, but it was always with fond regard. To go back to the sort of committee work that we did: that translated into estimates, and I have to put on the record here tonight that we worked so well together in community affairs, particularly when I was the shadow assistant minister for aged care, and the way that she would allow me to take the running on the issues around aged care and around dementia did not go unnoticed. She has the same passion to see the changes as I have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that she's spoken about her sadness at leaving this place when she hasn't achieved as much as she would have liked to in a whole range of areas, including climate change, but I think also, like me, she would have a heavy heart to be leaving knowing that there's still so much to be done in the aged-care sectorâ€”so much reform; more investmentâ€”as well as in disability services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of what's left of the class of 2005, I want to wish Rachel all the very best for the new chapter in her life. She's going to get the opportunity to spend time with her family and to do some surfing and the like. As with everyone who serves in this place, it's our families and our partners and friends who allow us to be here and do the job we were elected to do. So, again, all the very best, Rachel, to you and your family, and I wish you every success in your future endeavours. I have no doubt, and I wouldn't mind betting, that you'll be back in front of a committee sometime in the future, giving evidence and certainly lobbying. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, Assistant Minister for Women and Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I rise to talk about an uncomfortable but important subject. It's the harm that exposure to pornography is doing to our children. When a committee of this parliament examined the issue, it found that with young people's growing and widespread access to digital platforms, often outside adult supervision, the exposure of children to violent and extreme pornography was a matter of great concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of adults who testify to the life-destroying harm of the unrealistic portrayals they see in pornography is large and growing, but, for the developing minds of primary-schoolers and teenagers, the facts are plain disturbing. There is a large and growing body of national and international evidence that shows children and young people who view porn suffer impaired social development, damaged mental health and stunted psychological development. The flow-on impact of the early sexualisation of children and the increase in child-on-child sexual assault and violence is just as severe. The former can lead to low self-esteem, lifelong problems of body image, eating disorders and poor emotional and cognitive development. They manifest in more serious conditions like depression, anxiety, promiscuity and sexual delinquency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't deny this stuff has real consequences. Teachers report primary-schoolers attempting what can only be described as sexually abusive acts on one another as they mimic what they've seen in pornography. High-school girls speak with embarrassment about the pressure they face to engage in acts and to provide explicit images and videos. The consequences are seen in the injuries with which adolescents in particular present in our emergency roomsâ€”everything from the impacts of choking through to tearing and prolapse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pornography damages children. It warps their perception of healthy interactions with one another, their expectations and their own relationships as they grow. It teaches a destructive, depersonalised, violent and frequently degrading view of sexuality and it corrupts the notion of consent. At a time when we've never been more aware of the harms of domestic violence, when we have never invested more public money in combating intimate partner violence, why are so few people willing to confront, frankly, the connection that exists with pornography? The testimony of those working at the frontline of domestic violence services shows the truth. Di McLeod, who's a director of a DV centre on the Gold Coast, puts it this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the past few years we have had a huge increase in intimate partner rape â€¦ The biggest common denominator is consumption of porn by the offender. With offenders not able to differentiate between fantasy and reality â€¦ oblivious to injuries caused and never ever considering consent. We have seen a huge increase in deprivation of liberty, physical injuries, torture, drugging, filming and sharing footage without consent. â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the edited, less traumatic version of her quote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adults should be able to make their own decisions about whether they access pornography, but children simply don't have the capacity to deal with this kind of content. Some people say parents should supervise better, and to an extent that's true, but it's hard to watch them all the time, particularly in the era of mobile phones and tablets. But there are things we can do. We can explore verification of whether a person is 18 before they access this stuff. It is a sensitive issue, though, because I expect adult users would be uncomfortable with the idea, albeit false, that the government is collecting a list of porn users. Age verification could be done without requiring a big government database, much like when you buy something from Dan Murphy's, but the international experience of implementing a system of this kind is that it can be technically complex, particularly given many of these websites aren't based in Australia. We should learn from the experience of the UK struggling to implement this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another option: we could require internet service providers to offer filtering of explicit content to their customers. It's a solution that empowers parents, respects the freedom of adults and doesn't require a complex regulatory scheme. Something like this is now in place in the UK and up to 40 per cent of customers, depending on the ISP, have chosen to opt in. Importantly, it's not a mandatory filter of the kind suggested by Senator Conroy some years ago; it must be voluntary for it to fairly balance the important objective of protecting children with the rights and freedoms of adults. I encourage the industry to step up and do what's needed to protect our children from this evil material.</span>
