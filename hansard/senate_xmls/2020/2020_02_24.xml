                  </a>  I just want to take the opportunity to put on the record some of the issues that we've been having in relation to private senators' bills and the listing of particular bills. Since the establishment of the 46th Parliament, we've had informal discussions around how this should be handled amongst parties, really around the time frame for introduction of bills and then debate. The informal agreement is that there should be enough time that elapses that parties are able to go through their own internal processes to agree to or to get positions on particular private senators' bills prior to them being listed. We have had some issues in the past. With the two bills listed to be debated today, the Labor Party haven't been allowed to go through our processes. Our first opportunity to discuss these bills will be tomorrow. But we do appreciate—I sincerely appreciate—the effort that Senator Siewert went to with her colleagues and Senator Ruston last week when this was identified, in resolving it so that these bills will be debated today but will not proceed to a vote, which will allow us to take them through our processes. But we would like to ensure that other crossbench members are aware of this in the listing of bills, and perhaps there will be an opportunity for whips to discuss this informally and reach agreement. Probably even better would be that parties are advised by the government of what bills are going to be listed prior to the motion being moved here on the Thursday morning. That would assist as well. We'd just like to place that on the record and ensure that today's debate goes ahead smoothly but without us being put in a position where we have to cast a vote on a bill that hasn't been through our party room.</span>

We had discussed it previously. Of course, the timing of private business has changed from our previous routine. We acknowledge that this week it was unfortunate in the way it worked out, but this morning, at whips, we did discuss this. We have reconfirmed the process, and now we'll pull a week forward when we place bills on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. The government did commit, when we were discussing it, to draft a note about it, and we also committed that we would inform the rest of the crossbench. I appreciate the comment that the opposition has made. It is being dealt with, and we will commit to that process. But I do also thank the opposition and the government for the way that we resolve this current private members' time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020—the Greens' bill that looks to introduce a climate trigger impact assessment into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, otherwise known as the EPBC Act. Now is the time for action. The world's leading climate scientists have told us we have a little over 10 years to cut our emissions in half. We have to get on with the job. Instead, of course, what we're seeing is emissions continuing to rise rapidly. We need a rapid transition to renewable energy. Australia's emissions keep going up and we've got to do everything we can to get them to come down. This bill is about trying to make sure things don't get worse. We have got a lot of work to do to reach the levels that the scientists are advising to reduce our pollution. The last thing we should be doing is making that job harder. That's what this bill strives to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that is effectively asleep at the wheel. When the country burns—as it has over this summer—when thousands of properties are lost, dozens of people are killed and over a billion animals die, and when economists estimate that the cost to the Australian economy of this summer's bushfires could reach as high as $1 billion, this government needs to stop acting as it is. We need to ensure that we reduce carbon pollution and that we have a plan to address climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of Australia's climate fires over this summer is over 250 million tonnes of CO2. That is a conservative estimate of what is being released into the atmosphere. We know the job to reduce climate change is already getting harder, day by day. We have a government with its head in the sand, asleep at the wheel, insisting that technology, not real reform, is going to be enough. We need to put in place the rules, the laws and the plans that are going to ensure that we have a safe climate for our children's future. The current government response is simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our climate is on the brink of collapse as we continue to mine and burn coal, oil and gas. Our ecosystem is crumbling. You can see that with the results of the environmental devastation that has happened just here in Australia over the last couple of months. Our precious native flora and fauna are rapidly becoming extinct. Our waterways, rivers and streams are becoming contaminated and dry. Yet we are somehow supposed to trust that this government has everything in hand, that it has the climate crisis under control. Well, it simply does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're somehow supposed to trust that this government will lead us on the world stage to meet our 2030 emissions reduction targets at a canter. Yet, of course, we know that this is done with cooking the books and trickery. The rest of the world have watched Australia burn this summer, knowing that we are at the forefront of the biggest threat that humanity has ever faced. They have seen the result of climate change with the climate fires that continued over summer. They, too, want the world to act, and they want Australia to participate in that. No-one trusts that this government is going to do it without a dramatic change of direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that is beholden to the coal industry and the fossil fuel lobby. We have an opposition party that is paralysed by inaction. Yes, we have an opposition party that has in the last few days announced a 2050 target, but it has no plan as to how to get there. We need action now, not into the distant future. Not only are we seeing Australia's total emissions steadily climb; so too are we seeing increasing amounts of political donations to the corrupted majors from the fossil fuel lobby. In 2018-19 alone, fossil fuel donations to the Liberal, Labor and National parties amounted to more than $1.8 million. If you want to know what's holding back climate action in this country, that is the reason. This was up 48 per cent from $1.3 million the year before, and, given Australia's track record of deliberately opaque, woefully inadequate political donation disclosure, the true figure is estimated to be at least five to 10 times higher. Here's a headline we should all be seeing: 'Australia's major political parties—proudly brought to you by the fossil fuel industry'. That's currently what is holding back our climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to get real about the plans in place to reduce carbon pollution, to confront climate change and to ensure that we create a safe climate for our children's future. No other party but the Greens will call out the government in this manner and hold them to account. No other party but the Greens will keep fighting for real action on climate change. But we need to work cooperatively in this place if we are to deal with this most pressing threat to humanity—this most pressing threat to the health and survival of our planet. There are some simple things that need to be done to ensure we can take those steps needed to address the crisis that the scientists and the experts are warning of. Years ago, Ross Garnaut, when he wrote his report to this place about the threats of climate change, warned that bushfires, droughts and extreme weather would have a huge economic impact on our country, and that, today, is exactly what we are seeing. That is what we need to confront, and we need some steps to get there. This climate trigger bill is one way to ensure that we can stop making climate change worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our environmental laws have simply not kept up with environmental reality. Right now we are in an extinction crisis. We have 517 animals, 87 distinct ecological communities and over 1,300 unique plant species listed as nationally threatened. That's Australia's environment—threatened, at risk of extinction. These numbers are all trending in the wrong direction, and this summer's climate fires have made that situation even worse. Globally, the UN tells us, there are a million species under threat of extinction and, to add pressure to the scale and impact the fires have had on these vulnerable species, we are running out of time more than ever. It is simply not good enough to think that this climate emergency and extinction crisis is something that is out of sight, out of mind. It is not. It is happening right here right now, and we have to make sure, as political representatives and as the community's voices in the parliament, that we stand up and do something. This is happening not in the distant future and not in some far off land; it is happening right here in our backyard. That is why we've introduced this climate trigger bill. The central point of this piece of legislation is to ensure that major projects—mining, oil and gas drilling, large-scale land-clearing projects—are assessed for their impact on climate change. How much worse will they make the climate crisis? How much pollution will these projects emit? How much pollution are these projects going to put into the atmosphere, making it harder for us to deal with the climate emergency we all know we are facing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think many members of the community would be shocked to know that, despite having environmental laws at the federal level—national laws that are meant to protect our environment—by which projects are meant to be assessed, we have no assessment as to what impact a project, an operation or a new mine will have in relation to climate change. When you put forward an application to set up or open a new mine, whether that be in Queensland, South Australia or anywhere else, you should have to make sure you know how much worse your project is going to make climate change. At the moment, that assessment is simply not done. The Adani coal mine can get a tick of environmental approval without having any assessment in relation to the impact that a massive, big coal mine will have on the climate. Of course, that's crazy. We all know that digging up more fossil fuel—digging up more coal, shipping it off overseas and burning it, or sinking an oil well in the Great Australian Bight—is going to have a huge impact on climate change. When we're all working so hard and there is a desire to reduce pollution and to get global temperature rise capped at 1½ degrees, the last thing we need is more pollution being put into the atmosphere. The last thing we need is to make it harder and tougher for us to reduce our pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This climate trigger bill is a simple, reasonable, logical step. If we are to reach net zero emissions, then we have to stop making the situation worse. We have to stop taking two steps forward and one step back. Yes, we need to transition out of the fossil fuel industry into clean, green renewable energy. Yes, we've got to become more energy efficient and use the technology advancement to our best to ensure that we can transition the whole economy. It becomes harder and harder to do that the more new mines, new oil drilling projects and new massive land-clearing operations occur. They're going to make it more difficult to reduce our carbon pollution into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our environment laws should simply assess projects on how much impact they have on the environment, and that has to include the impact on our climate. We know that climate change is the biggest threat to health and safety and to the protection of Australia and the world's environment. It is an impact and a threat to our economy, and it's an impact and a threat to our health. We saw children over the summer wearing face masks to try and keep healthy from that terrible hazy smoke just here in Canberra. We saw children in Sydney going to the playground wearing face masks. That is the type of future we are looking at if we don't arrest dangerous global warming fast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a lot of debate already in this place and outside this place over the last few days as to what targets we should have. Well, we need to start now by reducing carbon pollution, and not just in 2050. We have to start doing the hard work now, and one of the simple things we could do is to stop making the situation worse. We've got a lot of cleaning up to do. We shouldn't be creating more mess as we try and deal with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that climate change is having a huge impact on some of the most precious parts of Australia's environment. I think about what happened to my home state of South Australia over the summer. I think about the fact that a third of the vineyards in the Adelaide Hills have been wiped out because of these climate fires. The economic impact of that on my state is going to continue for a long time. Here in the Canberra region, only last week, wineries declared that there would be no vintage this season because of the smoke tainted grapes in the Canberra wine area. That's less jobs. That's less money. That's less services in our community. When I think about the environmental devastation of these fires, I think about the fact that 80 per cent of the Blue Mountains world heritage area was devastated by fire. I think about the tragic impact of wiping out half of Kangaroo Island on our beautiful environment there and the precious animals that call that place home. Over half of the koalas on Kangaroo Island perished in the fires. Our tourism industry is on its knees. Our environment is in collapse, and this bill would at least be one step forward in the plan to address climate change. So I appeal to the opposition and the government: if you're serious about getting the targets right, let's stop making things worse and put in place proper assessment for these projects into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="269375" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANTIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  I rise this morning to speak against the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020. This is a bill which purports to introduce a 'climate trigger'—as it has been described—through a thorough environmental assessment of emissions-intensive activities. But in reality this is nothing more than greenwash and green tape from a political party who consistently place this country and its economic fortunes last on the podium of priorities and who are instead intent upon wrecking this country and its economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to define, in the broadest terms, actions which involve mining operations, drilling operations or land clearing as emissions-intensive actions, regardless of the actual emissions associated with such operations. Those of us who understand basic economics understand that all of those operations lie at the very heart of the operational and economic success of this country and are integral to our prosperity and success. This bill seeks to destroy industries which are reliant on these types of operations, and it does so by adding more green tape and creating convoluted regulations which will do nothing but wreck, disrupt and destroy those wealth-generating activities which allow this country to prosper. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that activities such as mining, drilling exploration and land clearing are already subject to stringent regulation under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and are also subject to stringent state and territory legislation on top of that. Insofar as they impact matters of national environmental significance, mining, drilling, land clearing and other activities are subject to rigorous assessment and scrutiny by both Commonwealth and state authorities. This regulatory framework is designed to promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of our natural resources. Australia's response to emissions reduction is already being properly and responsibly addressed through a broad framework of government policy and legislation. This bill seeks to introduce yet more regulation and yet more green tape for its own sake and in truth is nothing more than a green Trojan Horse seeking to blunt economic development in this country. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is premised on the misinformation that Australia's emissions are somehow responsible for the tragic bushfire season we have just experienced. But of course the Australian people are too clever to fall for such irresponsible hysteria. Just this morning Newspoll reported that only 35 per cent of people surveyed believe climate change was the main cause of the severity of the bushfires. So, if passed, this bill would give the means and the opportunity to challenge, delay, hinder and in some cases completely prevent developments on the grounds of being emissions intensive, when there is no proper basis to claim such. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is a proud legacy of the Howard government, and the Morrison government is committed to ensuring this legislation continues to strike the right balance, enabling development to proceed in a way which protects our unique natural habitat. In fact, there is a 10-year independent statutory review of the act underway, and this bill attempts to circumvent that process. Professor Graeme Samuel, who is leading the review, has conducted a broad range of consultations to inform his report. So, if ever there was a time to be amending this act, now is not that time. This bill is ill-conceived and will merely duplicate much existing regulation, bog down industry and damage our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the Australian Greens' craven attempt to wind back economic prosperity, the Morrison government understands that sensible, reasonable and responsible attempts to reduce emissions can be made without the need to trash our economy. The Morrison government is taking meaningful action to deliver lower emissions while growing our economy and keeping our electricity prices down. While the Labor Party struggle internally with the same uncosted, unchecked emissions policies they took to the election, and were defeated on, the Morrison government has outlined a real plan to meet and beat our targets. We are on track to overachieve on our 2020 target by in the order of 411 million tonnes. We have a package of measures to meet and beat the 2030 target. We've laid out that we'll deliver the target 11 years ahead of time, through supporting farmers, businesses and communities to reduce greenhouse gasses; by bringing new electricity generation projects online, such as Snowy 2.0 and the Battery of the Nation; and by supporting households and businesses to improve their energy efficiency and to lower their household energy bills. We're now seeing record levels of renewable investment, including almost $9 billion in investments from the Commonwealth. Therefore, the utility of this bill in the chamber today is as questionable as it is unnecessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, if the Greens actually wanted to lower or reduce emissions in this country then they would be advocating for the elephant in the room—a nuclear energy industry. Australia has had in the past an opportunity to pursue nuclear energy—a form of energy which is clean, efficient, abundant and virtually emissions free. Fortunately, this country still has the opportunity to establish a nuclear industry, as this country's geology, climate, plentiful resources and stable democracy make it possible. Yet the Greens have refused to even consider such an industry. Canada—as a case study—chose to pursue a nuclear industry in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result, they have seen a safe multibillion-dollar industry thrive. As the world's second-largest producer of uranium, Canada now exports 85 per cent of its product, as part of an industry worth $1.3 billion per annum. Nuclear energy provided 15 per cent of Canada's electricity in 2018 with next to zero emissions. In the order of 60,000 Canadian jobs are now supported by its nuclear industry, many of them high-paying and high-tech. If countries like Canada, France and the United States can meet substantial amounts of their electricity needs from nuclear reactors, there really is no reason that Australia should not or could not generate most, if not all, of its electricity from new, efficient and, most importantly, safe nuclear power generation. But, sadly, the Australian Greens are seemingly incapable of articulating why it is that they remain resistant to such a solution, save to observe that in the world of green Left politics no solution is palatable unless it is 100 per cent ideologically pure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who tell us that we're experiencing a climate emergency can, sadly, no longer have their ideological cake and eat it too. We need less politically motivated grandstanding and more pragmatism in order to reduce our emissions further. So, for the Australian Greens, who talk the emissions reduction talk, it's now time to walk the nuclear-power walk. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  This has been an awful summer. It's been an awful summer particularly in my home state of New South Wales, which has suffered awfully under an unprecedented bushfire crisis and then in parts of the state with extreme weather events, particularly in relation to rainfall that has then gone on to produce flooding. It's a state that's been suffering and continues to suffer from drought, and all of these things are directly related to climate change. All of these things are consistent with the predictions made for many decades by climate scientists about the consequences of a warming planet. All of these things should propel people in this place—in this chamber and in the other place—to action on climate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great shame—the great waste—of the last seven years of coalition government is their complete and total inability to get a grip on this problem. The internal dynamics within the coalition party room are simply so bad, so divisive and so difficult, that no leader—not Mr Abbott, not Mr Turnbull and not Mr Morrison—has been able to present a coherent energy policy, or a coherent climate policy, to their own party room and have it accepted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we are keenly aware of the urgent need for action and we have offered support to the many variants of climate policy and energy policy that have been put forward by the government. We're interested in the clean energy target. We were interested when they were talking about an emissions intensity scheme. We were interested, certainly, when they were talking about the National Energy Guarantee, and I guess we'll be interested in whatever it is that they bowl up next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that it is absolutely critical that we move to an evidence based policy that accepts what the economists tell us about the cost of future energy, accepts what the science tells us about the cost of inaction on climate change and accepts what the market tells us about the enormous instability and uncertainty that this continuing failure to have an energy policy is placing on it. The truth is the market is on strike and, if there is a problem in our electricity system, it arises directly from the failure of the government benches over seven years to develop an energy policy that anyone can understand. The problems arise directly from the National Party, who simply don't accept the science of climate change—and you heard the ignorant responses presented by National Party members and senators last night when they were asked about this same question. But the problems also arise inside the Liberal Party from a group of people who prefer the culture wars on climate to actual solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear that the bill before the chamber today, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020, seems unlikely to do very much about any of these problems. My concern is that this is part of what has been a very effective branding strategy on the part of the Greens political party to let everyone know they're opposed to climate change, but I don't think it's part of a coherent strategy to lay out a policy agenda that Australians can get behind. I don't think it's part of a political strategy that will built a broad constituency across the community in support of climate action. On the bill in particular, let's be honest about it. We all understand how this works. This bill will not succeed. If it manages to pass the Senate, it will go on to languish on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> in the House of Representatives, and the government controls the legislative agenda in the House of Representatives. They're not prepared to consider their own climate change legislation, let alone legislation prepared by another party. Even if the legislation did by some miracle get up, it wouldn't make that much difference at all to the task, because the task is transforming the Australian economy to net zero by 2050 and starting now to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about what this bill will and won't do. Nothing in this bill relates to the potential emissions of the product of a mine—just the emissions from the construction itself. This legislation treats a mine producing dirty brown thermal coal exactly the same way as it treats a mine producing zinc for solar panels. The only factor that matters is the emission from constructing it. In any event, the act that it seeks to amend, the EPBC Act, contains substantial discretions for the minister. The nature of judicial review means that the merits of this discretion will never be tested by a court, and this bill would not stop the Minister for the Environment approving 15 new Adani-size mines side by side in the middle of a rainforest if she set her mind to it. That's not to say there aren't interesting proposals in the bill. We look forward to having an opportunity to consider through the committee process whether it's fit for purpose. But this is not part of a realistic strategy for combating climate change. More importantly, it is not part of a strategy for building a coalition to combat climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens political party have their origin in an environmental movement that was practical and grounded. It's an ethos that has been enormously influential in Australian politics. Indeed, part of my political awakening, and part of the reason I was interested in politics as a kid, was that overdevelopment threatened the beautiful place in which I grew up in northern New South Wales. People in my community didn't like it and they responded politically. People from all walks of life got together. They were united by the realisation that the environment that surrounded us was more valuable to us than what had been promised by developers. And it didn't just happen. Small-business owners, farmers, teachers, tradies—they were all in it. You might have thought that there was more to drive those people apart than to bring them together, but local campaigners, people who showed real leadership and whom I truly admire, created a movement that was open enough for very different people to find a place in it. It was open enough and big enough that all sorts of people could come together, feel welcome and fight for common values together. Those environmentalists, those people in my community, created change by building a coalition of interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is that the approach from the Greens political party has left this tradition behind. The Greens political party did have their origin in that kind of movement. They had their origin in sit-ins and local protests. But the new party, the new Greens, have their roots in the moral absolutism of culture wars. The problem is that that's not taking us anywhere, because they've been going on for a long time. To create deep, lasting change we need deep and broad support, and the task is to build that support in the community. The Greens are not prepared to do that work, or at least they haven't been to date. They are usually committed to demonstrating their bona fides to a constituency that is already committed to effective action on climate change. That's a really important group of people—we need people who are passionate and committed to action—but what is missing is any sense from the Greens that they are committed to engaging with anyone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, former senator Bob Brown was quoted as describing the people in regional Queensland who opposed his pre-election climate convoy as an unruly mob—that's a quote—that was 'cranky, nasty, inhospitable'. Former senator Bob Brown said he was tired of being polite to planet killers. That's also a quote. Now, it might come as news to many involved in the climate change debate that the Greens were being 'polite' beforehand—that this is a new position—but the bigger problem is the attitude that was displayed. The alternative is to consider the possibility that, maybe, working people with legitimate concerns about their livelihood, the livelihood of their families and the future of their children may not be the real enemy here. That would be an alternative approach—to consider that one of the challenges for us is to create a movement in which people from all walks of life can see a place for themselves; to recognise that people have a right to be worried about their jobs and the future of their families, communities and way of life, and that it's our role to answer those fears. That is the approach that Labor brings to climate change policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that on Friday the Leader of the Opposition announced that an Albanese Labor government will promise to make Australia carbon neutral by 2050. Labor is the only party capable of forming a government that is committed to real action on climate change. We know this, and anyone watching the shambles on the other side knows this. It is only a Labor government that will build an economy where, by 2050, the amount of pollution we release into the atmosphere will be no greater than the amount we absorb. This is the right thing to do. Strong climate action is needed not only to protect the prosperity of future generations of Australians but also to meet our international obligations. It's also an enormous opportunity. We have the opportunity to deliver prosperity by modernising our economy and adapting to inevitable climate impacts. All states and territories have already promised to be carbon neutral by 2050. Australian businesses are calling for this, including AGL, Amcor Wesfarmers, Telstra, Qantas and others. Seventy-three countries around the world, including the UK, Canada, France and Germany—many with conservative governments—have already adopted this as their goal. So it's time to move on. Real action, science based goals, bringing the country together—that is what we need. We do not need the same old Liberal and Greens playbook of dividing the nation for political gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goal is a goal that the CSIRO says will deliver higher wages and incomes and lower power costs. It is a goal that the University of Melbourne says will deliver 20 times greater benefit to the economy than any costs. The Business Council of Australia says getting to net zero emissions by 2050 will mean $22 billion of new investment per year; that is $22 billion of new jobs, new infrastructure and new industries. That is an investment boom. It's an investment boom which, like all past investment booms, will grow incomes, will grow jobs and will grow Australia. More than that, it will put Australia in a strong position to argue for greater action internationally, because, in the end, only international action will deliver a safe climate. Crucially, our policies will be underpinned by commitments to ensure no workers or communities are left behind as well as to protect future generations from dangerous climate change that would see even worse emergencies than the ones we have seen over this last summer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Action on climate is as important for regional Queensland as it is for Sydney and Melbourne. This is a shared challenge. We are in this together. We need a movement for change that has different voices—from the bush, from our cities, from our suburbs and from our towns. Labor is committed to building this coalition and committed to taking action.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Senator McAllister says that this bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020, is not a workable strategy being put up by the Greens, who are into the moral absolutism of climate wars. This is something which makes great sense to me. We have a situation where we on this side of the parliament are criticised for the simple fact that it is perceived that we are broken. We are not broken. Every time I hear dysfunctional talk of a dysfunctional group, I think of the Otis group on coal and of the coal documents of 2016 which are in the media at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, as the Greens and the member for Warringah are aware but continually deny, we in the coalition are acting on climate change now. We don't just talk; we don't sit back and debate irrational triggers. We are well past that. I personally am strongly committed not only to acting on climate change but also to adapting to a hotter, drier climate. Both are important. Unlike the Greens and the member for Warringah, we put the focus on mitigating risk and adapting rather than on taking a closed-mind, ideological view and mouthing naive, uncosted, feel-good statements, backed up in certain circumstances by bullying and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Net zero emissions, mentioned by Senator McAllister, need to be justified and costed, not just mouthed. There is no economic case to do so, and the reduction in emissions, if it occurs, could have no impact on the world climate. Let's not forget that China has somewhere between 1,032 and 2,400 coal-fired power stations and is building 126 more. Japan has 90 coal-fired power stations and is building somewhere between 22 and 45 more, depending on the source.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election the government took a clear plan to the Australian people to responsibly reduce Australia's carbon dioxide emissions, consistent with our international commitments. We as a government remain committed to this plan. I personally remain committed to this policy as a prudent policy and I know that reducing emissions will be accompanied by rock-solid policies to adapt to a hotter and a drier continent. This government led Australia to beat its first Kyoto target by 128 million tonnes. We're projected to beat our 2020 target by 411 million tonnes. Our 2030 Paris target reduces emissions by 26 to 28 per cent, on 2005 levels, by 2030. Over this period we will halve the amount of emissions per Australian. On a per capita basis, our emissions reductions will be greater than those of many comparable countries, including the European Union, Canada, Japan and Korea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an ambitious but responsible emissions reduction target for 2030. We will meet it and we intend to beat it. The latest emission projections already show we are on track to do so. We do not need triggers. But, as you quite well know but are ignoring because it doesn't match certain ideologies, Australia cannot cut global emissions in isolation. The development and deployment of new technologies will be essential to reducing emissions, both here and around the world, while creating jobs. Our focus is on improving existing technologies and adopting new technologies, not taxes. We do not support the introduction of a carbon tax. We do not support driving up electricity prices and we do not support plans that will abandon the jobs of many regional Australians and make emissions reductions unsustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, working closely with industry, researchers and international partners, we are developing a technology investment road map, to focus our investment on driving down the cost of low-emissions technology, as recently forecast by Minister Taylor. It will also guide us as we seek to deploy new technology as rapidly as possible, to reduce emissions both at home and overseas. That road map will position Australia to contribute to and take advantage of global technologies. It will set a framework for our investment in emissions-reducing technologies over the short period, to 2022; the medium period, to 2030; and the long term, to 2050. This builds on what we're already doing to drive down emissions, including the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which brings down the cost of renewable energy; the $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund, to promote investment in battery and pumped hydro renewable energy storage; our $500 million hydrogen strategy, to position us as a key player in the emerging green hydrogen economy; and our soon-to-be-released electric vehicles strategy, to accelerate the modernisation of our transport fleet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me summarise by saying that Australia's emissions are coming down. In fact, Australia's emissions are lower now than when the coalition came to government in 2013. Australia's emissions are more than 12 per cent lower than in 2005. This compares to a two per cent reduction for Canada and a four per cent increase for New Zealand over the same period. Let's mitigate risk. Where risks cannot be mitigated, we must adapt. Those impacted by the recent bushfires want practical measures and not the mouthing of ideologies.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Australia is at a point in its history where it needs to take decisive action on climate change and reduce its emissions. Disappointingly, the federal government is so far reluctant to do any heavy lifting in this area, so it's up to the rest of us to make some noise on this issue. The bill we are debating today, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020, was introduced only in the last sitting week and hasn't been sent for inquiry, so we have not had a chance to consider it in any great depth. However, there is certainly the kernel of a good idea here. At a high level, parts of what it proposes have merit and should very much be considered. It makes sense to require emissions to be factored into the environmental assessments of major activities such as mining, drilling, exploration or land clearing. We do need to consider the climate impact of major projects if we are to move Australia to a carbon-neutral future. As the saying goes, you can't manage what you don't measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this bill does take a heavy-handed approach. It is also a bit short on detail. It seeks to prohibit emissions-intensive actions as if they have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on the environment, but the bill does not define what that threshold would be for emissions. More importantly, I'm concerned that simply banning these activities because they are high emitting is short-sighted, as it risks throwing out the good with the bad. There are other remedies. One approach might be instead to ensure there are plans in place to mitigate emissions before environmental approval is granted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, this bill would benefit from an inquiry, but my concern with imposing a blanket ban is that it will impact in unintended ways. For instance, you can't build mobile phones, rechargeable batteries or solar panels without mining for rare earth minerals such as cobalt and palladium. And what about geothermal energy? That is a potential source of renewable energy which is still in its infancy in Australia and requires exploratory drilling. But, at first glance, this bill may rule that out. And what about mining for everyday metals such as copper, aluminium, silver, iron, zinc or nickel? This is the stuff on which we have built our physical environment and which is contained in everything from household water pipes to electric guitar strings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely need to bring down emissions, but we also need to be realistic and practical. We don't need to take an all-or-nothing approach, as this bill does. The more sensible approach for a major project which otherwise stacks up economically and environmentally is to look at what will be done to mitigate the emissions. We need to act on climate change, and what we need is a national plan that commits to a carbon-neutral future and provides a framework for ongoing mitigation and investment certainty. We need to work towards net zero emissions. We need to plan for how we transition Australia to a renewable and clean energy future. We need more than a piecemeal approach. The business community is largely on board, so you have to wonder why this government isn't.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I commend the Greens for bringing forward some debate on these important issues, but, as the nation well understands, we need governments to be able to make decisions that change the nature of our economy, in terms of our energy-intensive nature. Labor certainly believes that strong action on climate change is needed to protect not only our environment but the prosperity of future generations and our international obligations. We know that we need to modernise our economy and adapt to inevitable climate impacts. Labor has always been deeply committed to these principles, and it was a privilege to be in this place as a member of the last Labor government, seriously working through these issues. We know, when we see the impact around our nation from this summer, what a devastating impact climate change can have on our nation. As a party, our core principles and our approach to climate change policy remain certain and unshakeable. It is, indeed, why we have committed Australia to being a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, and this is consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris accord.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we can do this as a nation and we know that the sooner we start doing this the better. The Greens might say, 'Well, why not vote for this legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020?' Actually, 'the sooner we start doing this' is not just about rapidly dreaming up a clause that comes down on the economy like a tonne of bricks, with the job impacts that go with it. We need to make step-by-step changes to transition our economy and to transition jobs—something that is sorely lacking from this government. What the Australian people should be listening for from this government is their plan for jobs in a carbon constrained future. Is this government going to continue pretending that a carbon constrained future is not on the cards? Where are the practical steps that you as a government will take to put us on this path? It's all very well to have a Prime Minister who now seems to be prepared to start talking about the need to adapt to climate change when, it seems to me, the words have only very recently started to come out of his mouth at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a nation that is committed to high wages, high incomes and lower power costs. We in the Labor Party truly believe that this is possible, because we can already see greater benefits to the national economy from being on this transition plan. That is what modelling shows us relative to continuing with business as usual, which will inevitably have some massively dislocating impact on the economy in the future. What's very clear is that the environmental impact is already having a massively dislocating impact on our society and on our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a nation must not only do the right thing by future generations but also do the right thing by our economic interests today and tomorrow. We have a government that seems prepared to act to the detriment of the safety and prosperity of all Australians. This government refuses to adapt, even though every state and territory government—Labor and Liberal alike—have recognised these issues themselves. Australia has the potential to become an energy superpower, but only if we have the leadership to bring Australia together to seize the opportunities in front of us as a nation.</span>

I do so with the voices of thousands of my Victorian constituents ringing in my ears, calling for strong action on the climate crisis. This past weekend I joined thousands of people who gave up their usual weekend activities to rally together in solidarity as part of the national day of climate action. We put climate action first this weekend because we know what's at stake. People gathered in cities and towns across the country calling for a safe climate. It's our job as elected representatives to listen to those constituents and to act. The weekend before that I joined 2,000 people who were at the National Climate Emergency Summit at the Melbourne town hall. And this morning, on my bike ride to parliament, I met a couple and their young baby who were there, standing up for action, saying that young people, our kids, need a safe climate future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We Greens are acting. We are listening to these constituents and we are acting. This bill is just one of the actions that this parliament needs to take to make sure that we take action, the speed and scale that is needed to tackle a requirement emergency. The Greens are the firefighters in our parliament. We are the ones who are ringing the alarm bells about the emergency and then finding a safe path through the emergency to the emergency exit. This safe path needs action now, not in 20 years time. The next decade is critical. Zero by 2050: it may be great or it may be too late. We need action in the next decade to find that safe path through. Part of that safe path is this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill focuses on our key national environment protection legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and seeks to bring it into the 21st century by closing the major loophole that exists in that act. The EPBC Act absolutely must take carbon pollution into account. We know that climate change is producing hotter conditions, more droughts, more floods, more extreme and intense bushfires, as we have all experienced this summer, and longer fire seasons. It is producing coral bleaching—the Great Barrier Reef is about to have another extensive bleaching event—sea level rise and warming oceans. It is a massive threat to our precious natural environments and our wildlife. So it makes no sense that activities that are actually causing climate change currently aren't assessed by our national environment laws. We must close this loophole. No, it's more than a loophole; it is a chasm. It's a chasm that's big enough to drive a fleet of coal loaders and bulldozers through. The Adani coalmine wasn't assessed for what impact it would have on global heating. The Beetaloo Basin, which Labor and Liberal alike want to open up, is a massive carbon bomb. Under our current environment legislation that will not be assessed for how much it is going to increase global heating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Assessing the emissions of fossil fuel projects and tree-destroying developments is one of the easiest steps that this parliament can take to tackle pollution and its devastating impacts on us, our kids and our grandkids, who are staring down the barrel of a future filled with more fires, more floods, more heatwaves, droughts and crop failures. We have a choice, and I call upon the Senate to support this bill with a safe climate future firmly in mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill defines 'land clearing' as one of several emission-intensive actions. That is really appropriate, because we know that land clearing has got critical consequences when it comes to greenhouse gas pollution. I would like to read a summary from the Climate Council's 2018 report. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015 the land use sector in Queensland generated 19 million tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution, which was more pollution than the agriculture sector or around 20% of the pollution from the entire energy sector including electricity, stationary energy and transport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that isn't shocking enough, let's put it in an international perspective. That land clearing in Queensland in 2015-16 amounted to the equivalent of almost half of the vegetation cleared in the entire Brazilian Amazon rainforest. This report outlines key ways that land clearing contributes to increased carbon emissions in terms of our climate emergency. It outlines how clearing vegetation releases the significant carbon it contains, and that vegetation that's cleared can no longer store the carbon that's so necessary, which makes it harder for us to stay within our carbon budget. That's why this bill builds land clearing and other triggers relating to emissions generation into the legislation: so we can stop making the climate emergency worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got a whole lot of clearing up to do to tackle our climate emergency, and the first thing we can do is stop making the problem worse. Clearing of vegetation across huge areas of the Australian landscape has escalated in recent years. It's contributing to a massive increase in carbon pollution and a massive loss of habitat for threatened and critically endangered species as well. Adding a climate trigger to the EPBC Act means we can assess the double whammy of this clearing: both its impacts on habitat reduction and the emissions implications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider the Great Barrier Reef. The reef just does not stand a chance with the enormous amounts of clearing into the catchments feeding into it. Climate change is wrecking the reef. As I said, we're about to face another massive coral bleaching. It might be the end of the Great Barrier Reef. We know that land clearing and run-off are wrecking the reef, and they are both reinforcing each other. Australians are mourning the loss of our magnificent Great Barrier Reef, and this government is doing nothing. This bill does something. This bill says that land clearing and its effects on the climate crisis cannot be swept under the carpet any longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note here too that rampant deforestation occurs in areas of land across Australia that are not subject to consideration under the EPBC Act due to the outdated regional forest agreements. Yes, it's the 21st century, but we've got significant areas of native forest with clear felling of complex ecosystems and destruction of significant carbon sinks for low-value outputs like copy paper and pallets for cartons of beer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are working to improve our federal environment laws here today, but we're also working to scrap those regional forest agreements, which were made last century and which don't meet the standards and needs of our current challenges, both environmentally and economically. Every other extractive industry has to meet the basic provisions of the EPBC Act, so why not logging? We're working here to strengthen the EPBC Act with this climate trigger bill, and we also have legislation to scrap our destructive logging laws. There is a very clear choice. Only the Greens have a plan to tackle our climate crisis and to protect nature. We're the only party that does not take donations from those coal, gas and oil industries, or donations from any large corporations. We are the only party that will hold the major parties to account. We must act if we want to prevent the climate emergency from destroying so much that is beautiful in our natural world. There is no time to waste if we're going to prevent further global heating, and assessing the pollution from fossil fuel projects and tree-destroying developments is one of the easiest steps that this parliament could take to ensure that humanity has a future. I call upon my fellow senators to support this bill. I now seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I rise to speak to the Greens' Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018. This is a bill that would keep coal in the ground. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC—the international coalition of the vast majority of the world's scientists—have clearly said that we cannot afford new thermal coal in the system. We are already on a trajectory to three or possibly four degrees of global warming, and we've seen the havoc that our communities and our planet have experienced at just one degree of warming. We've seen the summer with millions of hectares of our nation burnt, with lives lost, with homes lost, with productivity lost and with people's lives ripped apart. That was just at one degree of warming, and this government's complete absence of climate policy has us on track for between three and four degrees of warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is why the IPCC—the world's climate scientists—are saying: 'No new coal.' But what do we have? We have approval for the Adani Carmichael coalmine issued many years ago—with bipartisan support, I might add—where the climate impacts of that mine were not even assessed by our so-called environmental laws. The bill that we've just been debating would fix that, and it would say that you can't approve a coalmine without looking at the impacts that it will have on our climate. But we heard some pretty bizarre contributions that somehow seemed to fail to grasp that fairly logical point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have bipartisan support for the Adani Carmichael coalmine to proceed, and the defence that the opposition gives is that it got its approvals. Well, it got its approvals under laws that don't require its climate impacts to be assessed. It got its approvals by extinguishing native title, which the state Labor government have done to the Wangan and Yagalingu people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no saving grace for this carbon bomb. This bill would cancel Adani's approval, and it would say to folk like Clive Palmer: 'You can't buy your way into a new coalmine in the Galilee Basin. The Galilee Basin coal has to stay in the ground, where it belongs and where the science says that it needs to stay if we are to have any hope of constraining global warming so that there will be a liveable future for us all.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very simple bill. In fact, I introduced it back in 2018. So I was a bit perplexed that we heard from the opposition that they haven't had enough time to consider the bill, because it has been on the books since 2018. Methinks there's a bit of nervousness in taking a position on coal. We see this continued lack of spine. Sadly, we saw a somewhat positive announcement about a 2050 zero emissions target but no plan to get there in the interim. We saw the opposition leader espouse the need to still be exporting thermal coal by 2050. Are you serious? The science is saying that we can't handle any more thermal coal in the system now, let alone in 30 years time. This bill would keep that coal in the ground where it belongs. It would respect the rights of traditional owners in that basin area, including the Wangan and Yagalingu people. It would protect that groundwater from being polluted and overused whilst other farming operations are starved of water in that region which has been in drought for so very long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big parties don't want to vote on this bill. It's all very inconvenient for them to take a position on coal. One wonders whether the massive donations from big coal—and big oil and big gas for that matter—have something to do with their reticence to embrace the global transition to clean energy that is already underway. It's almost $10 million that big coal, oil and gas have donated to both sides of politics since 2012. I think it's $5.8 million, if my memory serves me correctly, to the Liberal and National parties, and $3½ million to the Labor Party. We don't think that the money should be allowed to be donated to political parties. We don't think that big coal should be able to buy off political parties' silence and their continued support for a fossil fuel that the rest of the world is already transitioning off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Global thermal coal demand is down—it continues to be down—and renewable uptake is skyrocketing. Australia is best placed to service that global demand. We could be a renewable energy superpower, and we're now not the only ones saying that. But if we don't tackle our export of coal, we will never be able to act on the climate emergency we are in. We need to recognise that the global transition away from thermal coal is already happening, and we need to stand with those coal communities and transition them into what comes next. It's not rocket science, folks. We can have clean energy jobs that protect those communities. We can have mining jobs that mine for the minerals that are needed for renewable energy components. We can have mine rehabilitation that, sadly, is badly needed for the 50,000 abandoned mines that pockmark this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many jobs that those communities could be transitioned into, many of which won't require any retraining at all. Those skills will be directly transferrable. Those communities know that thermal coal's days are numbered, but they're not hearing any plans from either the government or the opposition on how to cope with this transition that's already happening. They're desperate for that conversation about what comes next for them, where their future prosperity is going to come from, whether their town will stay alive. We want those towns to stay alive. We want that conversation to happen with those communities, and those communities deserve those jobs. But they deserve real jobs, not lies from multinational companies that, on one hand, say there are going to be a stack of jobs but then, in court, admit that it's going to be a tenth of that and then, out of the other side of their mouth, say, 'Oh, but we want to automate from pit to port.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These communities know when they're being lied to, and they can see the global transition that's already underway. It's just staggering, when conservative governments around the world—even Boris Johnson in the UK, for heaven's sake—are accepting the climate emergency and taking some small steps to tackle it, that there is still bipartisan support for new coal mines in this country. Well, I'm really proud that the Greens continue to be the voice to advocate against new thermal coal mines, to advocate for that transition to 100 per cent clean energy as quickly as we possibly can. We know we've got the technology to do it. We know it creates new jobs, that it doesn't make workers sick, that it doesn't kill workers on mine sites or give them black lung disease. We know we've got that technological capacity, but what's perfectly clear is that we lack the political will. And, again, people are asking questions about whether the big donations are buying the complicity of both of the major political parties. People can draw their own conclusions about that, but it seems pretty clear-cut to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, 50 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef is bleached—50 per cent of that coral cover has died permanently—after two successive bleaching events, in 2016 and 2017. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA—that reputable and recognised international body—says there might be yet another mass bleaching that will cripple the reef this summer. That's 64,000 jobs that rely on the reef to remain healthy, to remain alive, to not be half-dead. Yet we see a defence from the government that somehow the 1,464 possible jobs with Adani outweigh the 64,000 actual—in real life, already existing—jobs that rely on the reef remaining healthy. Even in their own morally bankrupt jobs-and-economy-only frame of reference, the figures don't add up. And when you factor in the cost of the climate-fuelled natural disasters that we've just seen wreak havoc on this nation, it doesn't add up on that metric either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, look at the cost to nature—a billion animals burnt, extinction at all-time highs and our very planet on the brink of collapse. It doesn't seem to matter much to this government. They've never really paid much attention to the climate science, and they're probably not going to start now. But we beg them to do just a little bit of reading. Rather than sacking those CSIRO scientists, why don't they listen to them and get some advice about the economic cost, if nothing else? They don't care so much about the cost to nature, but they could at least look at the economics of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could be a renewable energy exporting superpower. We could have that prosperity. We could create those jobs. We could tackle the climate crisis all at once. That's part of what we call a 'green new deal'. This is exactly what many other countries are now talking about. It is gathering global momentum. We can have that prosperity in a way that looks after nature and supports workers. But what we need to do is keep that Galilee coal in the ground. It's not just Adani. Clive Palmer has his claws in there and I think Gina Rinehart has a few proposals, and there are a few other big multinational coal companies that want to open it up—there are about nine coalmine proposals. If we were to allow the basin to be opened up, it would be the seventh largest emitter in the world, if it were considered to be a country. That's how big this coal basin is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reason that a new coal basin has not been opened up for 50 years, and there is now a scientific imperative why we don't open one. But both this government and the opposition have waved through approvals for the Carmichael coalmine. They don't care about water impacts and certainly don't care about extinguishing native title. They don't care about the climate impacts and they don't care about the lies about job creation rather than the reality of the reef jobs that will go and agricultural jobs that will be threatened with the continuing change in the climate. They don't care about the potential for real renewable jobs for mining rehab, for mining minerals for renewable energy components. The solutions are there. But, sadly, the big parties in this nation are being blinded by the big dollars flowing from the big polluters. It's as simple as that, and it is heartbreaking, because money and power should not be wrecking the future for all of us. But that is precisely what's happening under this government's watch, with the complicity of the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we commend the Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill to the Senate. But we are not allowed to have a vote on it today, because, sadly, the opposition didn't have enough time to consider a bill that was drafted and introduced in 2018. We all know what that actually means. They just don't want to have to vote for coal and they don't want to have to vote against coal. They wish everybody would stop asking them about coal. Well, those coal communities actually deserve the truth. They deserve a decent answer and they deserve to be consulted on what happens next for them, for their families, for their region and for their community. The Greens are up for having that conversation. We had the Senate inquiry into regional jobs, which went to many of those coal communities last year. People know what's happening. They are not stupid. They actually can see that the world is turning away from our dirty coal. There is a reason that none of those private financiers are backing Galilee Basin coal. There is a reason that they can't get insurance. There is a reason that they have their hand out to get funding for the railway line. The private market does not want to touch new thermal coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, India announced that they want to stop coal imports in 2022, I think it was. They have said that before. They are holding fast to that position—2022 isn't here yet, former minister Canavan. The rest of the world is already making that transition. This government, sadly with the support of the opposition, is losing the chance for us to position ourselves as a world leader in renewable energy—to create those jobs, to help protect what's left of the reef from another bleaching episode, to protect the beautiful biodiversity on which life depends. And yes, we're not even allowed to vote on this bill today. But we Greens won't stop talking about global transitions off coal. We won't stop advocating for those coal communities to be consulted, to be protected, to be transitioned. We don't want that shock that will come overnight when those multinational coal companies just pull out of coal. We've already seen many of those large coal companies put an end date on their own coal extraction activities. The market gets it, folks. The community gets it. What will it take for the big political parties to get it? I'm incredulous that they are so in denial of the scientific and economic reality. There's a reason that the vote for the larger parties is the lowest it has ever been in history. They don't feel that you're listening to them. They want democracy back. They are sick of corporate donations getting outcomes for corporate profits. They want communities' interests to be put first and they want the planet protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first step in doing that is to back this bill, to keep that Galilee coal in the ground, to respect the rights of the Wangan and Jagalingou and other traditional owners in that area, to stand with those coal communities and give them a future—a legitimate future, not lies about jobs that will never eventuate but real jobs—and to protect those real jobs that already exist around the reef and agriculture, which are massively climate exposed. We'll never know what the position of the big parties is on this bill, because they won't vote on it today and they probably won't let us bring it on again. But the community is watching. They want action on the climate emergency, they want justice for those coal communities and they want a future to share for us all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  The Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018 demonstrates that the Greens are the John McEnroe of this parliament. They cannot cop an umpire's decision. They cannot cop the decision of the umpire when it comes to doing environmental assessments. They always like to call on the umpire's decision when it goes in their favour. When the umpire makes a decision to restrict a project or stop jobs being created under our environmental laws, the Greens will very quickly point to that and say, 'See, that demonstrates what we have been saying, and it should be adhered to.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever that same umpire—in this case, the departments of environment at state and federal levels—makes a decision that the Greens don't support or don't agree with, the Greens immediately come in and say, 'No, it's all wrong, and we've got to ban it anyway.' What is the point of having our environmental laws if you are only going to accept decisions when they go your way? We have very robust laws in this country that assess major projects in our nation, like those that are in question here, with this bill, like those in the Galilee Basin. They go through an incredibly rigorous environmental assessment process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I would like to briefly recap on the process that was gone through for Adani's Carmichael mine, which is one of the potential mines that are subject to this bill here today. We have very robust environmental laws. The saga of the Carmichael mine goes back to 2009, more than 10 years ago, when Adani first acquired a licence. It actually starts before then, I suppose. Linc Energy previously owned this area. They were looking for gas but eventually sold it to Adani when they found more coal than gas in the area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those that may not know, it does bear repeating exactly where this mine is. It's just under 400 kilometres from the coast of Queensland. It's west of Mackay, which is probably the major town, so a long way inland. The closest town is around 150 kilometres away at Clermont. It's a long way away. This is in a new coal basin but, really, it's in a new frontier for our nation. There hasn't been any major development in this part of Queensland to note. There are some cattle properties but not many people live in this area. The properties are largely run remotely or by staff that fly in, fly out. It is a long way away from other things that go on in this country. It is a very beautiful part of our country, though. It's an area that should be protected. I've been to the Carmichael site a number of times. I'm not sure if Senator Waters has been there, but I've been there a couple of times. There are some environmental assets in the region. I've been to the Doongmabulla Springs, which is one of the assets in question, and there are some threatened species as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these things have been assessed to death over the 10-year period that Adani has been looking at this mine. Take, for example, one of the threatened species: the black-throated finch. It is an important bird in our ecosystem that must be protected. Adani has spent around $1 million assessing the extent of the finch on its property, what can be done to protect it. Adani has spent more money on the finch than almost—well, we think—anyone else ever has before. In fact, one of the original conditions the Queensland government's coordinator-general imposed on the Adani project—back in, I think, 2015—was that the Queensland government should develop a black-throated finch management industry for the whole state. Guess what? Five years on, the Queensland government hasn't done that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Adani were also obliged, under those conditions, to do a management strategy for their site—and they have done that. It's all mapped out in public and in great detail. They will reserve 30,000 hectares of land close to their Carmichael mine site, which will be turned into a finch habitat. We in fact know a lot more about the finch itself and how to protect it, thanks to the research Adani funded. We didn't know a lot about how the finch bred, how it ate and where it liked to nest, but, because of the work that was done through this project and funded by a commercial entity, we now know a lot more about that. And this area of 30,000 hectares that Adani will be protecting will be better for the finch thanks to that research and knowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that the Greens will never admit—and will never actually admit here in this debate—is that it's often through these large projects and large investments that we're able to fund the environmental work that makes our country a better place. The governments aren't doing it. The Queensland state government aren't funding protection for the black-throated finch, despite their protestations over the last couple of years. The federal government doesn't have the money to do it all. We rely on people who have an incentive to protect their environment as well as to sustainably develop it to make these investments, and that is what has been done here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, the Doongmabulla Springs, which was the scope of a lot of controversy, is an important permanent water source, especially for the cattle industry in the area. It is, I think, a state government listed environmental asset. It is not listed on any national registers, but it is an important permanent water source. It's about 12 kilometres from the mine site. Its exact location of renewal, where the water comes from, is the subject of some debate, as is often the case with things that happen underground—and a lot of science has to be done. Again, we know a lot more about the Doongmabulla Springs, the original springs, thanks to the work that Adani has done, which has been checked by the CSIRO and by Geoscience Australia. It all went through a rigorous process, showing what Adani has to do. Adani have to monitor water sites around the mine and make sure that the Doongmabulla Springs continues to be renewed and stays as a permanent water course for that area. All of that work has been assessed. All of that was assessed by experts like the state government Department of Environment and Science, the federal government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia. All of those assessments came back saying that this mine could occur and that we could meet our robust environmental laws.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, I return to the point that, for the Greens, it's not about the local environment—it's not about the Doongmabulla Springs or the black-throated finch. If they cared for the finch they'd welcome the funding that Adani has put aside for this bird. For the Greens, it's all about ending the coal industry. That is what this bill is about. It's not about protecting the local environment. It's not even about protecting the global environment, which I will come to. It's about ending an industry that employs thousands of Australians, that provides billions of royalties to state governments to fund public services and that provides billions of taxes to our country. The Greens want to end the coal industry because it is their political platform. It's a political propaganda that they have engaged in that they see some kind of political benefit from. It's not about the global environment. If it were about the global environment, why do the Greens never mention the contribution of Australia's coalmining industry to the globe's production of coal?</span>

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection. Senator Waters is claiming in her interjections that the Australian coal industry has a huge impact on the world's coal production. These figures are not in debate; it is very easy to establish these—and Senator Waters is free to go and Google and find out this for herself. Australia's coal industry produces five per cent of the world's thermal coal—five per cent!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will come in here and say, 'We're a large exporter.' We are a large exporter. There's not a lot of coal traded exported across the sea, because it's heavy and it's costly to do so. Most coal is used close to where the electricity, heat or whatever is generated out of it is made. So, while we produce five per cent of the world's coal, China produces 50 per cent of the world's coal and uses almost all of their coal in their own country. India's coal production is more than double our coal production. The United States produces more coal than we do, and so does Russia. We are not a large coal producer when it comes to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we export our coal? Why are we a big exporter? As I said, coal is quite heavy, and it is costly to freight and transport. It has only been in the last 50 years or so that the world has established a seaborne coal trade. Before that, the world's industrial revolution all happened with domestic sources of coal. The reason we export our product to the world, the reason we bear all those costs, is that we have an extremely high-quality product. We have high-quality coal that is rich in energy and low in ash, nitrous oxide and sulphur oxides. That is good for the environment, and the reason people are willing to pay high prices for our coal is that environmental benefit as well as the energy content that is inherent in that coal. That's why we export that coal: because it has that high energy content, it means you produce fewer carbon emissions for the burning of the same amount of coal and generate the same amount of electricity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if we as a parliament were to pass this bill, denying the world our efficient, productive, environmentally beneficial energy resources, it would be a bad thing for the world's development and for the world's environment, because if you take away the coal that comes from the Galilee Basin, which is roughly—it varies—5,500 kilocalories per kilogram, you would be left with Indian coal. Senator Waters seems to support the Indian government not buying Australian coal but using their own coal. India's coal is typically around 3,500 kilocalories per kilogram, so our coal is about 50 per cent more efficient than India's coal. So you'll be delivering 50 per cent higher carbon emissions to the world if you use Indian coal compared to Australian coal. Those are the facts that the Greens do not like to hear.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. If I had the opportunity, I wouldn't be calling it disorderly, because they're helping me progress this argument. The Greens seem to be claiming that there's an issue with trying to make poor people rich and trying to help those who are less fortunate than us. The fact is that we have over our generation, over the last 30 years, had this remarkable development where poverty in our region, the Asia-Pacific region, has gone from where it was 30 years ago, when two-thirds of people in the region lived on less than US$1.90, to today, when that figure is 2.3 per cent. In 30 years—or 35 years now—it has gone to 2.3 per cent. Over that period of time, fossil fuel use in our region has gone up to a level more than eight times as high, and coal use is more than six times as high, helping fuel that economic growth, that opportunity and that advancement that has helped poor people who are less fortunate than us have a better life. That is what our coal industry provides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that, while the Carmichael mine is the one proceeding in the basin, there are other proposals. There are five other mines that are in various stages of environmental approval. There are other mines that Senator Waters mentioned that aren't in that process yet. All of those six mines together, including the Carmichael mine, could deliver 16,000 jobs directly in our coalmining industry. The coalmining industry employs 50,000 people at the moment, and it powers the vast majority of the economic wealth of Central Queensland. Now we have an opportunity to increase that by, potentially, a third and deliver even better results and more opportunities for our people here as well as providing those benefits overseas. That's why we should be supporting this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I end, I note that, as Senator Waters said, I don't think this bill is going to come to a vote today. I'd be happy to bring it to a vote, because I'd like to see where the Australian Labor Party fall on this issue. Since the election, they have purported to somehow support the coalmining industry and the export of our coal, but then last week they said they're going to have net zero emissions by 2050. Over the weekend, we've been hearing we can have net zero emissions and still have coalmining as well. What a joke! What a fairytale that Anthony Albanese and the Labor Party are trying to tell the Australian people!</span>

You can't have all your cake and eat it too. If you want to have a coalmining industry, you can't say we're going to join radical countries around the world and try to cut carbon emissions to zero in 30 years. Then we have this magical concept that we're going to still keep coalmining but then we're just going to plant a whole lot of trees on farmland and take away farmers' right as compensation. That is the policy of the Labor Party. We have either one or the other. If we have net zero emissions, we've got to shut down the coalmining industry or take away property rights from farmers and put a lot of trees on their land, which would reduce our cotton, rice and sugar production, to pay some kind of penance or buy some kind of indulgence in order to have the continuing ability to produce cheap and affordable energy for the world that can help develop people who are less fortunate that us. That is, now, the once proud Australian Labor Party, which was established in Central Queensland, in Barcaldine, defending shearers' rights, and which purported to defend workers' rights throughout its very proud history of well over 100 years. It is now selling out workers on the global altar of purporting to say something—not do something—about the issue of climate change.</span>

We have a choice. We can reduce our carbon emissions, but we can't do it in the radical way the Australian Labor Party is proposing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  My, my! I feel like I should put my seatbelt on now, because here comes the mother of all scare campaigns from those opposite. They can't help themselves. But that's an argument for another day. I rise to speak against—I say that very clearly, Senator Canavan: against—the Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018. I note this was introduced as a private senator's bill by Senator Waters on 5 December 2018, and it was sent into committee the next day. It lapsed due to the recent general election and has been placed back on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> recently, hence the debate now. For the record, the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee recommended that the Senate not pass this bill. On this side of the chamber we have our own reasons—I'm talking about the Australian Labor Party, not the little cabal in the corner there, but this side here, the main side—for opposing this attempted legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at this. The prominent objective of this bill is contained in the title. It seeks to prohibit thermal coal mining in the Galilee Basin, which is a large Queensland coal resource which lies some 300-odd kilometres inland from Gladstone. The bill is quite specific about its prohibitions. One: it applies to constitutional corporations. Two: it applies to thermal coal which is used to generate electricity. Three: it even names the Adani Carmichael mine, which intends to mine around 10 million tonnes of coal per year for the Indian electricity sector. The bill also prohibits any proposal from a company owned by other Australians. The penalty for mining thermal coal from the Galilee Basin would be two years in prison or 1,000 penalty units. Any company that has already invested in the basin would be compensated on what Australians call 'just terms'. That's quite clear: no mining of the Galilee Basin; no coal; no Adani. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rationale behind this bill, according to Senator Waters's speech in this place on 5 December 2018, is to keep global emissions below a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius on pre-industrial levels. The senator claims that, if the entire Galilee Basin were to be developed as a mine, it would add some 700 million tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, whereas Australia currently produces 400 million tonnes a year. According to Senator Waters and the Australian Greens, the only way to stop global warming rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius is to, in their words, 'keep coal in the ground'. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' rationale raises some factual issues. Firstly, the Greens' scenario entails the entire Galilee Basin being mined, which it is not. There is one project with an approval in that basin. We all know that's the Adani Carmichael mine. It intends, as I said earlier, to mine 10 million tonnes per year in phase 1 of its operation. Ten million tonnes is not a small coalmine, but it's not what you would call huge. Existing Australian coalmines such as Blackwater and Peak Downs produce around 12 million tonnes per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem with the Greens' rationale for the bill is that they want to count emissions that are not created in Australia. Adani is exporting all of its coal to Indian power generators—a country where around 300 million people have no access to utility-scale power. I point out that the Paris climate agreement makes each signatory nation responsible for its own national emissions and responsible for its emission reduction commitments. The IPCC has a territorial emissions accounting system, which counts only the emissions produced within a country's borders. This is the system used to measure the Kyoto and Paris agreements. There is also the system that our own Department of the Environment and Energy uses to plot Australian greenhouse gas emissions. Australia can't be responsible for India's emissions any more than Australia can shirk its responsibilities for emissions created by imported gasoline and aviation fuel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several other points to be made about the Galilee Basin bill, and the most obvious are economic. Our resources sector is an important industry. Resources made $290 billion worth of exports in the last financial year and account for more than 50 per cent of Australian exports by value. How does the resources sector do this? It takes a workforce of more than 240,000 people—around 1.1 million people when you factor in the associated resources businesses and the services sector. More than half of the resources sector's employees live in regional Australia, making it a cornerstone of many regional economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 52,000 Australians working in the coalmining industry. These are highly skilled people who earn more than the average wage. Resources employees earn, on average, $2,659 per week, which is 65 per cent higher than the national average wage. And 67 per cent of the minerals workforce hold a certificate III level qualification or higher, and apprentices and trainees make up four per cent of the national workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The resources sector has a higher proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working for it than any other industry. The mining sector employed 6,599 Indigenous Australians in 2016, which is 3.9 per cent of Indigenous employees. That's 2½ times the number that were employed in 2006. By comparison, non-Indigenous mining employment grew by 1½ times over the same period. More than 60 per cent of Australian minerals projects neighbour Indigenous communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are broader economic benefits attributable to the mining industry. Deloitte Access Economics say that the mining industry paid $185 billion in federal company tax and state and territory royalties between 2006 and 2016. In the financial year ending 2017, the minerals sector paid $12.1 billion in company tax and $11.2 billion in royalties, making the resources sector the second-largest contributor to company tax revenue. Labor welcomes the royalties and taxes paid by mining companies. They fund our education and health sectors and make possible so much of our civil infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Projects such as the Adani mine in the Galilee Basin also require a lot of investment in the form of capital expenditure. This is the investment you make upfront before you earn any revenue. Most of that investment is foreign direct investment, which is known as FDI. The mining sector relies on foreign direct investment. According to DFAT, there was $365.5 billion of FDI in Australian mining in 2018, which was 37.8 per cent of all FDI in Australia. The Queensland government has estimated that, for every $1 billion in FDI into Australia, 1,000 jobs are created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most senators would know that one of the many drivers of FDI in Australia is low sovereign risk. Indeed, CSIRO has nominated our favourable environment with 'social-economic and political stability, with supportive national policies and services' as a competitive advantage for Australia when attracting investment. Given this global advantage we should all be concerned with actions that put Australia's reputation at risk, such as with proposed laws that can nullify or expropriate significant capital investments. Labor is committed to maintaining a positive sovereign risk profile for Australian mining because, without foreign direct investment, we wouldn't have the resources sector as we know it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also acknowledges that the Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018 has the potential to be inconsistent with the Constitution, which prohibits expropriation without just compensation and therefore potentially leaves the Australian government liable for compensation payments. Labor does not support actions, policies or legislation which would have the effect of stripping investors of lawfully held assets, titles, tenements and/or approvals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also recognise that Australia already has a high-quality system of approvals and oversight when it comes to unlocking our resources. These approvals are run by the state, territory and Commonwealth governments, and they are predominantly driven by independent, evidence based agencies and highly professional, experienced people. So, given the number of Queensland and Commonwealth hurdles that the Adani company has had to jump, not to mention the court challenges and ministerial decisions, we, meaning Labor, don't believe it's advantageous to this nation in the long term to have legislation that singles out companies and even people for prohibition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are these: Australia is a country that digs up minerals and extracts oil and gas, and we sell these products to the world. These products bring good jobs and make us a truly wealthy nation, with a capacity to fund the best in health care, education and public infrastructure. Adani has done nothing wrong. The company seems to have met all of our approvals criteria. The company says it will create around 1,500 jobs in central Queensland and will eventually inject no less than $21 billion into the Australian economy. It is building rail infrastructure, and the mine will have an operating life of up to 90 years. These are not inconsiderable benefits for regional Australians. Because this issue focuses so strongly on emissions, let's remember that the Adani company is also investing in renewables. It has a solar farm at Moranbah, which can power up to 23,000 homes. It is building an even larger solar facility in Whyalla, South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why am I talking about renewables? It is because Labor is committed to renewable energy and greenhouse gas abatement strategies that keep Australia in line with the Paris climate agreement's attempt to keep global warming beneath two degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. Labor will pursue policies that ensure Australia has net zero emissions by 2050—no surprise. However, Australian coal is exported to the Asia-Pacific market, both thermal and metallurgical coal, because of that region's need for cheap, reliable power generation and for steelmaking. The International Energy Agency, in its <span style="font-style:italic;">World energy outlook 2018</span>, noted that, because of Asia-Pacific demand, Australian coal exports would grow by 20 per cent by 2040. Australia will continue to earn revenues by selling high-quality coal to the Asia-Pacific so that they can develop their economies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the development of renewables as part of Australia's future energy solutions. Unlike Senator Canavan, the former resources minister, who we just heard from, Labor does not see renewables as 'dole bludgers'. Large resources companies are already investing in renewables and future energy technologies. Shell's new commercial solar farm project in Queensland is a real example of how the resources sector is ensuring that it is part of the renewable energy future. The Gangarri solar project is a partnership with the local tradition owners, the Yiman people. The project will provide rewarding jobs and training opportunities, building capacity and support for local community groups. It will produce 120 megawatts, which is enough energy to power 50,000 homes and reduce emissions by 300,000 tonnes per year. This is a good thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another renewable project in WA is the Agnew goldmine, which will be home to Australia's largest hybrid renewable energy microgrid and the first mine site to use wind generation. According to Agnew, the microgrid will have a total power generation capacity of 54 megawatts, including 19 megawatts of gas and diesel, 18 megawatts of wind, four megawatts of solar and 13 megawatts of battery storage—Adani's Whyalla and Moranbah renewables projects are in keeping with this investment. It's also striving to be a leading supplier of renewable energy in Australia. It's an example of how the resources sector is doing its bit to get the balance right in our future energy solutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia should be a leader in reducing emissions. Australia should be a leader in finding solutions for other countries who also want to reduce their emissions, even as Labor does not support providing public funding or concessional loans for the development of the Galilee Basin. If investments or developments are to occur, they must stack up financially without public assistance. However, Australia has a role to play in ensuring that countries who do not enjoy access to electricity are able to, due to our resources sector. The Greens don't have the right to pick and choose who will have access to reliable and affordable power, and they don't have the right to destabilise what is a successful and stable investment environment for resources and energy projects in our proud nation. Labor opposes the bill.</span>

                    <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  This proposal by Greens Senator Larissa Waters to prohibit the mining of thermal coal in Queensland's Galilee Basin will financially ruin my home state of Queensland. Some 36,000 Queensland coalmining jobs rely on this industry, and you can safely say tens of thousands of additional jobs also trade off the back of the Queensland coal industry. This bill, the Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018, not only reflects the Greens' attitude towards coal and mine workers but it's also a carbon copy of Jackie Trad's and Labor's Palaszczuk government's approach to the industry. The Labor Party in Queensland have established a 'just transition' group which is designed to make baristas out of coalminers and take their salaries of $100,000 or more to just $24.29 an hour. Without mining in Queensland, we have zero chance of paying off the $90-plus billion debt the state government—a Labor government—has racked up. This Greens bill to prohibit the mining of thermal coal in Queensland's Galilee Basin will not only shut down 247,000 square kilometres of the Galilee Basin in Queensland but also kill many towns I have spent a lot of time in, like Rockhampton, Yeppoon, Cawarral, Sarina, Mackay, Moranbah, Nebo, Glenden, Dysart, Proserpine, Bowen, Ayr, Townsville and Belyando Crossing. These are just a few of the towns the Greens have sentenced to a slow but sure death, and I won't tolerate it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, well before I was elected to the Senate, I watched property prices plummet by 62 per cent in Moranbah because there was a slump in mining. The downturn in coalmining sent countless hardworking families to the wall. These were families who were prepared to move out of the city and live in regional Queensland to make sure city slickers like Senator Waters and her Greens colleagues can live in their coal powered cities. These little mining towns lost countless businesses too. They'll never go back. The reality is the world is still embracing coal-fired power stations. Even The Australia Institute, who are no friends of coal, have conceded there are no fewer than 154 new coal-fired power stations under construction across the globe. Add to that more than 1,000 additional coal-fired power stations on the drawing boards of many other nations across the world. Some of these countries include Germany, Japan, Indonesia, India and the European Union. Most are signatories to the Paris Agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Galilee Basin will offer the whole of Australia and countries across the globe cheap, affordable base-load power, and there is no denying that. The Greens are completely reckless with their ill-conceived policies, and this bill should be sent to the shredder, never to be seen again. The Greens will stop at nothing to shut down coal. They continue to lie about the destruction of our Great Barrier Reef, using fake photos. They make out coal is killing our koalas and starting bushfires. The Greens are full of it, and the sooner Australians wake up to their rot the better. One Nation will not support the shutdown of the mining industry in Queensland and will, therefore, vote against the Greens bill to prohibit the mining of thermal coal in Queensland's Galilee Basin. But One Nation is pushing for a coal-fired power station at Collinsville where there used to be one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually are supplying power across Queensland, and, when they run out of power in the southern states, they rely on Queensland to supply that power. A known fact is that solar panels are not the answer to delivering the power that we need in Queensland. They have 2,000 acres outside Collinsville with 453,000 panels. Those panels are not delivering the power that they need to because the rats are chewing the wires. It is a constant problem that they have. At Kogan Creek, the state and federal governments invested $110 million into solar panels. Not one milliamp of power was delivered to the power station beside them, yet now they're being dismantled. Look at South Australia and the $600 million invested in solar panels or the wind farms that are not even connected up because they can't deliver reliable power. What does Australia do when, just like over the last couple of weeks, it is overcast and there is rain? There was no power coming from the solar panels. So we do need a diversity of power, but in shutting down the power stations in Australia or across the world—because that's what you are doing by prohibiting coal—the fact is that we won't have that reliable, dispatchable, cheap power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've travelled across my state quite extensively and spoken to business owners. Because they have to have a mix and because of the escalating power prices in Australia, we are seeing our industries and manufacturing shutting down to go overseas. We will see a further loss of jobs. And I'm fed up with hearing the Greens—and much of it is said on the floor of this parliament—absolutely telling our younger generation about the threat that coal poses to our Great Barrier Reef. Professor Peter Ridd, who has worked on the reef for 35 years, has said, 'Coalmining has no effect on the reef.' Actually he has said, 'The reef is in great shape.' There's only about one per cent of it that has been subject to coral bleaching, and it's not from coalmining. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. With all the fearmongering that goes on in this place, the Greens have never debated and put their argument forward. And that's the problem within Australia: we have listened to the fearmongers and we have never had an actual debate and heard from the scientists about what global warming is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in accordance with their charter, will actually only look at man-made climate change. They will not look at any other climate change whatsoever. It's not in their charter. So we have not been told the truth. Here we are making policies for our country for the future generations and our businesses, and we are not being told the truth. We need to debate this. We need to know the truth. Our kids' heads are being filled with rubbish by those who are pushing their own agenda. As I said last week about the indoctrination in the education system, climate change has definitely won. When Stewart Dimmock from the UK challenged the education system and his case was put before the courts, the judge was told by the IPCC that the Himalayas were actually melting. That wasn't the case. That was a farce by the media and some group of people who were pushing their own agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a right to a place in this parliament to express our views and concerns, and I don't deny anyone that. But when we are talking about the future generations and whether our pensioners can afford to turn on some heating or cool themselves down and when jobs are going to be lost, I think we need to know the truth. And, if we are wrong, then we admit to that, but we need to have a clear debate on this. The Greens' whole attitude to this is 'shut down coalmining', but there has never been a real debate to understand why. Even the Australian scientists said, 'If we shut down everything in Australia now, it would not make one bit of difference to the global temperature—not one bit.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our emissions are 1.3 per cent. Those are our emissions. And yet we seem to be intent on leading the world on shutting down to stop global warming when we have countries like China and India way above that percentage level—even Canada and New Zealand are. Like I said, this proposal, this bill, by Senator Larissa Waters needs to be shredded. It needs to be thrown into the bin. One Nation will definitely not be supporting it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise in opposition to this Greens bill, the Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018. I start my contribution by saying that as a regionally based senator in Victoria I am incredibly concerned about what bills like this may do if they are ever passed—it doesn't look like there's any prospect of that for this bill—in terms of undermining jobs in our resources sector and in the mining sector, in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposing coalmining in the Galilee Basin, the Greens are putting at risk around 1,500 direct jobs and almost 7,000 supporting jobs at the Adani Carmichael mine. These are real families and communities which depend on a strong and viable resources industry. As I say, this could well be the first of a number of bills from the Greens to totally shut down and abolish mining in Australia. This is an industry which generates $279 billion—these are the 2018-19 figures—with coal itself generating some $70 billion. The Greens policies will put at risk the jobs of nearly 14,000 people employed during construction of mines and associated rail projects, the jobs of more than 11,000 people employed in ongoing roles in the mines and supporting infrastructure and $34 billion invested in bringing the mines into production as well as new infrastructure, including rail infrastructure. The coal industry contributes more than $6 billion annually in royalties across Australia and accounts for over 50,000 direct jobs, with the majority of those jobs in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is quite ironic. It comes at a time when the Labor Party has announced its so-called plan for net zero emissions by 2050, which, as I have already said publicly this morning, is not a plan but a slogan. It's unfunded and uncosted, and I think Australians have every right to feel pretty confused about where Labor sits at the moment. On the one hand, it's talking about zero emissions, with no consideration for the economy-wide impact that that might have, particularly the impact that that might have on coal, steel, aluminium and other extractive industries. So there's no consideration of the broader ramifications. It is talking about this so-called plan—or, as I say, slogan—without any plan whatsoever. It's uncosted. It's unfunded. So, as I say, Australians have every right to be very confused about Labor's position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's reliance on, and alliance with, the Greens continues to threaten Australia's coal industry, which is a key pillar of our economy and which provides cheap and secure electricity and jobs and funds vital services. Labor talks about energy security, including through gas and coal, and yet we have a situation in Victoria where the Victorian Labor government is continuing its moratorium on onshore conventional gas. It says it's okay to extract the gas offshore—the same gas in the same basin—but not onshore. This is an extraction and exploration that does not require fracking. So that particular contention that some make needs to be put to rest. We have a situation where Labor is actively operating to destabilise the energy market in Victoria, including by encouraging the shutdown of Hazelwood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Depending on who you talk to in the Labor Party, you hear a different story. There is a huge internal war going on in the Labor Party. The Otis group has one view and then there are others on the Left who have a very different view. For instance, Mr Fitzgibbon lauds the prospect of Australia's clean and efficient coal on the back of demand in China and India. And then other Labor MPs have repeatedly opposed or undermined the Adani project and the opening up of the Galilee Basin for coalmining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard Senator Sterle speaking in very supportive terms about Adani, and yet that's in stark contrast to what was heard leading up to the election when many Labor MPs, including the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, were condemning Adani. Then, of course, there's Mr Marles, the member for Corio, Labor's deputy leader, who argued that it was a good thing that the thermal coal market would collapse. So here we are: Mr Marles is continuing to ignore the continued demand for thermal coal, especially in the developing economies of Asia, and then we have another very, very different story here in the chamber today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to place on record that the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Butler, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, said 'development of the Galilee Basin is not in Australia's national interest' and declared it would 'not be a positive thing for Australia for the Adani mine to go ahead.' I am not sure how that sits with the contribution that we have just heard from Senator Sterle, but it does reinforce the position that Labor is all at sea when it comes to its position on coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I tell you what, the coalminers of Australia worked it out. They worked it out before the last election—55,000 of them. They worked it out. Whether they work in a coalmine, whether they work in industry, in heavy industries, or whether they work as a manufacturer, they worked out that Labor deserted them in the lead-up to the last election. Their policies were totally contrary to the needs of many blue-collar workers in Australia. They worked out that the only party standing up for them is the Liberal National Party. And it's a bit of a joke when you hear contributions from Senator Sterle after what we have heard in recent months. The Leader of the Opposition went to the north of Sydney and up to Brisbane, telling one story in the north of Queensland and then another very different story when he went down to Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We very much condemn this bill. I want to also place on record that our government is working extremely hard to drive down emissions and is having substantial success, including—and this is the Energy Security Board—delivering renewable investment as a proportion of total energy of 40 per cent by 2030. Last year 16 per cent of supply came from renewables. By 2022 it will be 27 per cent. By 2030 it will be 40 per cent. So very, very substantial investment is going into renewables, driving our renewable energy industry, driving down emissions, but not in a way that will be economy wrecking and not in a way that will undermine our coal and gas industries, which are very important for our entire energy security. I thank the chamber for the opportunity to speak on this bill. I, again, reiterate our opposition to this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I've said this before and I will say this again: I'm very proud to live in regional Queensland, an area that boasts rich resources and natural wonders. Despite the distance between towns and the diversity between each regional community, we are very proud of where we live and the contribution that regional Queenslanders make to Queensland and the national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In North Queensland, you can drive from the Great Barrier Reef and the World Heritage listed rainforests that tourists from all over the world come to see through to cane farms and agricultural land. You can drive past sugar mills and manufacturing hubs, past ports and our marine industry and up to mines and processing refineries for every mineral and resource that we have to offer. Regional Queenslanders understand very deeply the connection between our lands, our environment and our jobs. Regional Queenslanders also understand the threats that climate change and the government's inability to implement genuine policies to combat climate change pose to our economic prosperity and to our livelihoods. Regional Queenslanders have experienced fires, floods, cyclones and higher water temperatures, increasing the costs of recovery and insurance for households.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's policy paralysis on energy has led to instability and uncertainty for jobs and businesses in regional Queensland. We know that climate change is impacting the health of the Great Barrier Reef, which supports thousands of jobs. In Far North Queensland, islands in the Torres Strait are bracing for rising sea levels. They may be Australia's first climate change refugees if predictions of sea level rises are accurate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about climate change in this place, it's never lost on me that the Queenslanders least responsible for the emissions that cause the climate to change are the least equipped to defend against the effects that they will feel before any person in any city who waves a placard around in support of either side of this debate. This dichotomy that lives and breathes in regional Queensland every day is why, in my first speech, I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Job security for Queenslanders and the dangers of climate change are interlinked. Queenslanders want and deserve secure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The only way to win an outcome that ensures a prosperous and healthy future for our state is to listen to Queenslanders, not talk at them or speak about them in abstract terms. Every regional Queenslander deserves to be treated with respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018 doesn't respect regional Queenslanders. It singles out regional Queensland. It doesn't talk about jobs or the future of jobs and it doesn't talk about the economic plan required for Australia to reach emission goals. It doesn't give regional Queenslanders a stake in their prosperity or recognise their right to have their voices heard. This bill singles out regional Queensland unfairly and unjustly for the sole purpose of wedging this parliament and the members of the Labor Party who care about climate change and care about jobs. It is wedge legislation at its very finest—another stunt from the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was less than two minutes into Senator Waters's speech today before she attacked the Labor Party and before she attacked the Queensland state Labor government. So we know what the true purpose of this bill really is. It's about Maiwar; it's not about Moranbah. It's about South Brisbane; it's not about South Johnstone. This is a legislation version of the Greens' convoy to Clermont in the lead-up to the election. And didn't that go so well, as we all know. You would have thought that the Greens had learnt from their catastrophic failings at the last election, but, clearly, they haven't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former senator Bob Brown last week described regional Queenslanders who stood up to the convoy as 'cranky, nasty and inhospitable' and went on to call them an 'unruly mob fuelled by grog'. That's what the Greens think about regional Queenslanders. They haven't learnt their lessons. When there is so much at stake for our country if we don't get climate change settings right, stunts from the Greens are selfish and self-indulgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does nothing to reduce Australians' climate emissions. While alternative sources of energy are being produced in places like regional Queensland, a switch to low emissions can't happen overnight, and this bill isn't actually proposing any plan to make that switch happen. It just wants to turn the switch off overnight. And when it comes to protecting local jobs, this bill is poorly thought out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her second reading speech, Senator Waters said that the Greens were prepared to consult with communities affected by market changes in the demand for thermal coal, but the explanatory memorandum to this bill says that the bill would have no financial impact. We know that that is not true. The truth is the Greens pretend to listen. They pretend to be interested. But I haven't heard them listening to people in Mackay or Townsville or workers who would be affected by a bill like this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What bills like this do is give a platform to the climate change deniers in the government who claim that any action on climate change will result in job losses across places that can afford it the least. It gives them a platform to argue against more renewable energy and for less action on climate change. You will note that Senator Canavan took the opportunity to also attack the Queensland Labor government in his second reading contribution today. It's quite a common theme coming from that end of the chamber. These so-called defenders of coal workers have never stood up to labour hire. They have never stood up against automation. They want to make workplaces less safe, so more people die in coalmines across Queensland. They have never seen a manufacturing job they wouldn't privatise or casualise or send offshore. But they come in here saying they are standing up for coal workers. We know that is not the truth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is, because the government are being held back by climate change sceptics on their backbench, and even on their frontbench now, they have failed to take any meaningful action on emissions. We know that the latest emissions data confirms that the Morrison government's climate change policy is hopelessly inadequate. There was no reduction in emissions in the September quarter of 2019, and annual emissions have reduced by only a pitiful 0.3 per cent year to date. Australia will not meet its Kyoto commitment to cut emissions by five per cent in 2020. In fact, emissions reductions will amount to little more than a rounding error. The government's own data suggests that emissions will come down during the next years but only by less than five per cent. At that rate, it will take Australia 230 years to reach net zero emissions, rather than the 30 years scientists tell us is necessary. While the hard Right of the divided government party room continues to dictate climate policy, there will be no progress in tackling climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been listening and understands that our economy and jobs are at risk if we do not address climate change. That is why Anthony Albanese announced last week that a future Labor government will commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We are doing that in a practical way, with a long-term target, without singling out any community, region or industry. Labor is committing to net zero emissions by 2050 because that is what the science tells us we need to do, to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. This is sensible and will bring us in step with other states and territories, and it is supported by the Business Council of Australia and energy companies because they want certainty. They want a long-term target. It is good policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that this announcement has triggered the climate change deniers in the government and the Greens on this side of the chamber equally, which just shows you how sad and sorry sensible debate in this space has now become. Even though so-called moderate Liberals, like Trent Zimmerman, have called on the government to support net zero emissions by 2050, we've still got members of their government out there banging their pots and pans on their heads and making outlandish doomsday claims. The Greens have also attacked the target. If you have a look at the Twitter feeds of some of the Greens over the last couple of days, it's easy to see who they think the target is at the next election. It's not the conservatives over there, who are doing nothing about climate change; it's the Labor Party, who want to introduce a plan to help workers and prevent further changes in our climate. Regional Queenslanders deserve better than the nonsense coming from that end of the chamber, from both sides of the chamber, on this debate. We need to take action on climate change. We want to create jobs and protect jobs, and only the Australian Labor Party wants to do both. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'll refer back to what I said in my first speech: there are regional Queenslanders, right now, who are desperate for jobs.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I thank those senators who have contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Recovering Unpaid Superannuation) Bill 2019. The government is acting to improve the integrity of the superannuation guarantee. With the introduction of near real-time reporting on superannuation guarantee obligations and payments, the ATO will be able to detect and act on non-payment of workers' entitlements much more effectively going forward. To address historical noncompliance, this bill offers a limited, one-off opportunity to employers to come forward and pay their workers what they are owed. Employers have from 24 May 2018 to six months after this bill receives royal assent to voluntarily come forward and disclose their historical noncompliance without being subjected to penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the passage of the bill, the ATO will update the law administration practice statement that provides guidelines in relation to the remission of additional superannuation guarantee charge imposed under part 7 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The first step of the three-step penalty remission process is to determine the basic level of remission. When updating this practice guidance, it is the expectation of government that the basic level of remission for cases of prompted self-assessment and worse will attract a residual penalty equivalent to 100 per cent of the superannuation guarantee charge, with penalties increasing linearly as the offences become more egregious. The worst cases, where a default assessment has been issued with a severe disengagement and phoenixing arrangement on the part of the employer, should attract the full residual penalty, equivalent to 200 per cent of the superannuation guarantee charge. Only cases of unprompted self-assessment should attract an initial penalty of less than 100 per cent of the SGC. In these cases, where the employer has come forward of their own accord, the government deems it appropriate for the basic level of remission to result in a residual penalty equivalent to 20 per cent of the superannuation guarantee charge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be crystal clear. The government has absolutely no tolerance for superannuation theft. This is the very last chance that employers will have to come forward and receive concessional penalty treatment. After the amnesty concludes the ATO will take an extremely dim view of those employers that could have come forward but have failed to do so. Those employers will be subjected to penalties equal to at least 100 per cent of their noncompliance. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

The benefits of the amnesty have been publicly communicated already by the government, both as part of the original announcement and by the ATO through its broader communications activities. Once legislation passes and receives royal assent, it will be communicated publicly to employers by the government and by the ATO. The ATO has advised that there is a significant communications plan in place for the amnesty, which is planned to commence following royal assent. More importantly, the ATO web content will be updated and the SG amnesty form will be made available to employers for employers to apply. The ATO intends to have this published within 24 hours of royal assent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, external messaging is being finalised ready for release across multiple channels. That includes through ministerial media releases; the ATO's website, ato.gov.au; and the ATO media. A video will also be made available on the ATO website and shared via social media channels and through ATO newsrooms and public relations activities. There will be PR through third-party channels as well, including other government agencies, tax and BAS agents and industry associations. There are plans for an ATO public notice of formal announcement—so there's paid advertising; social media newsrooms; emails to stewardship groups; internal communications to ATO staff; and direct correspondence with those that have come forward previously. So it's quite a comprehensive program of communications.</span>

And I'm very grateful to the crossbench for the constructive way that they engaged in that proposal. Crossbench senators have, I think, granted the government time. As I understand it, they have said: 'This is an idea which is good in its essence. We are willing to grant the government time.' That's not our preferred approach—we think we can proceed immediately—but it's the view of the crossbench. You're willing to brief them about this constructive idea that we have presented to the chamber, but you're not willing to brief us about it. Is that correct?</span>

Not once has this issue been raised. It wasn't raised in the opposition's additional comments or dissenting reports on either occasion. This is a brand new idea, and we're just beginning to put our minds around it. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing for crossbenchers to say, 'Hey, I don't know anything about this but, if you can investigate it, come back to us and talk to us about it.' I think that we're approaching it with a reasonably open mind and in good faith. So I don't think this is a reasonable request.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I don't think that seems like a very good-faith approach to unscrambling a problem. We've got billions of dollars in superannuation not being paid to ordinary workers. We've put a constructive proposal on the table. I think making a discussion with the opposition about that proposal hostage to some procedural demand that you have today is petty and rather unfortunate. I've asked you to consider it or to reconsider your position. You've refused to do so, and there's probably no point in discussing it much further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now move to the amendment. As I said, I appreciate that the crossbench engaged constructively with us. We think this is a constructive idea that, unlike the bill that is presently before this chamber, would actually do something about unpaid superannuation, which in some cases amounts to deliberate theft from hardworking people. For clarity, the amendment that we've circulated would include the right to superannuation within the National Employment Standards, and that would give all employees to the power to pursue their unpaid superannuation. Currently, unpaid or underpaid employer contributions are a debt that's owed by the employer to the tax office rather than the worker. Unless there is a clause in the award or the agreement that covers that worker, the worker can't chase that money as an individual because the debt technically isn't owed to them. This bill seeks to fix that, because it doesn't really work. If a worker is not paid their super, what happens then is that they submit a claim to the ATO. Workers who lodge claims with the ATO may not see action for months or years or ever at all, with very little information given to those people as to why. Actually, the ATO is restricted in the information it can provide to workers, so it doesn't share details of any payment plan that might have been arrived at with an employer, nor does it allow anyone to contest the employer's claim if they say that they do not have capacity to repay in a reasonable time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a small problem. The amount of unpaid super, as I alluded to earlier, is staggering. A report from Industry Super Australia has found that 2.94 million workers, a big group of workers, lose $5.95 billion each year in unpaid super. It's outrageous, and blue-collar workers are the ones who are most likely to be ripped off. Machinery operators and drivers, labourers, technicians and trade workers make up more than one million workers whose super is underpaid. Just under one in three community and personal service workers have their super stolen, amounting to more than $468 million. These are some of the most poorly paid workers in our system, doing hard and important work in the community services sector. It is outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This does represent a fix. Placing super within the National Employment Standards and the Fair Work Act means all employees will be empowered to recoup unpaid super from employers through the Fair Work Commission or through the Federal Court. It would allow them to seek unpaid superannuation in the same way workers can seek unpaid wages. Workers and their unions should have the right to pursue unpaid superannuation as an industrial entitlement. They should have the ability to inspect records of payment. If the government were serious about unpaid super, it would actually support this amendment today and it would ensure that superannuation provisions in the National Employment Standards to allow workers to enforce their rights at work are put into place. I seek leave to move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8872 revised together.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I should have put on the record the reason the government opposes this amendment, which is that, while it acknowledges that super theft is a disgrace, the government has worked tirelessly to ensure the integrity of the superannuation guarantee. Most importantly and most recently that was by extending Single Touch Payroll to businesses with fewer than 20 employees, ensuring the ATO has real-time reporting of contributions received by super funds and strengthening the commissioner's ability to collect superannuation guarantee charges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always encouraged people across the parliament to come to me with their policy ideas, knowing I'll carefully examine them on their merits and in good faith. If you are genuinely serious about an idea and you think it's a good policy, you shouldn't be scared to come forward and have it stand up to considered scrutiny. This Treasury Laws Amendment (Recovering Unpaid Superannuation) Bill 2019, as I said, has been to committee twice already—in this parliament and in the last—and, despite it being mooted in testimony before the committee, this idea was not at all recommended by either the majority or the dissenting reports on the bill. Furthermore, it was within the terms of reference of the Senate Economics References Committee's inquiry into superannuation underpayment in the 45th Parliament, chaired by a Labor senator. Again, there was absolutely nothing on this included in its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as a result, the amendment that was proposed had no opportunity for proper scrutiny. The only reason it should be put up now is as a bad-faith attempt to scuttle a very good bill. It would have been a legislative and regulatory quagmire. Furthermore, the Fair Work Act does not have 100 per cent coverage of Australian employees, with state and local government employees not covered, along with some private sector employees. We felt this policy on the run was policy underdone.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  Labor supports the passage of the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019. The bill's primary purpose is to allow Wine Australia to establish a label directory, which will include digital colour images of grape product labels and information in relation to the grape products and those exporting them, to enable Wine Australia to use the label directory as a part of its role in controlling the export of grape products under the act and regulations. According to the explanatory memorandum the purpose of the label directory is to deter exports of copycat wine from Australia. This is a good thing, as copycats of our great Australian wines have a massive impact on our wine producers. Copycats should not gain commercial benefit from the high-quality Australian brand that our wine producers have developed. It's their hard work that created the brand. This should be protected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is important to note that the bill does not give Wine Australia the power to protect the intellectual property rights of wine brand owners. The bill will only better facilitate wine brand owners to protect their own interests by being able to search the database to easily see whether other labels may be seeking to trade off their intellectual property so they can undertake appropriate civil action against copycat exporters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enables Wine Australia to take into account the behaviour of wine exporters using the label directory in administering licences to export grape products. That means that when exporters are trying to take advantage of the good name of Australian brands or using untruthful or noncompliant labels Wine Australia can suspend or cancel their licence to export. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, whilst the bill before the parliament will assist wine producers to better protect their brand from copycat behaviour, many wine producers are concerned about the impact that climate change is having on their industry and Australia's wine industry's reputation. This is why I will be moving a second reading amendment condemning the government for its lack of understanding about the impact climate change is having on Australia's wine industry. The rapidly changing climate is having a significant impact on the agriculture sector, and viticulturists want the government to act meaningfully on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many viticulturists, the recent fires have had a significant impact on their wine-producing regions. On 9 January 2020, the peak industry organisation, the grape and wine association, Australian Grape and Wine—known as AGW—provided an update on the impacts that the bushfires have had on various wine-producing regions. In terms of the effects on the Hunter Valley region and the 2020 vintage it really is still too early to tell. The update reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Smoke taint is a reasonably new and inexact body of science, and the region is currently working through all the options and procedures at their disposal to evaluate any perceived risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, experienced wine producers, such as Bruce Tyrrell, have had to make difficult decisions to ensure the brand of their wines, stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the company had decided most of its vineyards would not be harvested for wine production and it would have a severely reduced 2020 vintage. Overall the drought and smoke taint would bring a grape crush 80 per cent below normal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further adding:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Smoke taint gives grapes—especially reds—burnt, smoky, medicinal or "dirty ash tray" characters that are reproduced in the wines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of south-eastern Victoria has been subject to fire. Gippsland has suffered severely, and Rutherglen, King Valley, Beechworth and the alpine regions are vulnerable in the next few weeks. This could bring up to 10,000 tonnes under threat.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department of agriculture has officially changed to its new structure as the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. The department also obtained two new ministers, albeit Minister Littleproud was given back his old job. Minister Pitt is the new water minister—and hopefully the working relationship between Minister Littleproud and Minister Pitt will be a better working relationship than what existed between Minister Littleproud and the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator McKenzie—and Andrew Metcalfe was reinstated as the secretary to the department of agriculture, after the Abbott government sacked him back in 2013. But these changes cannot be used as an excuse by the government to continue to not act on assisting farmers to build resilience and to adapt to the challenges that climate change presents. The Morrison government love to blame bureaucrats or the states for policy failings. However, the Public Service is there to serve the government of the day, and this can only be done if there is a clear mandate from the government of the day. Changing ministers and departmental secretaries, and moving portfolios, do nothing to assist our farmers dealing with the challenges of climate change.</span>

Yet now both agriculture and water can sit with the environment department. So the question is: why did the water portfolio need to be moved in the first place? It was purely for National Party optics. Remember that locating water in the agriculture department and under the responsibility of the then minister Barnaby Joyce was the deal done when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was knifed in the back. Of course, leadership instability continues to plague the coalition, as the National Party almost—almost!—saw the return of Mr Joyce to the helm. Whilst Mr Joyce did not get across the line this time, it did expose the fractures that continue to exist in the Liberal and National parties with regard to climate change policies. </span>

The recent rains around Australia, which are welcomed by all, should not be used as an excuse by the Morrison government to do nothing. The agriculture sector, including fisheries and forestry, want a coherent national strategy for agriculture. This plan will need to include meaningful action on climate change; otherwise their vision of reaching $100 billion by 2030 will be difficult to achieve.</span>

We know that Australia has a very significant wine industry and a very significant wine export industry. Based on the recent data in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span>, we produce around 1.7 million tonnes of wine grapes a year, we consume 492 million litres of wine a year, we export 866 million litres of wine and we imported 100 million litres of wine. Over time Australia's largest export markets have shifted from being predominantly the US and the UK to a greater volume going to China and South-East Asia. </span>

This bill is intended to address situations like that situation. This bill enables Wine Australia to create a directory of labels as part of export controls—all very good. The Greens are going to be supporting this bill because, yes, it's a useful thing to be doing, but we do question the priorities of the government. We do question whether this is actually the most important thing to be tackling to support our wine industry. The coalition is being quick to protect Australia's wine industry when it comes to protecting the intellectual property of our major producers but there is a massive looming challenge. There is a massive elephant in the vineyard that the coalition is failing to act on and that is our climate emergency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the impact that our climate emergency has had on wine growers this summer. With the fire emergency that we faced we need to look no further than right here around Canberra where we have Canberra wine growers who are basically saying, 'There's no vintage this year because of the fires around Canberra.' Tim Kirk is from Clonakilla wines, who are based in Murrumbateman. They usually produce between 15,000 and 20,000 cases of wine each year. They made what they describe as the 'painful' decision to not have a 2020 vintage. 'It's been pretty devastating actually,' said Mr Kirk. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've had bushfires before, but this was something else. The fires all around us, we just seemed to cop all of smoke and it hung around for weeks and weeks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">What happens is it sits on the skins of the grapes and gets sucked into the grapes as they start to ripen. Once you crush the grapes and begin to ferment them, those smoke compounds are released into the wine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There you go. This is the real emergency. This is the real issue that wine growers in Australia need to have this government addressing. If we don't address the climate emergency no amount of fiddling around the edges and providing registers of wine labels is going to mean the ongoing financial viability of our wine industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This summer we had the issue of smoke taint. It's not just in Canberra where it was felt. With our fires that we've had this year we know that fires of this extremity, fires of this intensity, the longer fire season, the smoke hanging around, are going to be signs of things to come unless we address our climate emergency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have got the issue of the hotter conditions—the rising temperatures that come with climate change. I would like to talk about a study that I have got a particular personal connection to, which my late wife, Dr Penny Whetton, was an author of in her role as being one of Australia's leading climate scientists. It was a paper entitled 'Observed trends in wine grape maturity in Australia' published nine years ago now in <span style="font-style:italic;">Global Change Biology</span> in 2011. That research was based on studying data from vineyards around Australia over very long time frames. Some of it was from over 115 years of data. It showed very clearly the impact that a hotter climate was having on our wines. Over the 1993-2009 period the grapes matured, on average, 1.7 days earlier each year. Crucially, the paper summarises:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The trend to earlier maturity was associated with warming temperature trends for all of the blocks assessed in the study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is what we need to be addressing. This is the urgent issue. This is where there needs to be urgent action from everybody in this place—the government, the Labor Party, the crossbench and certainly us Greens. You know that we want to see the urgent action, of the speed and scales that are required, in order to rapidly reduce our carbon pollution to zero. And it is not just about just leaving it until 2050—net zero carbon by 2050. Look, that may be great, but it also may be too late. We need urgent action now, not just fiddling around at the edges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting aside the whole issue of the impact of our climate crisis on grapes and focusing on new wine labels: the experience of our wine growers with the increasing impact of our climate crisis shows that, tragically, it is being felt now. Just as the fires showed that we are in a climate crisis, there is no escaping it. The impact of those fires was felt, and so is the impact of a hotter climate being felt. Alisdair Tulloch, from Keith Tulloch Wine, stated: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">You need to pull the camera back further than the bushfires themselves and the way they are influenced by climate change to look at the broader picture of grape growing in general. Grape growing has been showing the fingerprints of climate change since the 1980s when the harvesting dates began to move forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course we know that the climate crisis has affected not just the wine industry. It's affecting our agriculture sector more broadly. A recent report by ABARES estimated that climate-related losses are on average about $1.1 billion per year for the broadacre property industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there was any other factor—whether it was invasive species, coalmining or another issue—that was costing farmers over $1 billion a year, surely this government would be acting to address that issue. Instead, we're being told: 'Don't worry. We've got it under control. We're going to meet our Paris targets, and everything's okay.' But it is blatantly clear to everybody—you cannot fool the community—that the action that is needed, that is required to reduce our carbon pollution, is needed much more urgently and at a much greater speed and scale than this government is doing. While we've got a government that continues to be spruiking coal, to be spruiking the opening up of the Beetaloo Basin, to be fracking gas, we are not addressing our climate emergency. We are not addressing the impacts of climate change on agriculture. We are not addressing the impacts of climate change on our wine industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what needs to happen if we are concerned about not just our environmental viability but also the economic viability of this country. On any other issue that was causing losses of $1.1 billion a year, this coalition government would be acting to address it. There'd be a special envoy, there'd be a series of summits and the minister would make announcements of multimillion-dollar government programs. There would be at least an attempt at action. But this government's not acting on the climate emergency. And do you know why? Because while they talk up big about supporting farmers, we know who is really pulling the strings. We know who they are listening to, and that is their fossil fuel donors—the coal dinosaurs who will not accept the truth or act on it, and a Prime Minister who still fondles lumps of coal and refuses to engage on the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2007—if you want to go to the impact that climate change is having on our agricultural industry—the Howard government's drought package included exit packages worth $150,000 to farmers. This is what one scientist commented in 2007. Professor Peter Cullen, of the Wentworth group of scientists, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this would enable farmers to exit the land with dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is going through a horrible transition as we adjust to climate change and there are places where farming isn't going to be able to be continued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the issues. This is what this government needs to be focusing on, rather than just fiddling around the edges with small things like putting together a register of wine labels. Yes, a register of wine labels is all very good, but it is tiny in significance compared with what we need to be doing on our climate emergency. More recently, the National Farmers Federation called for exit packages as well. Fiona Simson, the head of the NFF, said of exit packages that they would:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… provide some support for those people making the difficult decision and enable them to establish themselves in a new location, with a new future in front of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government could be exploring exit packages as a way to make land sustainable and supporting farmers in the middle of our climate emergency. Instead, it's continuing to bury its head in the sand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need leadership from our government. That's what the community want. They want leadership. They want action, not just fiddling at the margin with export labels, to be meaningfully addressing our climate emergency. So the Greens will be supporting this bill. It's a bit of legislation that, yes, is going to go some way to improving things—to stop fake wine labels being used abroad, protecting our wine producers—but it is tiny in the larger scheme of what needs to be addressed to ensure a positive, robust and sustainable future for our wine industry, for our agricultural sector more generally and for all of us—for us, our children and our grandchildren.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019. It's one that supports Australia's wine producers and the integrity of their product. Australia is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world and the fifth-largest wine exporter, with two-thirds of Australian wine exported, adding $2.89 billion to the economy annually and employing over 170,000 workers in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My great home state of Victoria has a fantastic wine industry, one of the best in the world. There are over 1,100 wine producers in Victoria, with over 740 vineyards spread right across the state. The people here and those listening at home might be familiar with some of these regions—the Yarra Valley, the Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas, Rutherglen, Pyrenees, Goulburn Valley and more. These predominantly small and medium businesses employ nearly 13,000 workers in both direct production and associated industries. Some of those industries include tourism. They contribute over $7.6 billion to Victoria's economy. They supply 19 per cent of Australia's wine production to a range of producers who export right across the world. Their hard work, innovation, experimentation and high-quality production has seen Victoria develop an enviable reputation as a producer of high-quality varietals of all types, some of which now challenge and beat the traditional exporters from Europe and North America.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this kind of hard work and success that the Morrison government want to support. We've boosted the Export Market Development Grants scheme by $60 million to back small and medium-sized Australian exporters, including our wine producers. We, the Morrison government, have delivered trade agreements with China, Japan, and Korea, all growing wine markets. We've signed the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations, as well as agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong. As a result, Australia's exports increased to a record $438 billion in 2018, up from $307 billion in the financial year 2012-13. In 2018 Australia had a trade surplus of over $22 billion, compared to a deficit of $19.9 billion in financial year 2012-13.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our wine industry will also benefit from the new Trans-Pacific Partnership. It is an agreement between 11 major economies in our region with a total worth of over $13.7 trillion. Through these initiatives, we have opened up new opportunities for all of our exporters, including our wine exporters. We will continue to help them grow and prosper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this government hasn't just left support for small business at that. Other initiatives include reducing the tax rate for businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million from 30 per cent to 27.5 per cent, the lowest rate in 50 years. This will support some 230,000 small and medium-sized companies in my home state of Victoria alone. For unincorporated businesses with a turnover of less than $5 million, we have introduced a tax discount of eight per cent, capped at $1,000, and we have legislated a further increase to 16 per cent—a great boon for all small and medium-sized businesses. We have fast-tracked this tax relief so the full benefit is delivered in the financial year 2021-22. That is five years earlier than originally planned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is also helping small and medium businesses invest and grow through the instant asset write-off. We expanded the instant asset write-off for small and medium businesses up to a turnover of less than $50 million until 30 June this year. This means those businesses can instantly deduct each and every asset under $30,000. You can imagine that for a small to medium primary producer, like a wine producer, this means everything. This gives them the help that they need in real and meaningful ways. These changes will benefit 3.4 million businesses employing over seven million Australians, helping them to invest, create more jobs and develop further export opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Success, however, can be impacted by a range of issues. Factors such as drought, bushfires and plant disease can impact on crops and the quality of the product. Factors such as low wholesale prices, oversupply or export controls can impact growers' profitability. That is why the Morrison government has also announced a range of initiatives to help agricultural producers and small businesses through the impacts of drought and natural disasters. These include more than $1 billion of drought loans, worth individually up to $2 million, with no repayments or interest for the first two years. This will make it possible for some agricultural producers to buy fodder, transport stock, build water infrastructure, agist animals, mend fences or refinance existing debt. There is also a new small business drought loan of up to $500,000 that will help support small regional businesses impacted by the drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, wine producers have experienced various nefarious activities by people seeking to pass off inferior products through copycat wine and other grape product exports. The wine industry regulator has seen products exported from across the country with labels that seek to mimic elements of Australian brands for commercial gain and unfairly benefit from the reputation of those brands. They are damaging the hard work of reputable wine brands and threatening the continued growth of the wine industry not only in my home state but right across Australia. That is why the regulatory work of Wine Australia is so important. The continuing success of Australian wine exports depends on the maintenance of our internationally recognised reputation for quality and integrity, and that is supported by Wine Australia's regulatory activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian wine industry asked for stronger regulatory controls to deter the export of copycat wine from Australia. The passage of this bill will enable a label directory to be established as part of Wine Australia's export controls. The directory was proposed by industry as one way of assisting brand owners to protect their intellectual property rights and, by extension, the reputation of Australian wine. It will act as a deterrent to exporters of wine and other grape products who seek to damage Australia's wine industry and unfairly benefit from the reputation of Australian brands. The label directory will provide brand owners with a searchable database of images of labels that can be used to find labels that potentially infringe their intellectual property rights and enable them to undertake civil action against copycat exporters through the Australian legal system. The bill will also enable Wine Australia to use the label directory in administering licences to export wine under the Wine Australia Regulations 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great challenges of creating a regulatory regime is ensuring that it does not create an undue burden on those who seek to work within the regulations. This government has actively sought to reduce compliance costs for businesses, individuals and community groups and has removed over $6 billion of regulatory burden since coming to office in 2013. This includes simplified business activity statements for 2.7 million small businesses, doubling of ASIC financial reporting thresholds, reducing the burden on 2,200 companies, a small business superannuation clearing house and hundreds of other decisions that are making life easier for our small businesses, including our wine producers and exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To help reduce state government red tape, the government will pay up to $300 million to states and territories that reduce the regulatory burden on small business, assuming they deliver on the promises that they have made. As part of that effort I acknowledge my colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, former minister for agriculture, for her work on this policy piece. I also thank the Department of Agriculture, Wine Australia, IP Australia and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for their work on this bill that is now before us. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I'm really pleased to speak on the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019 because I'm a big supporter of the wine industry in Australia, especially in South Australia. I'm always going to be pleased to support legislation that will make the work of this important industry easier and, credit where credit's due, this bill does do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, this bill aims to amend the Wine Australia Act 2013, to enable Wine Australia to establish and maintain a publically available directory of grape product labels intended for export. The purpose of the label directory is to deter exports of copycat wine from Australia. This bill does not give Wine Australia the power to protect the intellectual property rights of wine brand owners. However, it will better facilitate wine brand owners to protect their own interests by being able to search the database, to easily see whether other labels may be seeking to trade off their intellectual property, so they can undertake appropriate civil action against copycat exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who is familiar or has a relationship with the wine industry would know that this is a significant issue for industry. The issue around copycats has certainly affected a lot of businesses in South Australia. So any work that seeks to address that is work that the Labor Party obviously would support, particularly for the industry in South Australia, where some of our best known brands globally and the most important wine exports for Australia are located. On that note, I draw attention to a fantastic winemaker in the chamber at the moment in Senator Farrell, who, I am sure, will be welcoming the provisions within the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill isn't enough or sufficient to do all we know that we need to do to be supporting our wine industry, because we're at a critical juncture for this industry. This is particularly true in my home state of South Australia. The wine industry in South Australia suffered enormously in the recent bushfires, especially in the Adelaide Hills. The Cudlee Creek fire that tore through the Hills region claimed 25,000 hectares. I visited Cudlee Creek a few week ago and was able to see the impact of this firsthand—in particular, at Petaluma Wine, in Woodside, in the Adelaide Hills. Petaluma was one of dozens of affected wineries in this region, and the impact of the fire is clear to see, not just within Petaluma's property but in the surrounding properties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I witnessed blackened soils from eerie patterns on the ground, showing the seemingly random path of the fire through the vines. I saw vines completely burnt, vines that had been spared and areas where the fire appeared to have jumped certain parts of the property and the vineyard. I saw vines shrivelled to ash and buildings gutted in its wake. Grand centuries-old gum trees adjacent to the cellar door are now blackened through sections of their trunks. Some of these will survive, with the scars a constant reminder, but others won't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Petaluma estimates significant losses to production for the year. Yet this winery was relatively fortunate if we compare it to other wineries in the Adelaide Hills. Their cellar door is still intact, which means they can welcome visitors, they can still showcase their wines and they can still be part of that critical tourism infrastructure that is so important to the Adelaide Hills, and they still have some vines for future production. Others have absolutely nothing left. Vinteloper was completely engulfed, losing all of their vines, their cellar door and even the owner's home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But across the Adelaide Hills, in true South Australian style, there is a widespread resolve to rebuild and regroup. It speaks volumes to the character of the wine industry that there is widespread determination to recover from this bushfire disaster. In listening to what some producers need, through recovery support, what I heard clearly was that the recovery is only just beginning and it will be a process that takes many, many years. The industry will require our significant and long-term support. All wineries are different, of course, and their recoveries will take different paths and they will have different needs. Some will need large distributors, like Coles and Woolworths, to be flexible with supply over the coming years, so that they can maintain important existing distribution agreements. Some will need weekend tourists to accept, for a while, some reduced amenity whilst they're visiting. What they will need is a continuing effort from consumers to buy local and to make a special effort to seek out local produce and local wines. What they need desperately is the support of our parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though there is a long and difficult process ahead, there are signs of positivity, there are signs that this recovery is already underway. Vines that shrivelled in the bushfire heat but stayed alive are now pushing out small green bunches of new grapes. On the backdrop of the black earth, vibrant green grass shoots provide a stunning reminder of nature's incredible capacity to renew and regrow. The winemakers are testing their fruit to assess the impact of the bushfire and the smoke aftermath on the quality of the fruit. The Australian Wine Research Institute will apply knowledge gained from previous bushfires to support producers through this disaster. I want to put on the record what producers have been telling me, which is that they have just absolute praise for the Australian Wine Research Institute and the work they have been doing to actively support them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parliament we should be working to ensure practical support is provided to the right areas to help producers return to business as usual as quickly as possible. Bills such as this is an important way to support the industry. But there are, of course, bigger issues that we as a nation must be tackling to be able to say with confidence that we are doing everything we can to support our wine industry, an industry that substantially provides for our broader economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia's five world-renowned wine regions in the Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley, Coonawarra and the Adelaide Hills, as well as the other regions in our state that are producing top quality wine, account for almost 80 per cent of Australia's premium wine production. So protecting local South Australian wine brands is vital not just for my state of South Australia but also for our national wine industry. In 2017-18, South Australia's wine industry generated more than $2 billion in revenue, with $1.8 billion from exports to more than 100 countries. Australian wine exports have continued to grow in the 12 months to June 2019, increasing by four per cent in value to almost $3 billion. In 2017-18, Australia consumed over 400 million litres of wine but exported more than 800 million litres—double the amount consumed locally. Clearly this is a critical industry for our broader economy. South Australia is charging and fuelling that industry and its growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So especially at this time, a time when our South Australian industry has been devastated by these unprecedented bushfires, we need to be doing everything we can to support our wine industry, to support our producers and to support the people in South Australia whose jobs are dependent on the success of these businesses, on the exports of these businesses. That is absolutely critical. We need to do more than just provide monetary support and short-term support schemes. We need a long-term plan and we need to listen to people in this industry who are concerned about the broader changes ahead for their industry. I'm speaking specifically here about the challenges that climate change will present to this industry and to producers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 January 2020, the grape and wine peak industry organisation, AGW, provided an update on the impacts the bushfires have had on various wine-producing regions. To date, the fires have impacted more than 60 grapegrowers and wine producers in the Adelaide Hills. The flow-on effect within the region is going to be severe, clearly, with this level of impact. The devastation has hit close to home for growers, producers and wineries in the region, with significant losses of vineyards, buildings, equipment, machinery and wine. Equipment is an important part of the story, but, of course, insurance often covers the cost of equipment and we can rebuild. The damage to the wines, the damage to the other part of the infrastructure, the damage to the natural environment, the damage to the precious things that were also burnt cannot be replaced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a challenging season of the extreme heat that we have seen, of drought, of catastrophic bushfires, it is so clear that this industry is hurting. It is hurting deeply. We have to be clear when we're talking about this, if we're going to be meaningful and impactful in the ways we want to support this industry, that we acknowledge that the severity of this bushfire season and the extreme weather that exacerbated conditions has resulted from our changing climate. There's no stepping away from that. The science is very clear. Australia's wine industry is on the front line of climate change. They have an incredible amount to lose if we do not take action on climate change seriously. Climate scientists warn that the increasing challenges to grape growing reflect the vulnerabilities of the entire farming industry. As Professor Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at the ANU, recently stated, climate change is already having an impact not just on the amount of product they can grow but also the quality of product. Our rapidly changing climate is having significant impacts on the agriculture sector more broadly, but of course particularly on our winemakers, who want the government to act meaningfully on climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australian wine growers have stated that the dramatic shift in harvest dates is just one of the things that are taking a toll on their businesses. In response to this they have invested significantly in irrigation, solar and other measures to combat these challenges. But it's not a fight our producers can win on their own. It's not a fight any industry which is at risk that climate change will fundamentally affect their bottom line, their business, can tackle on their own. We have had expert warnings, even a decade ago, just on the instance of these fires which have hit the industry, that these seasons would become longer and more intense, exacerbated by the forces of climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's own official emissions data last month confirmed that Australia will not meet our Kyoto commitment to cut emissions by five per cent. We are clearly not doing enough. Industry is clearly looking to government to show leadership in this. Industry sees what's happening with climate change. They see the risks to their industry; they see the risks to production; they see the changing nature of production that climate change will have. This is so true for the wine industry, where grapes are completely dependent on climatic conditions. A change in the climate has a significant and direct impact on the wine industry and on our growers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do support these measures. I think they're practical and good steps. But if the government are serious about supporting our industry into the long term, beyond these measures, in addressing the serious challenges that are in front of the wine industry with respect to climate change, they need to do more. They need to join groups, old friends of theirs—BCA, BP, BHP, Telstra—and come onboard with net zero emissions by 2050. They need to come forward with a target, and then they need to develop a meaningful plan which will take on climate change. This is something business needs. It's something our wine industry needs. Our wine industry cannot fight this fight on their own. They need government. We need to be setting a strategic direction. Our wine industry and the wine we produce are high-value products. They are known worldwide and their quality is known worldwide. We need to protect this industry. We need to protect those products and we need to do everything we can to ensure that they can focus on fighting the fights they need to do. They need to focus on building their business and growing their business, and we need to take leadership on climate change. We need to take leadership on one of the biggest threats to their business going forward into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as I have said throughout my speech, we also need to do so much more over the next few years to support this industry, especially in South Australia and especially in the Adelaide Hills, where the impact of the recent bushfires has been truly devastating. We need to support the industry there not just now, not just in the next few months, but in the years ahead, because for our wine industry that is when the impact is going to hit. That's the kind of lead time we're talking about in terms of the damage to their vines and their product getting out to market. We need to show them our support over the next few years. They need to see a plan from us for this. They need to see a plan long term on the critical issue of climate change, an issue which keeps them up at night in terms of how they're going to protect their businesses and products going forward. That is what they are looking for from us, so I am pleased to support this bill before us. I welcome it and I welcome the practical steps it's taking to support our wine industry, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture and the bigger discussion we need to be having in this chamber on how to support our wine industry post the bushfire and on how we can support our wine industry by tackling the issue of climate change.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the recent bushfires, the world watched as some of our best wine regions in the country were ravaged. They devastated some of our communities; however, it also brought out some of the best parts of our country and our communities, such as the spirit of mateship and a sense of community. The fires saw something in the order of 30 per cent, or around a third, of Adelaide Hills' production destroyed and more than 60 growers and producers in the Adelaide Hills impacted. The region lost something in the order of $20 million worth of wine, which in broad terms translates to approximately 794,000 cases. It will take years for these grapegrowers and winemakers to recover, and that's why it's important that we continue to support these local economies and communities upon which those businesses rely. However, it's pleasing to say that despite all of this adversity, South Australia is back open for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to help these winemakers and grapegrowers in every way possible. I'm a passionate advocate for supporting South Australian produce and, of course, Australian produce as well. The Morrison coalition government is backing business and continuing to assist our wine regions with this bill, which is designed to stop copycat wine producers from taking advantage. The bill will go some way to combating that very immediate and very present threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is, of course, a world leader in the production of premium agriculture products generally. We're renowned for producing premium-level food and wine in this country, which is highly sought after by consumers the world over. The Australian wine sector contributes something in the order of $40 billion annually to the Australian economy itself. There are 65 wine regions in Australia and approximately 2,500 wineries with around 6,000 grapegrowers making up those numbers. The Australian wine growing areas broadly stretch from southern Queensland to Tasmania and from the Margaret River in the west to my home state of South Australia, with, as I have just described, the Adelaide Hills and the wonderful McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley growing regions as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worldwide demand for Australian wine created a boom in vineyard plantings in the 1990s and that boom just continued. The short-term outlook, at least, for the wine sector is positive. However, there is competition from larger wine producing countries all over the globe, and that will continue to place pressure on domestic producers in this country. The success of Australian wine exports depends partly, at least, on the maintenance of our internationally-recognised reputation for quality and integrity, and that is supported by Wine Australia's regulatory activities. The good name of our wine brands is particularly important for showcasing the range of wines we have on offer and that secondary process of building trust with the consumer. It's true to say that although we often equate the issues of piracy and forgery with other industries, such as the movie industry and sometimes the pharmaceutical industry, unfortunately the incidence of counterfeit Australian wine being sold around the world is a very real issue and it is seemingly on the rise. In fact, the discovery of 14,000 bottles of fake Penfolds wine, a great South Australian winery, for sale in China in November 2018 highlighted the extent and the trajectory of that problem. These items, apparently, were discovered online at severely reduced prices, and that seemingly triggered the awakening to this issue, partly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the existence of the counterfeit trade reduces confidence in the genuine Australian article, and that confidence translates into the industry itself. The industry has approached government and asked for stronger regulatory controls to attempt to deter the export of copycat wine from Australia. Those copycat wines, of course, are products which are exported from this country with labels that seek to mimic elements of the brands that they represent for their commercial gain. Therefore, they unfairly benefit from the reputation of those brands and the good reputation of the Australian wine producers who produce them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So a label directory was proposed by the industry as a useful way to assist brand owners to protect their intellectual property rights and, by extension, the reputation of the wine itself. The bill will establish a label directory as part of Wine Australia's export controls as a deterrent to exporters of wine and other grape products who seek to unfairly benefit from the reputation of Australian brands. It will provide brand owners with the use of a searchable database of images of labels that can be used to find labels potentially infringing on the intellectual property rights of the grapegrowers and the wineries who rely upon them. It will also enable them to undertake civil action against copycat exporters through the Australian legal system. The amendments to this act will enable Wine Australia to impose additional requirements on wine exporters as a condition of approval to export grape products from Australia, and the requirements will be part of Wine Australia's grape product registration process. Failure to comply with that process will mean that grape products, including wine, can't be exported, but there will be no impacts for importers of wine into Australia, who are not in that orbit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the framing of the recent bushfires and the issues affecting some of the wineries in this country, this bill is another important step and is of tremendous importance to the integrity of, and continuing confidence in, the wine industry in this country, including in my home state. It adds one more string to Wine Australia's export bow, if you like, representing yet another mechanism which the industry can use to properly control the trade of counterfeit and copycat wines. As a senator for South Australia, the home of the finest wines in the country, I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

My home state is the very proud producer of just over 17 per cent of Australia's total output of wines. No state has more individual wine regions, wineries and diversity of wine varieties than Victoria. Without trying to claim the best wines in the country—although I would hate not to make the point that I do believe that Victoria does offer the best wines in Australia, but my colleagues on my side and those opposite will probably beg to differ—I say it is just really good to see the number of varieties that Australia, since Federation, has been able to produce. We have some of the best wines in the world, and the viticulture industry is certainly one that we should be very proud of. It employs quite a number of people across our nation.

                    </a>  Senator Hanson-Young, I say that not just to brag about it but to point out how serious the wine industry is to those I represent—and no doubt to those you represent as well. We are talking about an $8 billion industry which employs around 13,000 in my state of Victoria. Those 13,000 workers work hard every day to ensure that the product is of the highest possible standard in order to allow them to compete in the $460 billion global market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we in this place may not be of much help in the vineyard—with the obvious exception of Senator Farrell, who is obviously from South Australia, Senator Hanson-Young; he knows a few things about turning grapes into something special and of great value—there are some things that we can do to help. One thing we can do to help our wine producers is to protect the integrity of their brands. That is the purpose of the bill that we are debating today. It will enable Wine Australia to establish and maintain a publicly accessible directory of all Australian wine labels that are subject to export. This is a rather straightforward proposal. The directory will feature digital images of wine labels and information about the wine and the producer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate that these measures have become necessary. Owing to the high quality and high value of Australian wines, we've seen in recent years a growing number of counterfeit Australian wines. A number of my colleagues in this place have obviously touched on that point. I will give one example. In November 2017 it was reported that Chinese authorities had seized around 14,000 bottles of wine purporting to be Penfolds. These bottles are very popular amongst many of my colleagues. The wines that were found by Chinese authorities were cheap, readily accessible and looked just like the real thing. Whilst there may have been wine in those bottles, or at least a red liquid of some description, not a drop of it actually came from Penfolds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to elaborate at length on the risks that exist to Australian wine brands in a market like China, which itself accounts for almost $1 billion of our export wine value, but when the standards to ensure integrity aren't stringent it does have an impact on the industry as a whole. As we can all imagine, if you had bought one of the bottles of Penfolds that I mentioned earlier, thinking it was the genuine thing, and naturally found the product to be lacking in body and character, you'd be unlikely to buy a second one. With this new directory, wine producers who seek to copy the branding of well-known Australian brands for their own commercial gain will be more easily identified and sanctioned by the regulator. This could also involve the suspension or cancellation of their licences to export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are yet more things we can do to support our nation's wine producers. As has been foreshadowed, Labor will be moving a second reading amendment to this bill to highlight the importance of taking meaningful action to combat climate change and secure the sustainability of Australian viticulture. We know that our climate is changing and we hear from all those involved in agriculture about the impact that this is having on their produce. The recent fires across eastern Australia and in my home state of Victoria have had a profound effect on wine-producing regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor certainly welcome the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019 and the creation of this new directory. We welcome the opportunity to assist our nation's wine producers to safeguard the integrity of the product. It is great this afternoon to see us talking about the significance of the wine industry in Australia, the importance that it has to our economy and the number of job opportunities that it provides for many regions across Australia as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by thanking everyone who's made a contribution, and I also want to make the point that it certainly is important that senators in this place stand up for an industry that employs quite a number of people and that has a value outside of Australia, globally. It is something that we should all be very proud of. People do identify with a number of Australian wines, especially those from many parts of our regions, and I'm very pleased that Victoria offers some of the best wines in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise to speak on the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019 and to follow on from other contributors. The Australian wine industry is one of our nation's great success stories. It's been built by pioneer families who recognised very early on that Australia's climate and terroir were building blocks for wine production of high quality. In my home state of Victoria, these pioneers include the Browns of Milawa, the Campbells and Morris families of Rutherglen and, more recently, Otto and Elena Dal Zotto in the King Valley, who make a fabulous Prosecco—and I hope we'll still be able to call it that post EU free trade agreement negotiations. These pioneering families have developed the industry and their household names and brands over many generations. This bill comes to the Senate designed to protect their blood, sweat and tears from unscrupulous operators who seek to cash in on their hard work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world and the fifth-largest wine exporter, with two-thirds of Australian wine exported, adding $2.89 billion to the economy annually. The continuing successes of Australian wine exports depend on the maintenance of our internationally recognised reputation for quality and integrity, which is supported by Wine Australia's regulatory activities. The Australian wine industry, represented by Australian Grape and Wine Incorporated, asked the government for stronger regulatory controls to deter the export of copycat wine from Australia. Copycat wine and other grape-product exports are products that are exported from Australia with labels that seek to mimic elements of Australian brands for commercial gain and to unfairly benefit from the reputation of those brands. A label directory was proposed by industry as a useful way to assist brand owners to protect their intellectual property rights and, by extension, the reputation of Australian wine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passage of the bill before the Senate today will enable a label directory to be established, as part of Australia's export controls, as a deterrent to exporters of wine and other grape products who seek to unfairly benefit from the reputation of Australian brands. The label directory will provide brand owners with a searchable database of images of labels, allowing them to find labels that potentially infringe their intellectual property rights and enabling them to undertake civil action against copycat exporters through the Australian legal system. The bill will also enable Wine Australia to use the label directory in administering licences to export wine under the Wine Australia Regulations 2018. For instance, Wine Australia can use the images of the labels submitted to it to confirm that wine exporters are complying their obligations under the Label Integrity Program, as set out in the act, or evidence of copycat labelling can be used in Wine Australia's ongoing assessment of whether a wine exporter can be considered a fit and proper person to hold a licence to export wine from Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public consultation on the proposal to develop the label directory was undertaken by the department of agriculture during September and October 2018, and the majority of submissions from the wine industry broadly supported the need and proposed model for the label directory. Following this consultation, the department further refined the proposal with Wine Australia and AGW. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and IP Australia were also consulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Wine Australia Act 2013 made by this bill will enable Wine Australia to impose additional requirements on exporters as a condition of approval to export grape products from Australia. This will support our internationally recognised wine industry to not just maintain the beautiful, high-quality product, which is on tables and in restaurants not just in Australia but around the world, but to underpin the significant regional tourism and job opportunities that are a result of our valuable viticulture industry. The bill will allow regulations to be made that would result in a requirement that digital colour images of labels be submitted and administered. There will be no impacts on importers of wine to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the bill before us has the full support of the Australian Senate. It will underpin the integrity of our system of wine exports, and I think that's something everyone in this chamber can support.</span>

Hannah Clarke and her children—Aaliyah, six; Laianah, four; and Trey, three—were murdered on a street in Brisbane. They died at the hands of an evil man, a man they should not have had to fear: Hannah's estranged husband and the father of those beautiful children. We ask as a nation: how could anyone do such a thing to the ones he should love? And we ask: why could Hannah and her children not be protected?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These questions and more will have to be dealt with at an inquest in Queensland, which will seek to reveal the truth behind this horrific crime. For now our nation wraps its arms around the family of Hannah Clarke. We say to the Clarke family today that we are with you in your grief. Tears have been shed all over our nation for Hannah and her children. All Australians have felt the pain of this horrific crime and support you. We convey to you our love and the sympathies of everyone here in this place, reflecting the love and sympathy from all the Australian people. We hope you can take some comfort in the fact that as a community and as a nation we embrace you at this incredibly difficult time. You as a family must have so many emotions. You must be asking yourselves so many questions. And if you are angry and feel let down by the system you have every right to feel that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments and authorities across this country have done so much to try to protect the victims of domestic violence, but Hannah and her children were not protected when they should have been. Right across governments, law enforcement agencies and the judiciary, we must ask ourselves: how can we do better? We must not let Hannah's and her children's deaths be in vain. We must learn from this and move to protect other women and children who find themselves in similar situations. The figures are too terrible to ignore: one woman is killed every nine days by a partner or a former partner, one in six Australian women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner since the age of 15, and every two minutes somewhere in our country police are called out to a domestic violence incident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth and the states have worked closely together on trying to tackle this violence. This has very much been a bipartisan initiative, and we acknowledge the work to establish the first action plan under the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children 2010-2022 commenced under the Rudd and Gillard governments. Now, as part of the fourth action plan, the Commonwealth is investing $340 million for frontline services to protect and support women and children. In total, since 2013, the Commonwealth has committed $840 million to address domestic and family violence—and yet we face this. In August last year, COAG agreed to the fourth action plan. In November we released the national implementation plan. It includes funding for prevention strategies and frontline services, including for groups which need additional support, funding for safe spaces as well as funding for 1800RESPECT. 1800RESPECT is open 24 hours to support people impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence and abuse.</span>

Like many, I couldn't read the reports when they first came in, because they were too distressing. Like many, I think we held our children closer. The reports, the news—what happened was devastatingly awful. It was tragic, incomprehensible. We ask ourselves: why does this keep happening? But it does. As Senator Cormann said, a woman a week in this country is murdered by a current or former partner. One in three are experiencing physical violence from the time they're 15. One in five are experiencing sexual violence.</span>

We join with people across the nation in expressing our grief and sorrow and our support for the family, and we extend this to many other victims and survivors of family violence in Australia. But actually it shouldn't be a shock to us that this has happened to yet another woman and her family. We shouldn't be shocked there's been another murder. In the early hours of Saturday morning a woman in Townsville was stabbed to death in her home. Again, a case of family violence. We can't continue to simply be shocked. We ought to resolve to act. We ought to resolve to end the national emergency of family violence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let this event, this tragic, senseless murder of a woman and her children, be a catalyst for change—changes in approach from governments but also changes in attitudes in our communities. As Our Watch said in response to the Camp Hill tragedy, 'No one individual, community, organisation or government alone can prevent violence against women.' They said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In order to prevent violence against women, we need a shared, consistent and mutually reinforcing approach, where all levels of government, business and the community contribute to creating a safer Australia built upon respect and equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The right of women and children to live safely in their homes, in their communities, without fear mustn't be compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, all of us, individually and collectively, have a responsibility to lead and to work together to provide support to women escaping violent and abusive relationships. I support Anthony Albanese's call for a national summit because we need to come together to listen to survivors and experts. We need to listen and to act and we all have a role to play. On this day, why don't we commit to doing more than being shocked? Why don't we commit to really working together for change? We mourn, but let's do more than mourn. Let us all act together to eliminate violence against women. This is what the memory of this family and so many others deserves.</span>

This act of violence, this murder, has not just shaken my home town of Brisbane; it has shaken the nation. The violent killing of women and children by the people that are supposed to love them is inexcusable. Hannah did everything that she was supposed to do. She left. She filed for a domestic violence order against her ex-partner. She sought help. But this was not enough. The system didn't protect her and her family. They were killed while awaiting a hearing for that breach of a domestic violence order.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will always remember Hannah, along with the eight other women who have been murdered this year, the 61 women who were murdered last year, and all of the other women who have lost their lives in the past. Too many lives have been ended because our government has not done enough to end the systemic and cultural factors that lead some men to believe that they are entitled to control their partner and their children. I and my colleagues pledge to do everything we can to ensure that domestic violence prevention, support and crisis services are properly funded and resourced, so that we can finally see an end to this national security crisis. And I hope that the victim blaming that we've seen from some of the media outlets and, sadly, from the mouths of some people in this chamber will cease.</span>

The tragedy visited on that young family in Queensland last week has, I think, shocked us all to the very core. Three beautiful children and their mother were horrifically killed by the man whose job it was to protect them, to provide for them, to love them, and to see them grow and develop over time. It was horrific and shocking. Families are an institution that exist to nurture children, to provide a deep, loving, stable environment for their growth and development, and for deep, loving relationships between two adults to extend for a lifetime. They're not places for fear, for disrespect or for violence to be visited on innocent women and children at any time. Domestic violence has no place in Australia. That is why our government has taken strong steps, in partnership with state governments, to address this, but we must do better. We must do better for the future children, sons and daughters, of Australia. Our deepest sympathies to the families and friends. We are looking forward to working with everyone in this chamber to end this scourge.</span>

It was a calculated, callous, cowardly and evil act that has left so many Australians incapable of comprehension. His disgusting action has further added fuel to an already twisted and difficult family law debate that has seen many decent men deprived of their parental rights. Like so many Australians, I am so angry at the selfish motivation he has shown. Please do not let this bastard's actions reflect on all men.</span>

I and my Centre Alliance colleagues give heartfelt condolences to the Clarke family. Lloyd, Suzanne and Nat have lost a remarkable daughter and sister and their precious grandchildren, nieces and nephew. The unspeakable murder of Hannah Clarke and her young children has left the nation reeling. We're all in shock over what has happened. Hannah Clarke did nothing wrong—not a thing. She dreamt of starting a new life after making the courageous decision to leave a violent and abusive man who sought to control and dominate all aspects of her life. She had every right to be free. Hannah has been described by her brother, Nat, as trying her best to bring joy to all those around her and only ever wanting the very best for her children. Photos of Hannah and her children laughing and playing actually break my heart. Their freedom was short-lived. There is absolutely no justification for these senseless murders—none. It was a senseless act by a monster.</span>

I can inform the Senate that Minister Payne, the Minister for Women, is convening a meeting of all the women's safety ministers next week. This will be a very important meeting, accelerating the work already underway. Then, in the following week, the Council of Australian Governments will be updated on the work that has been undertaken as part of the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. This is all work we do in partnership, of course, and alongside the state and territory governments, who are on the front line in relation to this issue. This has, of course, been a bipartisan initiative all the way through. I again acknowledge that this work—to establish the first action plan—commenced under the Rudd and Gillard governments.</span>

We will continue, as we have done, to work in a non-partisan fashion with all of the state and territory governments in relation to these issues to ensure that appropriate funding is provided. Indeed, in my statement a little earlier, I did point out the very significant funding that has been put in place during our period in government to address this terrible issue. The government's first priority is to keep Australians safe. Combating violence against women and children is, of course, central to that objective. Women have the right to be safe in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces and online. Since 2013, the Commonwealth has committed $840 million to address domestic and family violence and will continue, as I say, to work with all of the state and territory governments to further build on the work that's already been done.</span>

We heard, in the remarks of leaders in the chamber prior to question time, that this is a very difficult matter to speak of, given the events of last week. We all learned of the tragedy at Camp Hill with horror and great sadness. I know that colleagues across the government and across the parliament are also grappling with this appalling event and trying to understand how something like this can happen. And it is important that we do continue to reflect on it and to talk about it and that we do act on it. Our government believes that one death of a woman or a child at the hands of a partner or a father is one too many. Our unequivocal goal is to reduce family violence and to eliminate it. It is, as colleagues have said, unacceptable that a woman is killed every week in Australia by a partner.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Language is important. We can't tolerate public language that trivialises or distorts the reality of domestic violence. Each murder, each act of domestic violence, is an individual atrocity. There is no betrayal so detestable as an act of violence against the people we are supposed to love and care for. Hannah Clarke and her three children, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey, had a right to be safe in their home, within their neighbourhood. All women and children in Australia have that right. As a community, as a parliament, we must redouble our efforts to keep women and children safe.</span>

As Minister Cormann indicated, as part of the fourth action plan the Commonwealth government is investing considerably—$340 million—in frontline services to protect and support women and children. That includes funding for training 18,500 frontline workers, providing safe places for women and children affected by violence and support for the 1800RESPECT line.</span>

But we also know that to bring about the further change needed we need collaboration and commitment from governments, from the community and from individuals. I spoke this morning with my state colleague Di Farmer in Queensland, the Minister for Child Safety, Youth and Women and Minister for Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence, about our work together. In the wake of Camp Hill we'll consider what additional approaches we need to take, including access to mental health services to support both victims and people who are at risk of perpetrating violence. I will work on that with my counterpart women's safety ministers.</span>

I'm very proud that the Morrison government is firmly committed to Australia's national security, keeping Australians safe and also creating more jobs for Australian workers. That's why the Morrison government is building the future submarines right here in Australia, with Australian workers and with Australian steel. On this side of the chamber we understand that our future submarines are an essential capability for Australian defence and, unlike those opposite, we are acquiring this new capability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I met with the French defence minister, Florence Parly, and we discussed the ongoing implementation of the Future Submarine program, which is currently in the preliminary design phase. This was a productive meeting, with both Australia and France reaffirming our full commitment to the program but also acknowledging the key role it plays in understanding and underpinning our growing strategic partnership. Minister Parly was absolutely crystal clear in her commitment and support for an ambitious target to maximise Australian industry capability and for meeting project milestones. We will personally meet quarterly to monitor costs and schedules this year to ensure that the next milestone, due in January 2021, is met.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delivery of the Future Submarine program is hugely ambitious and complex. This is why we have been tough in our negotiations in finalising the strategic partnering agreement and we have implemented a robust fit-for-purpose risk management framework to get this critical capability right.</span>

The contrast between the coalition and Labor's record on naval shipbuilding could not be starker. Defence was an unacceptable casualty of Labor's appalling economic and budget management. Defence spending fell to 1.56 per cent of GDP in the 2012-13 budget, the lowest level of defence expenditure since 1938, with $18 billion ripped out of defence. Labor delayed the program to replace Navy's Collins class submarines, risking a capability gap. In six years, Labor did not commission a single Australian built naval vessel. The shipbuilding valley of death was Labor's own valley of death. Those opposite harp on about local content, but let me remind you that 100 per cent of zero, which is your record, is still zero. By contrast— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Frontline domestic violence crisis services have said for years that women and children are being turned away from essential services due to lack of funding: the beds are full; the crisis phone lines can't all be answered when they ring; and women are being forced to choose between violence and homelessness. This government's DV funding is not enough. It's not protecting sufferers from family violence. How many more women and children need to be killed before this government will treat this as domestic terrorism and as the real national security crisis and put the $5 billion over 10 years that's needed for frontline services and primary prevention?</span>

As the finance minister said in his statement before question time, the Commonwealth has, in the fourth action plan, made the largest contribution to addressing violence against women and their children, with a $340 million contribution. It covers a range of factors. It covers improving and building on frontline services. It covers prevention strategies to help eradicate domestic and family violence in our homes, our workplaces, our communities and our clubs. It covers support and prevention measures for ATSI communities, funded under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. There is funding to provide safe places for people impacted by domestic and family violence, funding for 1800RESPECT, funding for dedicated men's support workers in family advocacy and support services locations, and funding to better support former partners of veterans who are impacted by domestic violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other measures that will contribute to improved safety for women and girls. There is funding of $1.2 billion over three years from the Commonwealth for legal assistance services, including delivering that through a new single mechanism that allows for a more collaborative, innovative and effective legal assistance sector to address the legal needs of the most vulnerable. There is $10 million for practical, on-the-ground improvements to online safety for Australian children and their families.</span>

The number of women killed by violence is a statistic that also should be published widely to draw attention to this national crisis and help deter it. Destroy the Joint, a volunteer-run project, publishes it. Why hasn't the government established a close-to-real-time, national, government-run toll to track the national crisis? If a small organisation can make credible data available within days, why is the government so slow to act?</span>

Our commitment as a government is to preventing, addressing and, ultimately, ending this violence. What the Australian Institute of Criminology has been doing for over 25 years is reporting through its National Homicide Monitoring Program. It's data which is credibly sourced through our law enforcement, our National Coronial Information System and other data sources. As appropriate, it provides trend data upon which the government can design policy to prevent these homicides in the future. I understand the matters that Senator Waters raised but don't necessarily agree with them. The most important thing, from my perspective and from this government's perspective, is to eliminate violence against women and their families.</span>

We have to speak, write and report more accurately and empathetically about domestic violence. It's a matter that Senator Ruston and I raised in our statement last week. We have to think more carefully about our expectations of healthy, respectful relationships. As I said in answer to Senator Askew's question earlier in question time, language does matter.

The government's position is that we will continue to make decisions that are environmentally effective and economically responsible. What we will not do is take the reckless approach of the Labor Party, which the Australian people rejected at the last election, and that is to make meaningless promises without a plan, without a costing, without any information to the Australian people on what the impacts on the economy, on jobs, on living standards and, indeed, on global emissions are going to be, because the Australian people actually understand this very well. Imposing burdens in Australia on Australian business will just lead to shifting emissions to other parts of the world where emissions will be higher for the same level of economic output. It is not helping to address climate change. It is imposing a sacrifice here in Australia but not actually helping the environment. I would have thought that out of all people Senator Kitching would have known about this given that she's a senior member of the Otis group.</span>

Here we have Mr Albanese, as 'Shorten 2.0', working with Mark Butler, who for some reason escaped the blame for this terrible policy disaster at the last election where poor old Mr Bowen was moved on from the shadow Treasurer's position.</span>

Let me tell you this: in Australia we are a net exporter of energy. We are net exporters of energy sources. You know what? Our energy supplies like LNG, black coal and others can help reduce emissions by more. If we are not careful, in terms of the decisions that we make here, and if we don't properly calibrate the decisions when it comes to emissions in Australia, we could be doing harm to the global environment. That is why, unlike the Labor Party, unlike Mr Albanese and Mr Butler, who are pursuing an extremist, reckless and irresponsible approach when it comes to these issues, we will continue to make reasonable, responsible decisions focused on being environmentally effective and economically responsible.</span>

Minister, it's reported that 78,442 people are infected with the coronavirus, of which 2,456 have died. Based on those figures, the mortality rate appears to be a little over 3.1 per cent. In comparison to the Spanish flu, where the World Health Organization believed two to three per cent of those infected died, the coronavirus appears to be a deadlier pandemic. While I commend the Morrison government on closing the borders to Chinese travellers for the past few weeks, I'm at pains to understand why Australian universities are able to put profits before the health and security of this nation. Will the minister guarantee the health of Australians and put an end to universities circumventing our nation's flu-stopping Chinese travel ban?</span>

Senator Hanson, I am going to have to reject the premise of your question. The government's advice is very, very clear: students who have been outside mainland China for the last 14 days may be able to enter Australia provided that they do not return to China on the way to Australia. The government is not actively suggesting that students travel to a third country for 14 days, because of the changing epidemiology of this disease. The rapidly evolving situation, combined with changes to travel restrictions by other countries, could mean students could get stuck in a third country. Our advice to international students is that they should monitor the advice on the websites of the Department of Health and the Department of Home Affairs. Students should also check with their airline and education providers before making decisions to travel to Australia, including via a third country. They should also check any current travel restrictions for other countries before travelling. </span>

As the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister have stated, Australia is ready and our government is working constantly to keep Australians safe. Australia, as you have acknowledged, was one of the first countries in the world to declare coronavirus as a disease of pandemic potential, on 21 January, and this was more than a week before the World Health Organization. In terms of the decisions that the Australian government takes, as I have reiterated to the Senate, these decisions are underpinned by medical advice—</span>

The decisions that the Australian government have taken are underpinned, as I have stated to the Senate on a number of occasions, by medical advice and recommendations from the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and chief medical officers from each state and territory on the steps necessary to contain the spread of the coronavirus. In terms of the advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that our arrangements to protect Australians from coronavirus are working. There are no confirmed cases among Australian citizens and residents who have returned to Australia since the introduction of the border measures on 1 February 2020.</span>

Senator McGrath and I had the opportunity last Thursday to attend a jobs fair in Caboolture when the labour force figures actually came out. It has been acknowledged that it was a difficult January. Despite this and against market expectations, we saw in January 2020 the creation of over 46,000 full-time jobs. That was against market expectations. We saw a net increase of 13½ thousand jobs. This means that over the year to January 2020 we have seen employment increase by almost a quarter of a million jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a record number of Australians in employment. Just under 13 million Australians are now in work. That is a record high. We also have a record number of Australians in full-time work. Additionally, we continue to see a record number of women in employment. We have record female participation, and I am pleased to say that two-thirds of all new jobs for women are full-time jobs. Again in January we saw an increase in the participation rate. What does that mean? It means that Australians are putting up their hands and they are saying that they have confidence in the jobs market and they are ready, willing and able to work.</span>

The government takes jobs fairs around Australia, and almost 29,000 jobseekers have attended to date. Last Thursday, over 2,000 people came through the door. They were people who were actively searching for work locally in Caboolture, but there were also people who were coming there to talk to job service providers about the services that are available to them—for example, how to update your resume or how to sit down and undertake an interview. We had over 700 specific jobs on offer, with over 40 exhibitors talking to potential employees. This is all about ensuring that people who are actively looking for work are connected with the pathways to employers locally who are looking for employees.</span>

What governments do is put in place policies that enable, in this case, businesses to prosper, to grow and to create more jobs for Australians. And, as I've said, since we were elected to office in 2013, we've put in place policies that have now enabled the economy and hardworking employers out there to create in excess of 1.5 million jobs. How are we doing this? In the first instance, we are lowering taxes, whether it be lowering taxes for small businesses so they can reinvest back into their business, grow their business and create more jobs for Australians, or, alternatively, lowering taxes for working Australians, because we believe that Australians should be able to keep more of what they earn. We're also reducing the costs of doing business through deregulation, we're enabling better access to finance, we're ensuring that small businesses are paid on time, and we're building the infrastructure our economy needs to grow.</span>

We are absolutely committed to making sure that our social security system is accurate, fair and simple for the people who need it. As part of this commitment, the government is introducing legislation that will be making it simpler for welfare recipients who report their income to do so and will improve the accuracy of the payment system.</span>

Those 1.2 million people are required to report that to the Department of Social Services every fortnight.

                  </a>  This can be particularly difficult for people who might work shift work or do casual work. This can often lead to misreporting, both underestimating and overestimating, what people earn. What this legislation proposes is that instead of people having to go through that complex calculation, we're seeking to have them report what they earned, what they actually received, what they were paid, and not to have them make a calculation to estimate what they have earned. What we are doing here is ensuring that reporting of income is actually as it currently occurs and welfare recipients will report income as it is paid, as opposed to when it is earned. Changing the way employment income is reported simplifies this process for recipients. What we are doing is taking the guesswork out of the process.</span>

Most particularly, in addition to the change in the assessment model, for which the legislation is due to come before this place this week, it will also assist with the application and integration with the Single Touch Payroll data system, which means that welfare recipients can now have their employment and income details pre-filed, similar to what occurs on your tax returns. Through the advances that we have seen through the ATO, this will allow the information that employers report, as part of the system every fortnight, to populate Centrelink forms, which can be used as a prompt for recipients when they are filing their fortnightly returns. The recipient will still be required to validate their form. So, they are still able to make changes, if they believe the information contained in the pre-populated form may be inaccurate. It will assist in ensuring that we are not seeing underestimating or overestimating.</span>

They can do it online, on a mobile app, over the phone, or by visiting a Centrelink centre. But the way they report their income, as it is paid, as opposed to as it is earned, will be simpler and easier. In any given fortnight 550,000 Australians will report that they have some form of income. By simplifying the system, it will make a huge difference to these hundreds of thousands of people. It means that payment recipients also have greater certainty about what they are going to get each and every fortnight. If we can help people to ensure that they get paid the correct amount each fortnight, we reduce the likelihood of their receiving an overpayment. This is particularly important for ensuring the sustainability of our welfare system into the future and for giving confidence to the recipients.</span>

                  </a>  They are not competitive grants. There is a fundamental difference between what those on the opposition side of the chamber keep yelling out and what they actually are. You may not like it, but these were commitments that we took to the election—just like you took commitments to the election: Labor's election commitments. I believe that every single election commitment that Labor made that we're aware of was in Labor or target seats. The fact of the matter is you still cannot get over the fact that the Australian people endorsed the plan of action that we took to the election. They endorsed the plan of action that does see funding go to Labor seats. They endorsed the plan of action that takes into account a number of factors.</span>

                  </a>  I completely reject Senator Carr's characterisation of the funding of these projects. We took this plan to the Australian people. The Australian people looked at our plan and said, 'We trust the coalition government to implement an urban congestion fund that is actually going to make a difference where it counts.' What they said to Labor, in relation to Labor's election commitments, is 'We don't trust you in relation to the commitments you have made', including Thompsons Road Extension—$65 million in La Trobe, Senator Carr, a seat that you were targeting—and in Queensland the Rochdale Road/Priestdale Road upgrade, for $14 million in the electorate of Bonner. The fact of the matter is that this was a plan endorsed by the Australian people that is vital to busting congestion in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As at 6.30 am today, 24 February, there have been a total of 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia; 10 are reported to have recovered, with the remaining cases understood to be in a stable condition. The case totals by jurisdiction are two in South Australia, five in Queensland, four in Victoria, four in New South Wales and seven associated with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Diamond Princess</span> repatriation flight from Japan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Hunt and his state and territory counterparts attended the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee meeting on 23 February and were given an update on the current COVID-19 situation and discussed national preparedness of the health system. The advice received is that COVID-19—or coronavirus, as it is known—has been contained in Australia, with no new cases in the general population in the last week. Although the virus is contained in Australia, with only 22 cases, Australia is ready and has acted very early to prepare for a potential pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The containment of the virus in Australia is an encouraging indication that the government's approach to preventing the spread of coronavirus on our shores continues to be successful. Of the Australians who were on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Diamond Princess</span> and have been brought to the quarantine facility in Howard Springs, seven have been diagnosed with coronavirus. All are well and in a stable condition but have been put into an isolation and containment process before being medevaced to hospitals in their home states. The protection and safety of Australians remains the government's highest priority.</span>

As a consequence of the positive signs of containment, the committee has recommended that Border Force extend case-by-case exemptions to the travel bans to year 11 and 12 secondary students from mainland China, excluding Hubei. The government have considered and accepted that advice. There will now be a limited number of exemptions granted. These exemptions will be provided on a double green light basis. This means where both the Commonwealth and the relevant state and territory health authorities agree, students from mainland China have a pathway to return to Australia and continue their studies. We will continue to consider developments in China and advice from the committee as they meet and review health and travel arrangements on an ongoing basis.</span>

This means that for a further week foreign nationals, excluding permanent residents, who have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. The extension of exemptions to year 11 and 12 students will not substantially change these arrangements. Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members. We continue to require Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families who have been in mainland China from 1 February 2020 and who returned to Australia to self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. Again, our No. 1 priority as a government is protecting Australia and Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Families and Social Services (Senator Ruston) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators McAllister and Kitching today relating to carbon emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to do better. This parliament has been locked in the same battle for 10 long, wasted years. Actions have consequences, but so too does failure to act. Neglect has consequences, and we can see that already. We have seen it this summer. We see it in so many reports about what is happening around our world. We know that the consequences of climate change will only get more serious. To keep the planet safe, we have to achieve less than two degrees of global warming and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees, and to do that the world must achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a radical proposition; it's a proposition supported by the Business Council, AGL, Santos, BHP, Amcor, BP, Wesfarmers, Telstra and many others. It is a proposition which has been adopted by 73 other countries, many with conservative governments. Australia must pull our weight. We have to get to zero emissions ourselves. The reason is we have so much to lose and so much to gain. As Ross Garnaut says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has the strongest interest among developed countries in the success of a global effort on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put a dollar figure on it. Melbourne university has told us that the cost to Australia of not getting to zero net emissions is $2.7 trillion. That is 20 times the cost of acting. Professor Garnaut has also said we have the most to gain economically from being part of a global transition to a zero-emissions economy. CSIRO said last year that reducing emissions to net zero by 2050 will deliver stronger economic growth, higher wages, lower energy bills—that's not from the Labor Party but from CSIRO. Instead of dealing with the facts and instead of a responsible debate based on facts, for the last decade we have had a fear campaign based on falsehood. I have watched in this chamber as Barnaby Joyce many years ago, whilst he was in this chamber, helped destroy the bipartisan consensus with the coalition and helped move the Liberal Party from a sensible, moderate position to a position determined by those on the hard Right, and we have had a decade of inaction as a consequence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The political class, the media and the business community—those with the direct capacity to influence and determine our country's response to this profound crisis—should I think take a leaf from the Australian people themselves, because the determination and the cooperation shown by Australians when dealing with the bushfires is the determination and cooperation that we should be showing in this place to address the drivers of bushfires. We have to change our political culture. We must end the climate wars. We need to stop the nonsense that action on climate is radical. It is not. We cannot indulge the fiction that the many who want action are outliers. We are not. The outliers are those who don't accept that we need to get to zero net emissions by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we once had consensus across the parties of government on climate action in this country before some decided they could make political gain by creating fear. We see the same battleground again, the same gotcha questions and the same tired debate. I think that so many of these gotcha questions are about distorting the debate in favour of doing nothing, and they are part of the political problem, because they polarise the community and cruel the chances of building enough consensus to act. How about we look at the cost of not acting in terms of the cost to our economy, the cost to our way of life and the cost of lost opportunity?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of us needs to ask ourselves whether we're helping or harming in this debate. There are many people inside the Liberal Party and in the community who recognise that this is not a radical position, who recognise that this is something we need to deal with responsibly and who recognise that this is something we should deal with on the basis of evidence and facts and make rational policy decisions about. I say to those opposite: there's a reason Tony Abbott is no longer in the parliament. It's because people who voted for you understood that ultimately his and the position that many of you hold is irrational.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  There is one thing which the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate said in her contribution in this debate which I agree with, and that is that the argument should be based on evidence and the facts. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate refers to the 'gotcha question'. What is the gotcha question? The question is: what will your policy cost? That's the gotcha question. It's not an unreasonable question. That's the question you could not answer for people in my home state of Queensland. That is the question you could not answer for workers at the Boyne Island smelter. That is the question you couldn't answer for people working in the beef industry in western Queensland. That is your gotcha question, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. How much will it cost? How will you achieve it? What does it mean for the voters of Queensland? What will it do to electricity prices? These are your gotcha questions. You still can't answer them. All you have done is kick the can 20 years down the road, from 2030 to 2050, when none of us will be in this place, when no-one here will be accountable for the decisions and policy direction you have taken. You call these gotcha questions. These aren't gotcha questions; these are questions which working families in Queensland have a right to have answers to. They have a right to know what it means for their communities, what it means for their jobs and what it means for the people of Queensland. They have a right to answers to those questions.</span>

                  </a>  You may well know it, but I query whether or not you remember it, because you've just rolled out exactly the same policy but even worse, without a road map. You talk about evidence and facts, yet there's no evidence and facts supporting your policy to move to net zero emissions by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you one example. Even New Zealand proposes to largely exempt the agricultural sector from the net-zero-emissions goal which the New Zealand government legislated. Even New Zealand agreed to do that. But, when we saw the Leader of the Opposition in another train wreck of an interview on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> yesterday, he said: 'No. It applies to agriculture. It applies to transport. It applies across the board.' His answer on transport, I think, just showed how disconnected he is from everyday people in Queensland. He said, 'Well, they can catch public transport.' If you're operating a beef cattle station in Western Queensland, you can't just catch public transport. I'm sorry. It's not the inner city suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide. People in regional Queensland have a right to an answer to responsible questions, and one of those questions is: what is your policy going to cost, and what will it mean to those regional communities in my home state of Queensland which rely upon export-exposed industries?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anthony Albanese, in his interview on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, also said: 'Well, yeah, Australia will keep exporting thermal coal in 2050, probably. Absolutely. Why not?' With that export of thermal coal will go the jobs, just as we've seen BlueScope Steel set up a steel mill in Ohio because electricity prices here in Australia are too high, and just as we've seen Incitec Pivot set up an ammonium nitrate plant in Louisiana because electricity prices here are too high, and just as we've seen the owners of Boyne Island smelter in my home state of Queensland, Tomago aluminium smelter in New South Wales and Portland smelter in Victoria say electricity prices in this country are too high now. It is nonsense.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy is clear. We will achieve the treaty obligations which we entered into in Paris. We will achieve those obligations. Sometimes I wonder if those opposite this side of the chamber are actually standing up and fighting for the people of Australia or whether they're representing other people. They're certainly not representing the people of my home state of Queensland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's return to the matter at hand, which is taking note of the answers to questions posed during question time regarding net zero emissions and this government's failure to work collaboratively with the Australian community, with every state and territory government, with the Business Council of Australia, with the National Farmers Federation and with the biggest companies in this country to commit ourselves to what we've already committed to: the Paris Agreement. That is to keep global warming at less than two degrees. That is for net zero emissions by 2050. Australia ratified that treaty. Malcolm Turnbull, Julie Bishop and Josh Frydenberg—on behalf of this third-term seventh-year Liberal-National government—ratified the Paris Agreement. To quote Gladys Berejiklian, the Liberal Premier of New South Wales: 'Net zero emissions by 2050 is right in line with the Paris Agreement.' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extraordinary that this is even controversial. What Labor announced last week is not controversial. It is the commonsense, well-accepted, endorsed proposition of 73 countries. It's been ratified already by this Australian parliament, by this Liberal and National Australian government. It's been endorsed by all those businesses I spoke about earlier and by every state and territory, including Liberal state governments. The fact that this is somehow radical or unusual is just bizarre given that this is the commitment the globe has made. This is the commitment the globe has made and Australia has ratified. Climate change is real. Australians this summer—devastatingly and unfortunately—smelt it, felt it, breathed it in. Tragically, 33 people lost their lives, 3,000 homes were lost and nearly a billion wildlife, our native animals, were lost. That's the cost of climate change, and Australians experienced it in a very real and devastating way. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend I was at the New South Wales state memorial service for the victims of the bushfires. It was sombre and sad. It was extraordinary to see that this is what this country has come to, that in New South Wales we have had the most devastating natural disaster in living memory. And this side of the parliament, the government, this Liberal-National government, seems unwilling to recognise that the climate is changing, and we have already signed up to a target to keep global warming to less than two degrees, a target that is not all that controversial. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the impact on agriculture, because this is one question that Senator Ruston really failed to grapple with. The National Farmers Federation have a more ambitious aspiration than the Labor Party when it comes to net zero emissions. They want net zero emissions for agriculture by 2030. The meat and livestock of Australia have committed to be carbon neutral by 2030. Farmers for climate action support net zero by 2050. The reality is Australian businesses are moving in this direction, Australian farmers are moving in this direction, Australian state and territory governments are moving in this direction, because they know that to do otherwise will bring great economic cost, lost opportunity, a failure to grow economically, a failure to create new jobs and a failure to see ourselves become a renewable energy superpower. It's as if the other side were present at the invention of the automobile and decided we should all still stay in horses and buggies, to keep the buggy manufacturers going. We know that this country is going to have to face climate change, change and adapt, and that's what this target drives us to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  The Labor Party, clearly, has not learnt the lesson of the last election. The Labor Party and the Greens trumpeted the last election as 'the climate change election', at which the Australian people would be able to determine whether or not they accepted the Labor-Greens view of the world or the coalition view. Can I remind honourable senators opposite that the people of Australia very wisely adopted the coalition policy, in relation to climate change, on 18 May. They spoke. The quiet Australians spoke. Let me be very clear: the Australian people made a very commonsense decision. They asked one question: 'What is the pain-to-gain ratio? What is the pain going to be on my power bill, on jobs, on Australian wealth, in exchange for any potential benefit to the world environment?' Mr Shorten and the Labor Party were unable to answer either part of that question, of the pain-to-gain ratio. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know, and what Senator Scarr so very eloquently put to Senator Wong—who then of course had to use the racist card to try to overcome it, though everybody knew what Senator Scarr was referring to—is that the Australian Labor Party has deserted the Australian worker in favour of inner-city Greens. That is where the Labor Party are in a cleft stick. They do not know whether they support coalmining. You had Mr Shorten going up to Queensland during the election campaign and saying he supports coalmining and then, when in Victoria, saying, 'Well, I'm not sure I really support Adani.' Guess what? The Australian people didn't believe you, and for very good reason.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong and Senator Keneally refer to the experts time and time again. I've been listening to the experts now for 30 years telling me that there's going to be a tipping point in 10 years time. Well, after 30 years, the Australian people have a right to ask: 'Why is it that these predictions over 30 years have failed to materialise?' Why is it that, when experts assert quite loudly and blandly—Professor Tim Flannery, by the way—that the Brisbane River would never flood again and it's flooded twice since, they are never brought to account for those false prophecies? Similarly, they've asserted that the Murray River would never flow out to sea again. Yes, it has—another false prophecy. Yet, we're supposed to rely on these experts without question.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are more clever than the Australian Labor Party and their inner-city Green friends would like to think. Indeed, Senator Keneally just referred to the bushfires. Today we have an opinion poll that tells us that the Australian people are smarter than Senator Keneally and the Labor Party—because 56 per cent of the Australian people acknowledge that the bushfire problem that we had this year was not as a result of climate change but as a result of the failure of fuel reduction.</span>

                  </a>  This is what the Australian Labor Party do in these sorts of debates. When you've got them skewered, what do they do? They raise these frivolous points of order to try to distract people from the issues where the Australian Labor Party are so out of step with the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government are very clear: we believe that technology is the way to go. In my home state of Tasmania, Snowy Hydro 2.0, is a great example of government investing. Similarly, it's a great idea for the federal government to also invest in a feasibility study for a coal-fired power station in North Queensland. The two are not incompatible. Indeed, if we had spent just a very small fraction of the money spent on renewables on retrofitting our coal-fired power stations in Australia, we could have more energy and a 30 per cent reduction in our emissions. If only we could have done that with the taxpayer money.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other countries are referred to. What's the biggest industry in New Zealand? It is agriculture. And what have they done? They've said, 'We will commit to an emissions target, but'—out of the side of their mouth—'we won't be including agriculture in that.' Oh, really! Let's get a sense of reality. The Australian people are smarter. That's why they voted for us on 18 May.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  Well, it's all on display this afternoon, isn't it? Senator Ruston and Senator Cormann tried to run something approximating the line that the government may be a little bit committed to acting on climate change, but then Senator Scarr and Senator Abetz got up and let the cat out of the bag. Senator Scarr would prefer to just complain bitterly about the idea that any target at all might be set, while simultaneously being concerned that the target that's been set doesn't have enough detail attached to it—a recently inconsistent internal position, I'd suggest. Then Senator Abetz put the position that what we ought to have done over the last 30 years was spend all of our time investing in yesterday's technology and ignoring the technology that all of the global investment community tells us is the future—and that is renewable energy. It goes to the heart of the division in the government, and it explains, if anyone needs an explanation, why it is that for seven years this government has been completely unable to formulate an energy policy of any kind—not an emissions intensity scheme, not a clean energy target, not a national energy guarantee and not any of the other mechanisms that have been floated and discarded in the chaos of their party room.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad truth is that this is a group of people desperately torn between the siren call of populist denialism on display this afternoon and sensible, evidence based policy. They are torn between crude oppositionalism and the responsibilities of government, and they are increasingly landing on the wrong side of that divide. They're lured in by the culture warriors to the detriment of people they would ordinarily call allies.</span>

What do they make of all this nonsense here in this chamber? What do they make of a group of people who'd rather stoke wars on Twitter than get on with governing? What do they make of this?</span>

That state has committed to net zero emissions by 2050—words that cannot be said by either Senator Ruston or Senator Cormann in their answers this afternoon. Obviously, Mr Falinski and Mr Sharma find it all pretty embarrassing. They're willing to go on the record and say that Australia should get with the international community's program to tackle this problem which represents an existential threat—a threat to our biodiversity, a threat to our way of life and a threat to our economy.</span>

Mr Joyce is upstairs in the corridors of the press gallery, ranting about shrubs and manure. Mr O'Dowd is also talking about manure but in less parliamentary terms. All of them are apparently trying to engage on the question of emissions reduction in the agricultural sector. Their approach is not the approach taken by the National Farmers Federation. They've got a road map for net zero emissions by 2030. They're embracing the future with optimism, they're looking at the opportunities and they're making concrete plans for the future. That's actually what leadership looks like. That's what government requires. That would, amongst other things, require you to have an energy policy, because that is where the big gains are for Australia. Gains are there for consumers, because, if we had an energy policy, we'd have lower prices, we'd have lower emissions and we'd actually have an investment boom that drove jobs and opportunities in regional Australia.</span>

I think it's very important that we have this inquiry. It's a voice for the people to have their say. We need to get to the bottom of it. We know we've got a broken family law system.

You can't just ignore what is actually happening, and you can't blame one group or another. I know this. You needn't think that I don't have any idea of what domestic violence is. You have no idea of my previous life and what I've been through. You sit here and say that you need me off the committee when the fact is that I'm on the committee because I was the one that was driven to have this family law inquiry. What are the risks you've ever done? How many years has Senator Waters ever been in this place? What have you ever done to really care about the women or the children being murdered. This is why we definitely need the family law inquiry: to get to the bottom of it so people can get on with their lives and not destroy each other's lives or innocent children's lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked her where the money was for frontline services to protect women and children fleeing violence. Her answer was that that was a politicisation of this issue. It was kind of a bit ironic that she then went on to detail the funding that she says the government is in fact providing, but that wasn't politicisation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any event, that funding is absolutely pitiful. It is miniscule. It is not what's required. We know a good $5 billion and a 10-year funding commitment is what's required. But apparently it's all too complex. The minister said the issue is just too complex; it can't be fixed with funding. It would be a good start if crisis support services didn't have to turn women and children away because they don't have the resources to help them when they reach out for that help. The beds are full and some of the phone calls can't be answered because there are simply not enough resources. The government could fix this today and they should do so.</span>

                  </a>  States and territories have primary responsibility for the funding and provision of public dental services, including determining what services they provide and who is eligible. The Morrison government is supporting states and territories in this through a national partnership agreement. All jurisdictions have signed on to this agreement. Over three years the NPA will provide $350.3 million in funding to support services to around 580,000 public dental patients over four years. The Morrison government is currently in discussions regarding funding for dental services beyond the expiry of the current NPA. In contrast, when last in government, Labor cut $1 billion from Medicare for dental services and means-tested it, removing the chronic disease dental schedule. In addition, Labor cut $4 billion from the private health insurance rebate for consumers and means-tested it, going straight to the heart of affordability of dental coverage.</span>

                  </a>  All Australians are entitled to participate in the democratic process, including by financially supporting candidates and political parties. Australia has an appropriately robust system to regulate the disclosure and reporting of political donations. The government is committed to introducing a Commonwealth integrity commission that has the powers and resources it needs to be effective while also avoiding the pitfalls identified in the Greens proposal. The government CIC includes $106.7 million of new money committed in the last budget, nearly double what the Labor Party was prepared to commit. An exposure draft of the legislation to establish the CIC will be released for public consultation soon.</span>

It's an issue that the Greens have worked on for many years. It's an issue where for many years the sector have said that they don't have enough funds to help everyone who reaches out to seek their help when they flee violence. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had multiple inquiries about this. There have been multiple inquiries in state parliaments about this. Chief amongst the recommendations has always been that frontline services need more funding, which should not come as news to the government. I asked the question earlier today about when the sector will be heard and when the government will finally stump up the money to make sure that there are enough staff in those organisations so that women can be helped when they reach out, so that phone calls don't go unanswered and so that they don't have to say: 'No, the beds are full. We've got nowhere to put you.' Sadly, the response from the Minister for Women was that I was politicising the issue—</span>

                  </a>  because I was giving voice—and I'll take that interjection from Minister Ruston, who obviously concurs that it's somehow a politicisation to ask for more funding for organisations that exist on the smell of an oily rag, trying to stop people from being killed when they reach out for help and who have been saying over and over and over again that they don't have enough resources to keep women and children safe. If you think that's politicisation then every single person will be disgusted at that response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding that this government has provided is woeful. They often bang a drum about how they've put a little bit of money here and a little bit of money there, and that it's better than ever before. Well, great, but it's still not enough. Nine women now have been killed this year. Last year it was 61. It's been in the order of one woman or more a week for many, many years now. The funding is clearly not enough. When are you going to fix it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw late last week that the minister gave, I think, $2.4 million for men's behaviour change programs, but what a drop in the ocean. Clearly vastly more investment is needed in support programs like that, as well as frontline services for crisis response, and clearly for other prevention programs; $2.4 million is an absolute insult to all of the women and children who are living in fear of their very life. If the incidents of last week are not enough to shake the government out of their reverie, out of their denial about their ability to fix this problem, I don't know what is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen cuts to frontline domestic violence services by former administrations. The Abbott government did that. Thankfully, after pressure from this Senate, after an inquiry that I initiated and that reported in 2015, we saw the government overturn some of those cuts. But it didn't ever actually have a funding increase. And we've seen in recent years funding for National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services, or FVPLS, which is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women's service, being cut. We've seen the funding for a safe phone program—which allows women, who are often being tracked, to get free and to have those telecommunications without being bugged—reduced as well. In fact, they're facing funding uncertainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So don't sit here and tell us that you're doing everything you can when you are cutting funding to frontline services and when you are deaf to their calls for increased funding to help everybody that reaches out. In 2015, the sector said, 'Women are being forced to choose between violence and homelessness because there is not enough investment in crisis housing, and nor is there enough investment in long-term affordable housing.' You've had at least five years of that very poignant remark being put to you, and there is still inadequate funding for homelessness services and a failure to recognise that the largest—and growing—cohort of homeless people is older women, and many of those are fleeing violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many things that this government could be acting on: paid domestic violence leave, proper funding for the courts to address some of those backlogs, proper training for judges and for the police to properly deal with family violence and domestic violence situations, and axing the shared parenting presumption where violence exists. There are so many things, yet all you do is give the deputy chairship of a family law inquiry to Senator Hanson, who thinks that women lie about domestic violence and who this morning was excusing the actions of a murderer. It is disgusting, and it will not be forgotten.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Can I just say that I find it really disappointing that today we would be debating an urgency motion written in this way. While the Clarke family are grieving, while their friends and family are grieving and while the nation is grieving, I think it's particularly insensitive that we should be in here playing a blame game already. Today we should be honouring the bravery of Hannah, grieving for her loss and the loss of her children, and allowing Australians to come to terms with what has been one of the most horrendous tragedies that have ever happened in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we also must acknowledge that domestic violence in any form is unacceptable. We know that domestic, family and sexual violence is an issue for all Australians. It doesn't discriminate. It touches every corner of our communities and impacts people from all walks of life. It brings shame upon our nation. We know that overwhelmingly it's women and their children who are the victims of this violence. It is totally unacceptable that one woman a week should lose her life to a current or former partner. It's unacceptable that any woman should lose her life at the hand of a previous partner or a current partner. It is absolutely abhorrent, it's destructive and it has a lasting effect on those who have survived it and the families that have not. We must continue as governments—state government and federal government—and the community to make sure that we stamp out this scourge on our society. Responding to this issue is absolutely everybody's business. Whether it be our government, state governments, local government, the wider community, families or individuals, we all have a role to play. Whilst it's absolutely important that we provide sufficient resources to make sure that frontline services are available, money alone will not change the dial on this issue. We need to change people's attitudes to domestic violence, and that starts with respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, I would like to commend one of the programs as part of the series of action plans: the Stop it at the Start campaign. This campaign recognises that we need to break the cycle of domestic violence by encouraging adults to reflect on their own attitudes and to have conversations with children about respectful relationships. It aims to reset young people's attitudes by motivating their adult influencers as role models, such as parents, members of family, teachers, coaches and community role models. The campaign seeks to, through four stages, recognise that domestic violence absolutely is a true problem and understand where it can begin, and that's in childhood. We need to reconcile our role in the perpetuation of this situation; we need to respond by increasing confidence in everyone to take action; and we need to reinforce, through multiple voices, the breadth and sustainability of that campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first phase of the campaign, we aim to help adults recognise and understand the link between disrespect and violence and their influence on young people. In phase 2 we aim to help influencers to recognise what they could do to ensure that they are not misinterpreted by young people and to recognise their role in perpetuating disrespectful attitudes. We need positive role models. The third phase, which is just about to begin, aims to empower influencers to respond to the issue by reconsidering their own attitudes and behaviours and by having conversations with young people about respect. That's why the government has committed not just to dealing with a response to domestic violence but also to actively pursuing prevention and early intervention in order to ensure that we make the best use of the $340 million—the biggest ever commitment by a government—to address the scourge that is family and domestic violence under the fourth action plan to reduce violence against women and their children. This will take a significant and very sustained effort and we will not be able to do it alone. We will require partnerships with state and territory governments, who are the first-line responders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important that we get the language around this right. It is so important that we encourage everybody to come on this journey to stamp out this scourge on Australian society. We must make sure that our language isn't provocative and that it isn't unhelpful. In some instances we have seen language that we can only describe as downright repugnant. But if language is important then culture is important and changing behaviour is important—along with the money.</span>

They can access this service by calling 1800 737 732 or 1800RESPECT. If you or someone you know is in immediate danger, you should, of course, call 000 instead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today we observed a minute's silence for Hannah Clarke and her children. This was an important gesture, but, as a parliament, when we make gestures like this we also need to back them up. We need to commit to making sure that we do everything within our power to prevent tragedies like this from happening again. You may think that the incident in Camp Hill makes this a timely debate. But as much as this tragedy has received widespread media coverage, and as shocked and appalled as Australians are, let us not forget that one woman is murdered every week in Australia by a current or former partner. It is shocking enough that so many women are murdered, but the statistics on violence against women who survive are also quite shocking. I have taken these statistics from the website of Our Watch, which provides sources for each of the statistics. One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15 and one in five have experienced sexual violence. Women are three times more likely than men to have experienced violence from an intimate partner and four times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of this violence. Two-thirds of mothers with children in their care who have experienced violence from their previous partner say that their children have seen or heard the violence. So, we need to ask ourselves: what is the impact on these children?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to realise that violence against women takes many forms; it's not always just physical. It can include psychological, economic, emotional and sexual violence and abuse, and a wide range of controlling, coercive and intimidating behaviours. It's also important to realise that even when abuse in domestic and family settings doesn't involve physical violence it can still be extremely harmful and destructive to the victims and to any children involved. In addition to those women who are losing their lives, many more are suffering physical injuries, maiming and disfigurement, which, obviously, can easily lead to psychological injuries and ongoing trauma. This suffering is also experienced by children who are witnessing the violence or, even worse, having it perpetrated against them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from a wealth of evidence that leaving a violent relationship is not easy. We also know that the most dangerous time in a violent relationship is when the partner experiencing the abuse leaves. We know that the situation can be made safer for a victim when they have support around them. But, because perpetrators of domestic violence often seek to isolate their victims from friends and family, victims, when they try to leave, often rely on community services funded by government. Yet this government is failing victims by cutting services. It's absolutely outrageous that when we have a national crisis in domestic and family violence, and when there is a clear need to invest more in tackling the problem, this government is making cuts. The latest cut to family violence services is WESNET, a service which provides free, secure phones to women experiencing family violence so they cannot be tracked, traced or stalked by abusive partners. Yes, that's what often happens. Having a secure phone is often critical for a woman who is escaping a violent relationship. Since the program was established in 2016 WESNET has provided 20,000 of these phones. The program's national director, Karen Bentley, explained to the ABC that abusive ex-partners use mobile phones to track women and locate them after their relationship has ended. Ms Bentley said: 'Quite often they just either don't have a phone, they have never been able to have one, or their phone has been compromised by the abuser or potentially smashed or broken by the abuser.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is such a simple program, but it can make such a huge difference for women. This government's cut it, with funding running out later this year. Another recent cut was to the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Forum. This service assists First Nations women, who, sadly, are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised and 10 times more likely to be killed than other women as a result of violent assault. This organisation is the peak body for Indigenous survivors of domestic and family violence. It survives on a mere $244,000 a year. In the context of the federal budget that's basically spare change. But the penny-pinching government has cut it. And to add insult to injury, guess what day the government chose to announce this cut? It was 25 November, which also happens to be International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. That's true. I just couldn't believe it. It's such unbelievable irony that it could be funny if it weren't so cruel and tragic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask those opposite: when you cut these services to make a small saving here or there, do you really understand the cost? Do you realise the impact? Do you realise that these women and families need to have support at home, in the workplace and in the court system? If women escaping violence cannot be supported, we can expect more police callouts, more hospitalisations, more pressure on our mental health services and, sadly, more murders. It seems that those opposite are happy to push these costs on to the states and territories if it helps to protect their precious surplus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these cuts, the government is failing to invest in the resources needed in legal services and shelter for women escaping family violence. In my home state of Tasmania hundreds of women have been turned away from shelters, which are struggling and failing to keep up with demand. In 2017 I visited community legal centres with shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus to hear about the potential impact of a planned 30 per cent cut. Fortunately the government didn't go ahead with that cut, but even with their funding at that time CLCs were struggling to meet demand, including the massive demand from women escaping violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the Liberals at the federal level who are failing women escaping domestic violence. As I mentioned in an adjournment speech last year, Tasmania's Family Violence and Counselling Support Service is only funded to handle one-third of the referrals that they receive. This means they're faced with the difficult choice of turning away victims or not offering them the full support they need. They have decided not to turn anyone away, but without being able to give every client the full support and help they need, it makes it more difficult for the thousands of Tasmanian victims of domestic and family violence to safely escape. It's extraordinary that the recently retired Premier, Will Hodgman, is a White Ribbon Ambassador, yet he allowed this to happen under his watch. For the sake of women in my home state of Tasmania who are trying to escape domestic and family violence, I truly hope that the new Premier, Peter Gutwein, can take a more proactive approach and provide the FVCSS with the funding they need to do their job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, this is a national crisis and it needs an urgent national response. It requires awareness, community education and cultural and attitudinal changes. It requires support for victims to escape from violence and support for perpetrators to wake up and change their behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate opposition leader Anthony Albanese's call for a national summit on domestic and family violence. That is a practical first step that the Morrison government can take. Bring together government agencies, community groups, experts and victims to explore and develop a long-term response which drives long-term cultural change. But we need it now, not in a few years time. We need leadership to make sure that this doesn't fall off the agenda until the next tragedy occurs. While doing that, governments at all levels, including those opposite, need to recognise the need to invest in the services that we know work and which are already working on the front line in helping victims. We need investment, not more cruel cuts. I hope that the government take up Mr Albanese's call for a national summit and that they do it quickly, that they get some responses out and that they start to take action a lot more quickly.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this matter of public urgency. Senators spoke earlier today of the shocking murder of Hannah Clarke and her three young children. Tragically, events like their deaths at the hands of a parent and former partner are all too common. As legislators, we have the power to do more. That is why the announcement by the Minister for Social Services last week of only $2.4 million towards men's behavioural change programs has left me incredibly bewildered. The announcement is welcome, but it's only a drop in the ocean. The sector truly needs a lot more. On top of that, why is the funding only available in three states—New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia? The minister hasn't explained why the funding is so low and why the funding is limited to those three states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestic violence is borderless, affecting every community and socioeconomic group across the nation. My home state of South Australia is desperate for more funding for behavioural change programs. One South Australian service, KWY, do incredible work helping Aboriginal families in South Australia. The safety of women and children is at the heart of everything they do. They provide specialist knowledge and culturally appropriate services to break the cycle of domestic violence. They run a specialised 12-week Accountability, Responsibility to Change, ARC, program, using cultural ways to engage Aboriginal men. But, incredibly, South Australia was left out of last week's announcement, and programs like the one run by KWY are at risk because of very little funding. Indigenous Australians are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised for domestic violence than non-Indigenous people—32 times!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government is really serious about tackling the scourge of domestic violence in Australia, it needs to get serious about providing the funding that prevention and support services ask for, and not limit it to three states. At the moment, it's barely scratching the surface, and the women and children who are facing this daily reality very much deserve so much more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  Violence against women and children is not okay and we must never make excuses for behaviour of this type. The responsibility to end violence is one that we all share. Governments, communities, schools, workplaces, religious institutions and the media all have a role to play—we all have a role to play—in ending violence in our community. The violence we have seen in the past week with the deaths of Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful children at the hands of her husband, the children's father, is distressing and heartbreaking, and I hope to never hear of anything like this again. Our country has been deeply affected by these murders, and it is right that we examine what we can do to prevent such an incident being repeated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's first priority has always been to keep Australians safe and secure. We have a strong history of standing up against family, domestic and sexual violence. We know it is a major health and welfare issue that affects people of all ages and from all backgrounds, but we also know it mainly affects women and children. Under the government's National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022, we've invested millions in providing safe places for women and children escaping violence, such as emergency accommodation; prevention strategies to stop violence before it occurs; funding for 1800RESPECT, which is the national sexual assault, domestic and family violence counselling service; and increasing frontline services to help deal with such violence. The fourth action plan under this national plan, which was agreed with state and territory governments last year, will provide continued improvement to existing initiatives by identifying and addressing gaps from earlier action plans, and look at future policy areas as part of its review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the national plan's implementation 10 years ago, there has been evidence of an increase in reporting of family and domestic violence. This indicates that the quality and availability of support services are increasing, as is women's trust in them. Community awareness of violence against women and their children is growing, and the stigma associated with being a victim and seeking help is decreasing. These are good signs. First response counsellors with 1800RESPECT answered over 163,000 contacts in 2018-19, an increase of 66 per cent from the preceding year. Despite this increase, the plan states that the prevalence of violence against women in Australia remains largely unchanged, but:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the gap between prevalence rates and reporting rates is diminishing as more women than ever are feeling able to seek help and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good start, but there is still much more to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has a strong record in this area, and we're committed to continuing to build upon this work. We have already banned the direct cross-examination of women by their alleged perpetrator during family law proceedings. We've introduced domestic violence leave, and we've extended the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds to domestic violence survivors. We're providing no-interest loans to thousands of women experiencing family and domestic violence, and we have issued thousands of visas for women and children overseas needing safe refuge. Since 2013, we have invested more than $852 million to address the scourge of family, domestic and sexual violence. Further, we're committed to the ongoing improvement of the family law system to ensure that it helps families to separate in a safe, child centred, supportive, accessible and timely way. The establishment of a joint parliamentary committee of both the House of Representatives and the Senate will conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the family law system. This inquiry will hear from families accessing the family law system and provide a greater understanding of the issues and barriers they encounter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To stop violence against women, we need to counter the culture of disrespect towards women, as this is a precursor to violence. We need to change attitudes around violence by making sure that those who think violence is an option stop. The national primary prevention campaign, Stop it at the Start, encourages adults to stop and reflect on their attitudes and to discuss respectful relationships with children and young people. Evaluation of this program shows that the campaign is having an effect, and maintaining a continued focus on showing respect for others is vital within our community. I cannot stress enough to anyone who is experiencing family or domestic violence of any kind that help is available. I encourage you to act. Reach out to trusted family, friends or your doctor or simply contact 1800RESPECT—it's there for you. Domestic violence is a risk all women face; however, abuse can take different forms, none of which are acceptable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  One woman a week in Australia is murdered by a current or former male partner according to the Bureau of Statistics, and Aboriginal women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised and 10 times more likely to be murdered in a violent assault. I know this also firsthand from seeing it across the communities of the Northern Territory and listening to the women in the Northern Territory who speak often about their situation and the helplessness and the hopelessness that they feel in trying to remove themselves from those situations. We have terrific workers in our women's shelters and safe houses in our communities and, in particular, in our towns of Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin. I've spoken here on many occasions about the concerns those shelters have about continued funding support for the families—for the women and the children—who come looking for safety and looking for a way forward where they can be financially capable of standing alone with their children without being in a violent home life or with a violent partner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is more to this than funding, but I have to address the fact that there has been so much cut in the area of the services to our families—certainly across the Northern Territory, but I'm acutely aware of those same calls being echoed right across the country, including by organisations like the working women's centres in Australia. Many organisations have been shut down or defunded. We have a wonderful Working Women's Centre in the Northern Territory that's struggling. They're able to support and talk and listen to these women who come forward wanting to be financially stable and financially independent to be able to remove themselves from situations that are enormously violent for them and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there has to be an understanding. I know we say—and I've heard this a few times today—that we shouldn't politicise these events. I think we also have to be very realistic in understanding that, when you remove certain abilities for workers in those women's shelters, legal services and working women's centres, it has a profound and direct impact on the lives of Australian families who are in vulnerable positions. Putting your head in the sand and saying that that is not the answer is not the way to go—it really isn't. There has to be an injection of incredible amounts of support and resourcing for all of these Australians who work so hard to assist those families. Whether they're working, as I've said, in the working women's centres, in the women's legal services or in the Aboriginal community controlled organisations, they are critical at the front line of assisting our families who desperately need support and help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like everyone else in this country, was horrified to see what happened in Brisbane last week, and I certainly extend my condolences to the family of Hannah Clarke and her children. It was indeed an act of horrendous violence. But I've also seen similar acts on my families in the gulf region. I can stand here and say that nearly every second woman in my family has experienced some form of violence, and we live with it. We try to support each other. I have an aunty who was in a coma for six to eight months, just trying to recover from incredible abuse. She came through, but she lost a foot and some toes on the other foot, and she can hardly move her arm. So we look at what kind of support she can get with prosthetics to assist her in being able to continue to live in Borroloola, but it's hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the physical trauma. What about the emotional, spiritual and psychological trauma that a lot of these women do not have the chance to even talk through? They don't have a chance. We need these mental health workers. We need these counsellors. Certainly for First Nations women, we need them to be culturally appropriate services that can be spoken in language and can be in an environment where these women can talk about what has happened to them so that they can then share those stories, so that it can help our younger women, wherever they are, to stand up and know that there is support out there, not just in their families but also in the services that governments at every level—state, territory and local governments and this federal government—must be providing to our Australians who are enormously vulnerable in this position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been to the Darwin Aboriginal and Islander Women's Shelter and seen the amazing work of people like Regina Bennett, who runs that organisation on the smell of an oily rag, really. The dedication and the loyalty of people like her and her team to ensure that they are there for these women is outstanding. I commend people like Regina and others who are working in our safe houses across the Northern Territory and right across Australia. What I'm saying here is not just isolated to the Territory. I know that there are services in every state and territory whose employees try to work with vulnerable families. You think you can take that money from this bucket here and put it over there and that should be okay, but it's not okay. There is a correlation between when you remove resourcing and when these organisations step up and say: 'This is going to dramatically impact us. We're going to lose a counsellor. We're going to lose a mental health worker. We're going to lose an Aboriginal interpreter.' That has a direct impact on these families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we heard that the Morrison government told the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Forum that its $244,000 a year funding would not be renewed past June 2020. That forum is critical in bringing Indigenous women's voices to the table when family violence policies and approaches are being discussed. The amount of money the government is cutting is minuscule in terms of what the government can afford. The government goes to the Tindal air base and says, 'Here's a billion dollars for the Air Force,' yet it removes $244,000 which impacts on the women in the Katherine region. It just doesn't make sense. That's where you—the government senators and the government members—have to see that there is a direct correlation between those decisions. The forum had a meeting with the Minister for Indigenous Australians earlier this month, but, despite making sympathetic noises, the minister was unable to give the forum any assistance or any assurance that they would be able to operate into the future. They're asking for $244,000 a year. Instead, the minister has told the sector, already thinly resourced and outstretched, to engage in a co-design process. But the sector is very strongly of the view: why redesign something they know already works?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an idea of how this government's cuts will impact services on the ground in the NT. The National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Forum supports small, culturally appropriate Indigenous frontline services to ensure their experiences and views are reflected in national discussions. So, if you're going to remove it, you're saying to the women of the Northern Territory that, in this instance, their voices don't matter, but you're also saying to the vulnerable women right across Australia that it's not a priority. Listening to Senator Cormann and other senators speak today, I know that you know it's important. I'm just asking you to recognise that, when you make those decisions of funding, it does have a profound and direct impact on our families across Australia when these organisations either are so underresourced or have to close shop. It's not good enough.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise to contribute to this matter of urgency on the national security crisis of violence against women. In the wake of the truly horrific murder of Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful, innocent children, it is absolutely essential that we as a nation reiterate that violence is never acceptable in any form. There is never any justification. There are no excuses, no ifs and no buts—none. We need to call out the toxic culture of some men and their supporters, some of whom raised these issues in this place, who think they are entitled to exert power and control over women. That is at the heart of this towards women and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women think that they can rely on the justice system and the police to respond to the violence that is being perpetrated against them, but too often we see that that is not the case. We see in the media today that there's a very brave woman who took her own civil action because the police didn't think it was in the public interest to prosecute when someone doused her in petrol and threatened to set her alight. We see domestic violence orders—they're called other things in other states; AVOs—simply ignored and not worth the paper they're written on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we say that people can have confidence in our justice systems when this is continuing to happen? For every woman—we have heard that one a week that loses her life—there are thousands of women and their children who are living the daily reality of violence and abuse. Exposure to violence against their mother or other caregivers causes profound harm to children and has life-long effects on those children. It is not good enough to say, 'Well, it's okay, we're giving money—we're spending this and we're spending that' when we know that $5 billion is needed to address this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just at the end of last year, the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services were told that their funding of only $244,000 was going to be cut. The government used as a weak excuse the supposed recommendations of a report, when the report made no recommendations at all. The government needs to act to stop that. We just heard Senator McCarthy's contribution about the 32-fold impact of domestic violence on First Nations women; yet the government thinks it's okay to cut funding to one of their essential services. In 2006, the Howard government made the mistake of amending the family law to put parents' shared care above the interest of the child. It was a fundamental mistake, and we called it out at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These mistakes cannot continue. We need to invest; we need to change the laws; we need to enforce the current laws and change the laws to ensure that this doesn't happen. Importantly, we have to call out any excuse for violence. There is no excuse. We have to call it out every single time. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I was at the vigil in Camp Hill last night when Nikki Brookes spoke bravely for her beautiful friend, Hannah Clarke, and her children, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey. I want to refer to some of her speech now to remind all of us in this chamber of the important things she had to say. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are a nation in pain, whether you knew our beautiful Hannah or not, we are all deeply affected by this tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see her face on television, her smile like sunshine. She has the face of a friend. And maybe that's what it is that hurts—that she is so instantly relatable and that we are not only heartbroken for her family but we have all become a little scared for our own. I wish I had something profound to tell you: the perfect message of how we stop the violence, how we take away the rage. But, if I had it all figured out, we wouldn't be standing here today. What I will tell you is that in their short lives, Hannah, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey loved hard and laughed hard every day. Hannah carried the weight of the world on her shoulders and you never knew it. Her strength of character was only matched by her wicked sense of humour. Giggles filled their days and they were truly happy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want us to get caught up in a blame game that takes us beyond the animal that did this. There was no excuse. There could never be an excuse—no buts. The blame lives and dies with him. You can do all the calls to arms you want. You can blame the system and demand change, but there is no quick fix. I don't think there's a single law or order that would have saved our darlings. Monsters find a way. So what can we do?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Little boys in pain grow into angry men. I want every person in this crowd to now turn to someone right now and cuddle them. Last night at the vigil, strangers did. She said, 'Get used to saying, "I love you," out loud. Say to our babies that being tough and strong isn't just physical; kindness is emotional strength.' She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Stop being so polite. 'It's none of our business', and 'I don't want to get stuck in the middle', are keeping secrets silent and the suffering is breeding …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those phrases are isolating. Don't back away from your friends for the sake of convenience. Don't be gutless. If you see something, say something. One by one, we can let the world know we won't stand for this anymore. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said, 'The time is up for domestic violence.' Gosh, she said it well. No parent ever should have to experience what Suzanne and Lloyd Clarke have over the last week. When I think of the cruelty and pain inflicted on Hannah, Laianah, Trey and Aaliyah by a father whose basic duty was to love and protect them, I feel sick. And yet this happens. Murder happens. Perhaps it happens less dramatically and perhaps less visibly, but it happens to another woman every week. It's not okay. It's never okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestic violence must end. I actually don't like the term. It shouldn't be treated like it is something different or less than because it is connected to the family. If anything, it's worse. It is a bigger breach of trust. It's a bigger betrayal of the oath between husband and wife, between parent and child, and yet every two minutes the police get a call out about a family violence incident. I'm sad to see Senator Di Natale attempt to politicise this sad and complex social issue with this motion, because it crosses generations and cultures, it crosses through the rich and through the poor, and it isn't the sole result of alcohol or other substance abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Not now</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> not ever</span> report commissioned by the Newman government was given to the Queensland government. This cross-party task force included people who worked in the area of domestic violence, including in Indigenous groups and in multicultural groups, and led by former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce. The report lists a range of factors which contribute to domestic violence and the danger that women find themselves too often in in the trying to get out of dangerous relationships. Those factors include the law, police, culture, different cultures in our community, generational abuse, substance abuse and the availability of safe places to go. When you look at what Hannah had done, it was clear she had good advice on getting out safely. She had reported the latest violence against her to the police. She had moved out. She was living with her parents. She had identified safe houses in her local area. She'd had an order issued that was supposed to protect her. She did everything right—textbook, really. She was smart, well educated, healthy, beautiful and a great example to her children, with a loving, supportive extended family. Maybe that's why it hurts so much, because we don't expect bad things like this to happen to people who look like her, but they do. It touches all walks of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened to Hannah and her children was pure evil, but the question of what we do next is hard. We as a government can't legislate for people to be kind. We can't legislate for love. Nikki correctly identified that little boys in pain grow into angry men and that it's the parents' job to model and show them how to love one another. They also need to show little girls what conduct is and isn't acceptable to receive from the people they love. Parents are working on this, and there are social workers and chaplains in virtually every school in this country working with children from homes that are not safe, trying to make that change. As I said, we can't legislate kindness, but, in the event that a person finds themselves in a violent situation of this kind, there are now more practical measures in place than ever to help them get out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Prime Minister, along with the then Minister for Women, committed $328 million funding for the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children between 2010 and 2022. It's record funding. There is $68.3 million worth of funding for prevention measures to stop violence before it even happens, $35 million specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community women and $78 million for shelters and women seeking safety from their abusive partners. And, since 2015, the coalition has spent $840 million to help suffering domestic violence victims get out and rebuild their lives. In the 2019-20 budget, the minister secured more funding to speed up parenting payment processing times and property settlements. Seven million dollars was committed to the creation of the Family Violence and Cross-Examination of Parties Scheme—funds for legal aid expressly to ensure that a person injured by domestic violence doesn't have to face their abuser in court. That has been complemented by an amendment to the Family Law Act banning self-representation in these instances. And $31.8 million was allocated to Commonwealth funded specialist units, while $50.4 million went into family law property mediation services. In 2018, the then minister introduced five days of unpaid family and domestic violence leave. It was the first time any government had enshrined that as a workplace right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubting that family breakdown is among the hardest things a person can ever experience in their life—a situation made more complex when drugs, mental health issues and child safety concerns are added into the mix. We can't expect any government to be able to turn this trauma into a happy time of life, but we as a government, as families, as friends and as communities can and must do everything possible to keep each other safe. It's time we looked not just to the government but also to what we as individuals can do, because more of this just will not do. Lloyd, I gave you a big hug last night, with tears in both our eyes. We won't forget Hannah and we won't forget her kids. We won't give up on making this right.</span>

                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  The shocking murder last week of Hannah Clarke and her three lovely children is the latest tragedy in an all-too-often repeated horror across our nation. As a father of two daughters, my heartfelt desire is that they are able to contribute and thrive in a society that values their opinion and provides them the opportunity to live free from harm, fear and retribution. I want my daughters—and all daughters and all Australian women—to always be safe in their home and as they go about their daily lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the motion for debate today focuses on questions of Commonwealth funding—and that is a very important part of the picture—I think it's true to say that successive governments and, indeed, our political processes as a whole have failed to deal with this horrific issue. There have already been many inquiries and reports: the Victorian royal commission, two inquiries undertaken by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee and a recent Auditor-General's report on the implementation of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Yet nothing much has changed. The national rates of serious crime, murder and assaults are falling, but the rate of family violence is, sadly, static. Things are not getting any better. On average, one Australian woman is killed by an intimate partner each week. Hannah Clarke was the eighth woman murdered by her former partner in Australia this year. Australian police deal with 5,000 domestic violence matters on average every week. That's one every two minutes, and 20 since this debate commenced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts in funding of frontline social welfare and support services definitely haven't helped, but they are only a small part of a complex picture. Moreover, against a backdrop of terrible tragedy and hurt, there is no merit in partisan argument and finger-pointing. What we do need right now is collective action across the Australian parliament to pressure governments—federal, state and territory—to tackle this issue in ways that really will make a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, I am proposing an urgent inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee into family violence, especially violence against women and their children. The focus of the inquiry will be on action, not endless investigation. We know about the prevalence of domestic violence. We know its causes and it contributing factors. We know its effects on health, we know the impact on children, we know its financial impact and we know the impact on the community. The dimensions of the problem are really clear and we don't need to re-examine that. Rather, we need a process through which senators can directly pressure governments on the steps they need to take and the resources that need to be committed now that will eliminate domestic violence from our Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at where we can drive change in government policy, programs and resourcing to improve outcomes. With strong commitment from senators from all sides of politics we can do all of this and more. It is high time that all sides of this parliament and especially all segments of Australian society and indeed most particularly men face up to our collective responsibilities and work for real change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I rise to contribute to this debate. I'm just following on from Senator Patrick. I commend Senator Patrick and Senator Griff for being two men participating in this debate today, and I too reflect on the observation of the lack of male voices in this debate. I know this is a constrained amount of time. It is only an hour and lots of people want to speak. I would be more than happy to step aside if there were a male colleague from any side of politics who wanted to participate in this debate today, because I think it is absolutely important that decent men become part of this very-much-needed discussion about how we solve these issues going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know too many women and their children are at risk and are living in fear right now, today, in their own homes as we pay tribute to and grieve for the loss of life over the last week of Hannah Clarke and her children and, sadly, another woman who was murdered at the hands of her partner only days later in Townsville. Sadly, these statistics should not be shocking, because they are so regular. That is what is wrong here. But when something as grievous and as horrific happens as what occurred last week in Brisbane, there is a glimmer of hope that people were so outraged and so touched by this. I myself felt quite haunted by it. I couldn't shake, for two days, the stories, the reports and the images that I had seen. I could not stop thinking about Hannah and those children. I had never met this family. I know nothing about them apart from what I've read since this tragic event, but it shook me deeply—and I think many, many Australians feel the same. That's why we're discussing this today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have to use that grief, that anger and that frustration to call for genuine and real action. As my colleagues Senator Waters and Senator Siewert have mentioned today, at the very least we should be able to commit, from a funding perspective, that no woman is ever turned away when she asks for help. When she is in danger, she should be able to get a safe place for her to sleep and a safe place for her children to be. There should be somebody at the end of the phone when a woman calls in desperate need of assistance. The fact that there is not is a national shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that this issue is now at such an epidemic rate that one woman is killed a week is not okay. It is 2020 in modern Australia, where equality is meant to be part of the norm, where young girls are brought up believing they can be anything, that they are equal. To see the reports of mothers and their children being murdered at the hands of the very people who are meant to love and protect them, I can tell you that equality still has a long way to go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has finally responded to the select committee report. The Joint Select Committee on oversight of the implementation of redress related recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse—a committee on which I was a very active participant—made 29 recommendations, and I want to highlight some of the important recommendations. Recommendation 1 is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that any amendment to the scheme proceed on the principle of 'do no further harm' to the survivor, be subject to proper consultation with key survivor groups, and appropriately incorporate feedback from those consultations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government agrees with this recommendation. I certainly hope the government takes this to heart, because, at the moment, the implementation of the scheme is in fact causing distress to a lot of people. Although, I will acknowledge that there have been improvements in the application of the scheme, there are still some major issues—which I will go to in a second. Very strongly, the feedback is that it is still causing a great deal of distress to people. So there are still quite a lot of actions that need to be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 relates to institutions that haven't opted in yet. We all know that there are a number of institutions that have not opted in. The government agrees that the Commonwealth, states and territories need to maintain pressure on these institutions. This is getting absolutely critical, because June 2020—this year, in only a few months time—is the cut-off time for opting in for these institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next recommendation related to using a particular mechanism that could be used to apply pressure, and that relates to the powers under the Charities Act 2013 to penalise all relevant institutions that fail to join the scheme, including the suspension of all tax concessions for, and charitable status of, an institution that hasn't joined in. The government only notes this recommendation. It's absolutely essential that these institutions actually do opt in and that the government uses everything it can to cause these institutions to opt in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to the next recommendation, recommendation 4, which talks about the funder of last resort. We had a significant debate in this chamber about the funder of last resort, and certainly the Greens made the point that we don't think the current provisions are adequate. This was highlighted to me last week when I was at a meeting with some First Nations people in Western Australia, my home state. One of the institutions there does not have a body that can be held accountable, from what I understood from our discussion. This brings up very strongly what happens to those 600 people, as I understand it, who went through that institution. Who is going to make sure that they get access to redress without having to go through the courts? This is why we were pursuing this issue so strongly. The government only notes this recommendation. It needs to take this very seriously. We know the deadline of June 2020 for institutions to opt in is coming up. The federal government and the state and territory governments need to be really seriously considering what they're going to do about the funding of last resort. There are many recommendations here—I know I'm going to run out of time—on which the government says, 'Oh, yeah, we have to go back to the states and territories.' I'm so sick of hearing that complaint in here. We expect some leadership from the Commonwealth on many of these absolutely critical issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the old thorny recommendation about the maximum payment, where the government only went with $150,000 rather than $200,000, we made a number of recommendations in the committee about that. The government only notes those recommendations. I strongly urge it to take that back to the states and territories, because, if there's one thing I hear constantly from survivors, it is that they feel diddled because the scheme did not go with the $200,000 recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other key recommendations relate to indexing and the fact that that's taken into account. People again feel diddled. Then, of course, we have the issue around non-sexual abuse, and the government notes that particular recommendation. That's one that's a really significant issue for people, because they have no redress if they had violence but not sexual abuse.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I write regarding your question asked during the committee-of-the-whole phase of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Illegal Phoenixing) Bill 2019, regarding ATO practice. Specifically, you asked about situations where a good corporate citizen has not been paid for work it has done, and is faced with the choice between using cash reserves to pay either a subcontractor or a tax liability. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO recognises that small businesses may, on occasion, experience cash flow issues for a number of reasons, including in very unfortunate situations due to the actions of others who engage in illegal phoenixing activity, that prevent them paying on time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO encourages all small businesses who may experience difficulty in meeting any of their obligation to contact the ATO to discuss their circumstances. The ATO will work with the business to understand their situation and consider the best assistance that may be available for them. There are a range of options available, depending on their individual circumstances— including for example tailored payment plans or remission of interest charges. Last year, more than 800,000 payment plans were entered into with small businesses. </span>

In cross-examination in 2017, the CSIRO admitted that today's temperatures are not unprecedented. Yet Senator Cormann relies broadly and without specifics on the UN's discredited Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He cites two page numbers on which the UN IPCC makes claims without providing empirical, scientific data within a scientific framework that proves causation—useless! Senator Cormann gives us no proof of human carbon dioxide causing climate variability—none, nil, zip. He and his Liberal and Nats colleagues hide behind the UN smokescreen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately I have the antidote: cold hard facts and data. Let me share just some. Each of the UN IPCC's five reports to media and governments is based on a lie. They're a litany of lies. The 1990 report was based on a false claim that reversed the scientist's conclusion that there was no evidence of global warming, and none due to human carbon dioxide. The 1995 report was more brazen. It was based on one scientist, Ben Santer, reversing the scientist's own report. The original 1995 report on the science said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2001 the next report from the UN was based on the infamous 'hockey stick' temperature graph, whose authors refused to release their data to public scrutiny. That should have meant that we discard it. Instead it was lionised by the UN and by Al Gore and entrenched in people's minds in headlines. In 2007 the UN based its report on unvalidated and erroneous computer models proven hopelessly wrong. The 2014 report, which Senator Cormann has referenced, was also based on unvalidated and erroneous computer models proven hopelessly wrong. The 2014 report's sole chapter claiming warming—that's chapter 10—in its opening sentence misrepresents reality by implying warming from 1951 to 2010, and similarly on page 878. Both are false. From 1958 to 1975 global atmospheric temperatures cooled; 1976 saw a sudden small rise due to the entirely natural Great Pacific Climate Shift over one year, followed, from 1995 through to 1998, by a very modest warming trend. From 1995 to 1998 temperature had been flat, and every year since 1998 was cooler than 1998. In 57 years of atmospheric temperature measurements, temperatures have shown no warming or have been cooling for 34 years. That's 60 per cent of the time with no warming. At the time of the report, in 2013-14, the trend was 16 years of ongoing lack of warming, despite ever-rising human carbon dioxide output due largely to China and India. Yet there is no warming trend, and that continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report identifies no plausible, logical, scientific reasoning for attributing modest cyclical warming to carbon dioxide from human activity. That contradicts empirical scientific evidence and factors needed to claim causal relationships. The report contains no empirical scientific evidence and no logical scientific reasoning for claiming that human carbon dioxide causes warming. It fails to identify any difference between current temperature variability and past temperature variability. Comparisons revealed both previous cycles are similar in modest extent and rate of warming and cyclical stasis after each warming—just a natural cooling and warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its latest report in 2014, confidence in UN IPCC projections was raised arbitrarily to 95 per cent. That implied statistical validity. If the 95 per cent is not statistically derived, it's politically fabricated—just pulled out of the air. To paraphrase and build on the words of Canadian statistician Ross McKitrick, in previous years the UN IPCC was wrong about the Arctic, wrong about the Antarctic, wrong about the tropical troposphere, wrong about atmospheric temperatures, wrong about the ground based surface temperature, wrong about ocean temperatures, wrong about hurricanes, wrong about sea levels, wrong about the Himalayas, wrong about sensitivity, clueless on clouds and useless on regional trends. And, on that basis, it raised its confidence to 95 per cent. Canadian statistician Steve McIntyre's early investigation of the UN's 2014 report reveals that the UN has cooked the figures to falsely show that, although there had been a lack of warming for 16 or 17 years at the time, the temperatures at the time fall within the range of its early predictions. They did not. Steve McIntyre said that earlier UN temperature projections:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… have been shifted downwards relative to observations, so that the observations are now within the earlier projection …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN report tried to misleadingly hide the fact that, contrary to UN projections, ground based temperatures had not risen since its second report in 1995. If the UN IPCC that Senator Cormann relies upon were a corporation, an accountant or financial prospectus, it would be jailed.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />A critique of the report by the internationally acclaimed independent climate scientist, the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, found that the UN has retreated on at least 11 alarmist claims in prior reports. The new summary for policymakers in 2014 had at least 13 misleading or false statements, and another 11 statements are phrased to mislead the readers or misrepresent important aspects of the science. American climatologist Dr Judith Curry is a professor and chair of the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.

The word 'confidence' appears 127 times. The word 'may' appears 79 times. The word 'expect' appears 63 times. It's just a litany of propaganda. The repetition of key words is propaganda to conjure unfounded feelings of confidence and likelihood, and it fooled Senator Cormann. Yet there is a complete lack of empirical scientific evidence that human carbon dioxide causes climate change and needs to be cut. In the real world of science—proper science—propaganda is not science. In the politicised and ideological world of the UN and the Liberal Party though, it is a replacement for science.

Senator Cormann and the government have failed to provide any scientific basis for their climate position. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  Notwithstanding its origins up the back with the tinfoil hat brigade, Labor was happy to support this order for production of documents, because it should be very easy to satisfy. The evidence for human induced climate change is vast, well substantiated and detailed. I believe in climate change, and so do my colleagues. We believe in it because tens of thousands of qualified scientists over decades have measured it and experimented and modelled it. Climate change is real. We should not have to say that in 2020, but there it is. Climate change is real. If there's not enough empirical evidence out there for you, the problem isn't with the evidence. Evidence doesn't stop being evidence and it doesn't stop being empirical just because you disagree with it or don't like what it tells you. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a climate conspiracy, but it is not a conspiracy by the tens of thousands of scientists who have contributed to our current understanding. It is a conspiracy by climate denialists to muddy the waters of what is now a very clear scientific consensus. Back in 1995 a Republican strategist, Frank Luntz, was encouraging Republican members to challenge the science. He suggested you do this 'by recruiting experts who are sympathetic to your view'. Ten years later he was still at it, with a 2001 memo that said: 'The scientific debate is closing but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science. You need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.' He's not the only one to attack the science for political reasons. The flood of misinformation has not abated in the years since. International organisations like the Heartland Institute actively promote false or misleading information about climate change. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot allow the debate about climate change in this country to be derailed by misinformation in the way that it has been in the United States and elsewhere. We have known about the threat of climate change for decades, and the science has only got more certain over time. The truth is that Australians and Australia are uniquely vulnerable to climate change. It places us at risk of longer and deeper droughts, more destructive cyclones and other weather events and, as we saw over the summer, more horrific fire seasons. In 2018 a heatwave saw fruit bats drop dead from the sky. In 2019 heat and drought saw massive fish kills along Australia's waterways. 2020 started with fires that have destroyed up to 80 per cent of our koalas' natural habitats, destroyed thousands of homes and tragically seen too many lives lost. These fires were described as unusual, extraordinary and unprecedented. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not business as usual, and yet the government continues to behave as though it couldn't care less. One possible benefit of collating these documents for Senator Roberts may have been that the government would have had the opportunity to reacquaint itself with some of the basic facts. However, their performance over the last few days suggests that, like One Nation, they are full to the gills with climate deniers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have come to the sad conclusion that this government will never take significant action on climate change. They are divided down the middle with downright deniers of the science of climate change, and they seem to dictate the government agenda and there appears to be nothing capable of shifting them. Would the environmental burden change things, perhaps, after a summer in which 33 people lost their lives and 3,000 homes were destroyed? The government's policy remains non-existent. Would the economic burden change things? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to recent research from the University of Melbourne, the cost to Australia of not delivering on the goal of the Paris Agreement, a goal that requires net zero emissions by 2050, is a staggering $2.7 trillion. Yet there's been nothing, no meaningful climate response, from government. Would calls from stakeholders shift this government? Everyone from the National Farmers Federation to the Business Council of Australia is calling for action. No. The truth is this: for a decade, a rump of conservatives in the coalition have blocked every attempt to move the country forward, and they still hold the whip hand—like newly-appointed Minister Keith Pitt, the new minister for resources, who claimed solar panels and lithium batteries could turn out to be this generation's asbestos; former deputy Nationals leader Senator Matt Canavan calling renewables the dole bludgers of the energy system, a phrase distasteful for more than one reason; or Senator Jim Molan, who recently told our national broadcaster that he's not relying on evidence in forming view about climate change. Is there any hope that this government will act? Sadly, I have concluded, no. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will act. I was proud to see the opposition leader on Friday announce our commitment to a net zero target by 2050. Our target is what the world—Australia included—agreed to in Paris. Whether the Morrison government accepts this or not, this goal is fast becoming the reality. Australia has lost 10 years to baseless fear campaigns against climate action and we cannot afford to lose another 10.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has tabled those responses. I will note that the government, in those responses, continues to say that the minister has made a public interest immunity claim with respect to any legal advice obtained in relation to the income compliance program—into the circumstances surrounding any legal advice obtained in relation to the income compliance program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community affairs committee rejected that claim for public interest immunity, saying that we didn't think it met the requirements of a public interest immunity claim, in that the government and the minister did not outline how it would hurt the public interest to produce that legal advice. The minister has now tabled answers to other questions that we asked, and in some instances they're useful; in others they're not. We still do not have an understanding of how many debts are affected by the government's suspension of the program of income averaging. We do not know how long the government has known that the robodebt process was illegal, which debts are illegal, when people will be compensated, how long it will take the government to review the debts and what the final process is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we had the hearing on 16 December we only heard about the first level of review that is being undertaken. We expected that that first review, and the department led us to believe that, would be undertaken or completed towards the end of January. Yet we still have not heard what the next phase of the process is and how many debts are involved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Senate inquiry process and the ongoing court case, we are learning more about the government's position. For example, the government don't think that they have a duty of care to the people who have been traumatised and demonised by robodebt. The government claim that they deny allegations of duress. Well, tell those people, who have had debt collectors turned up on their doorstep, that they don't think that they have been under duress. Tell people who are getting notices—and who got robodebt notices over the last three years—that they shouldn't feel duress that they got these notices for, in some cases, tens of thousands of dollars, and now, as it turns out, a lot of them are illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the legal advice that we have been seeking is a further outline of the process of garnishing by the ATO. The government has ramped up their garnishing of people's tax returns. The first thing that people know about a robodebt is when their tax returns get garnished. For those people you can guarantee that most of those debts will have been done through income averaging because, if somebody doesn't know about it, they haven't responded to the letters. They have moved—quite a while ago, because some of these debts stretch back a large number of years. They have moved, so they have never had the contact from the department. The first thing they know is they get garnished. That will have been done by income averaging—income averaging that is illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How long has the government been doing this? I was asking in the hearing on 16 December: 'Can't they stop? Are they able to stop some of this garnishing? Weren't they able to identify which ones were done by income averaging?' The ATO said, 'No, that's up to the department.' The department will know very well which of those debts are income averaged and which ones aren't. How many resources are now being put over to looking at these robodebts? How much time from the department now is being taken up looking at robodebts? We still don't know the answers to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to go back to this duty of care and the government claiming they don't have a duty of care. To say I was gobsmacked that government claims it doesn't have a duty of care to Australians on our income support system is to put it mildly. It is unbelievable that the government is running that line in its court case trying to defend its illegal robodebt system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Bernard Keane—in a very interesting article, I will say—rightly points out, the idea that the government does not have a duty of care towards its citizens is at odds 'with the core principles' of our social security system. I couldn't agree more. He also then points out that the DSS <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security Guide </span>clearly states that duty of care means:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian government employees have a duty of care to the public when performing their duties. This advice extends to any advice given and any actions performed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Public Service has a duty of care to those accessing our social safety net, but the Australian government doesn't have a duty of care?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that our government does not care about people on our social security system. It cannot escape the fact that our social security system is, in fact, built on a social contract that provides people with a minimum standard of living. That's the very basis of our social security legislation. That's the basis on which people trust our government. There is a contract with our government, a social contract, that they will provide a minimum standard of living for people. The fact that that's below the poverty line is something I have debated in here before and I'll continue to raise, but there is an expectation from our community that our government does take a duty of care to its citizens, and particularly those who have fallen on hard times and need support through our social security system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 600,000 debts have been issued under robodebt. We still don't know how many of those are illegal, how many of those were done strictly by income averaging and how many of those had some income averaging, but we know that there are a lot. The community deserves answers, and we're not getting them from the government. We simply don't know how many of these debts are illegal. We don't know when the government intends to let people know. We don't know if Australians are going to be reimbursed and also compensated for the very real distress they suffer when they get a letter in the mail that says they owe money. The government likes to use semantics and say, 'That's not a debt notice.' As soon as somebody gets a letter indicating that the government thinks they owe money, whether it says they have to pay it now or not, they get nervous and think that they owe money—money that they don't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard more and more in the community about the other thing people have done. If it is between $1,000 and $2,000, people, particularly if they are working—if the social security system has done its job and supported people while they looked for work and they found work—are just paying it. They don't fight it, because they don't want the hassle of interacting with the government. They just want to get it off the books. They don't want to be in trouble. They believe the government. Potentially, people haven't challenged thousands of debts that they didn't owe. Time and time again I'm being told that. Then you have people still on social security not being able to get advances in their payments because the government says that they owe money, so they're getting further and further into poverty. More than likely they're going to dodgy loan sharks and payday lenders and running up more bills. They are being driven further and further into poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Robodebt is a mess. The government need to come clean. They need to tell us when they knew that this was illegal. How long have they known? How many debts are illegal? They need to come clean and say, 'Yes, we know we have a duty of care to our community.' Of course they do—they're the government. Of course they have a duty of care to the citizens of this country. It is completely objectionable that the government think they have caused no distress to and no duress for people and that they think they have no duty of care. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the increasing need for individuals to access tertiary education to upskill and reskill throughout their life, in order to meet the evolving demands of the labour market. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To support this, the Bill seeks to extend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Student Identifiers Act 2014 </span>to higher education, providing a single government-issued student identifier in the tertiary education sector. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time, all tertiary education students, across VET and higher education, will use one number throughout their education journey that stays with them for life. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will also help students engage with their learning and contribute to the lifelong learning eco-system, encouraging Australians to up-skill and re-skill, building their careers to fulfil their goals and aspirations. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Starting in 2021, new higher education students can apply for a USI and by 2023, all graduating higher education students will need a USI before they can receive their award, unless an exemption applies. It is estimated 300,000 USIs will be issued to higher education students in 2020-21; 1.4 million USIs in 2021-22; and around 500,000 each year thereafter.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A national USI will record a student's entire tertiary education journey, enabling students to have greater autonomy and control over their education.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will also strengthen the integrity and richness of data available, helping us to gain a better understanding of student pathways across tertiary education. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This robust evidence base will help inform future policy development and program delivery, and in doing so, further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Government's investment in tertiary education.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The USI will replace the existing Commonwealth Higher Education Student Support Number, also known as a CHESSN, reducing the number of student identifiers in tertiary education from two to one.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the turn of the century, the total number of students in higher education has grown dramatically—from 842,000 in 2001 to over 1.5 million in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that an investment in a post-school qualification is one of the best decisions an individual can make—whether it be through vocational education and training or higher education. Tertiary graduates enjoy consistently higher employment levels than those who complete secondary schooling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The higher education sector has long supported the establishment of a USI. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2009, COAG recognised the importance of establishing a national USI to support a seamless transition between schooling, VET and higher education. Since that time, USIs were introduced to the VET system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2018, the STEM Partnerships Forum, led by Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, recommended a lifelong unique student identifier be established and implemented across all education sectors by 2020. The forum summarised that the lack of a consistent national identifier was the largest barrier to understanding the impact of policy efforts to improve engagement in STEM education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final report of the Higher Education Standards Panel into improving retention, completion and success in higher education, released in 2018, included a recommendation to 'establish a common student identifier to better understand student pathways across tertiary education.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With over 10 million VET USIs created and 6,000 students accessing the system every day, we are building on a system that works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have now reached the next phase of this evolution, as we introduce USIs to all higher education students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 of the Bill outlines amendments to reflect consistency between vocational education and training and the higher education sector. This will ensure that both sectors are able to provide students with the best services possible to enrich their tertiary education journey. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time, all students studying at a tertiary level, will have access to the same national system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With almost all students in tertiary education using the USI, we will be able to monitor and collect unprecedented data to better inform education programs and policies. As with all information that is maintained by government, privacy is our number one priority. USIs are kept in a secure environment, with all necessary steps taken to protect identifiers from misuse, interference, unauthorised access and modification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through the USI, students will be able to move between VET and higher education in a manner that supports lifelong learning, personal development and career aspiration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in this Bill were designed with innovation, fairness, and longevity at their core. They were informed by a collaborative approach between stakeholders and government agencies, with a focus on ensuring the students of today and tomorrow have access to the best quality tertiary education.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I'm delighted to make a contribution on the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019. Before doing so, I'm grateful to see Senator Ciccone here, who, just before question time and some other business in the Senate today, was reflecting on the quality and the wonderful wines that are produced in his home state of Victoria. It's also great that Senators Duniam and Brockman are in the chamber as well, because they herald from great wine states also—Tasmania, in Senator Duniam's case, and Western Australia, my home state, in the case of Senator Brockman. I think what differentiates Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia is not just that they produce wine but that they produce premium quality wines, which really have been able to showcase the strength of Australian agriculture not just here in Australia but internationally. I'll come to these remarks in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that, in the last few years, lots of attention has been given to the sale of Australian produce to China. Senator Birmingham, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, is today—this very day—and over the next few days in India supporting Australian trade opportunities. Of course, an important element of those is agriculture. An important subset of those agricultural opportunities is Australia's wine industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the record, I think it's important, Senator Ciccone, that I let the Senate know what some of those great wine houses of Western Australia are. I see Senator Fawcett nodding in furious agreement. I know that he's a South Australian, but I'm sure he's tasted a few Western Australian wines in his time. I applaud the wonderful work that wine cellar doors like Vasse Felix in Western Australia, like Stormflower, like Voyager Estate, like Cullen Wines and like others do not just in providing employment opportunities for those working in the wine industry but in recognising just how important wine production is for the strength of regional economies in Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia. This is a point that, I think, is too often overlooked. When we think about the strength of the Margaret River region, the Peel region and other regions in our home state of Western Australia, we can't go past the fact that the strength of those regional economies is in part due to the consistency of the quality of wine production and the fact that these wine houses are so well managed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the debate that we had not such a long time ago, prior to the last election and in the term of the last government, there was quite an important debate that we had with regard to wine equalisation tax reform. Much of that was absolutely about the financial viability of wine producers in our country. Importantly, I think the element of the debate that informed and carried the government's position was when wine producers were able to talk about the importance of what the government does to assist wine production and, therefore, the importance that this brings to regional economies. That was a very, very important part of the debate that we had with regard to wine equalisation tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very interesting times for Australia's trade opportunities. Clearly the coronavirus is presenting some challenges, but at all times in this place we should be thinking about how we can continue to support those agricultural export industries that are doing well for our country, as well as thinking about what we can continue to do to continue to diversify those export opportunities for Australian producers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the substance of the matter, in 2017-18 Australia produced 1.7 million tonnes of wine grapes, consumed 492 million litres of wine and exported 866 million litres of wine. Australia's consumption of wine has been described as 19.7 litres per person in Australia, which equates to about 26 average bottles of wine per person per year. However, this is inclusive of the whole population, so the average for those of legal drinking age would be substantially larger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world and the fifth-largest wine exporter, with two-thirds of Australian wine exported, adding $2.89 billion to the Australian economy annually. The Morrison government is clearly committed to continuing to grow the Australian wine industry and all the benefits that accrue to this important part of our agricultural economy. We are delivering over $50 million worth of initiatives to grow Australia's wine exports and wine tourism in key markets, including targeted marketing campaigns in China and the United States of America and, importantly, capability development programs for our producers, wine export and international wine tourism grants, and a brand proposition and go-to-market strategy for Australian craft cider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's free trade agreements are delivering opportunities for Australian wine producers as well. An example of this is the recent Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or the CPTPP. Prior to the CPTPP, Australian wines exported to Mexico suffered a tariff of 20 per cent, competing against European Union, United States and Chilean wines, which have no tariffs. Since the announcement of the CPTPP, tariffs for high-quality wine have already fallen to a 6.6 per cent tariff and will fall to zero this year. That speaks of opportunity layered upon opportunity layered upon opportunity for wine producers and the economy that supports them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will provide a better competitive arrangement for Australian wine exporters in one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies. And the Morrison government is supporting the growth of Australian-grown wines and encouraging wine tourism in the Australian market through our $10 million per year Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grants program, which provides an annual grant of up to $100,000 for eligible wine producers in addition to the $350,000 available under the wine equalisation tax rebate scheme. And because Senator Duniam, from Tasmania, is the Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism and other matters, I want to put in a big plug. Senator Duniam, I wrote to you very recently arguing for some further reforms to cellar door grants that will not only support the Australian wine industry but also, as I've said before, support the regional economies in states like Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read into the record a statement that was made by the previous Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Senator Anne Ruston—again, from South Australia—when she announced the important wine equalisation tax reforms that were shepherded through the parliament by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Turnbull government. These are important, because it is a very powerful sign—both a symbolic sign and a very powerful financial incentive that continued to motivate wine producers so that they could continue to export to those big nations like India, China and the United States and to Latin America. Her statement demonstrates, again, that the coalition government is not just interested in sporadic initiatives to support Australia's wine industry but is working to a cohesive and comprehensive plan. In the statement of December 2016, commenting on the coalition government's soon to be introduced enhancements to the wine equalisation tax rebate, Senator Ruston said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms come on the back of extensive consultation with the wine industry. The reforms are the result of industry calling for action to support our great Australian wine industry by addressing distortions in the market through the misuse and exploitation of the WET Rebate scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following a national consultation program with the wine industry as announced in the 2016 Budget, and led by Ministers Kelly O'Dwyer and Anne Ruston, we are pleased to announce key changes to the Government’s eligibility criteria to protect the integrity of the WET Rebate scheme …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those integrity measures had three elements. Firstly, eligible producers must own 85 per cent of the grapes that the crusher used to make the wine and maintain ownership throughout the winemaking process. Secondly, the rebate was to be limited to branded, packaged wine in a container not exceeding five litres and branded with a registered trademark for domestic retail sale. Finally, the rebate claims must be better linked to the WET being paid. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those new eligibility criteria came into effect from 1 July 2018. The rebate cap was also reduced from $500,000 to $350,000 effective from 1 July 2018, which was a year later than the original plan, but a demonstration that the government was able to and did listen to consultation from the industry. It was a higher cap than the one announced in the 2016 budget. The December 2016 statement said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To encourage more wine tourism up to a further $100,000 per annum will be made available to producers who exceed the rebate cap through a new Wine Tourism and Cellar Door grant. Again the Government wants to back producers who add value and vibrancy to regional communities by encouraging visitors to wine regions. The eligibility criteria to qualify for the new grant will be finalised following consultation with the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were very important reforms. As Senator Ruston said in that media statement, they were the product of quite detailed, intense consultation processes. I want to applaud the quality wine industry in Western Australia and certainly in our home state, Senator Brockman, wines of Western Australia for the diligent work they did in making sure that the evidence was there to support these reforms. They are to be commended for their continued great stewardship of the Western Australia wine industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this bill addresses concerns raised directly by the Australian wine industry after a number of instances of counterfeit Australian wine showing up in export markets, including 14,000 of fake Penfolds wine that was seized by Chinese police in Shanghai in 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An important element of this bill is that it is supported by the industry. Tony Battaglene, chief executive of the organisation Australian Grape and Wine, had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… as Australia's fine-wine reputation has grown, so has the risk of fraud through intellectual property theft or passing-off. Australian wine business owners have needed to take additional steps to protect their brands and intellectual property in overseas markets, and increasingly, to invest in protection in Australia as well. This protection is costly and time-consuming for businesses, but the potential for damage to Australia's wine brand overseas means this action is necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We commend the Minister for Agriculture, Senator the Hon. Bridget McKenzie, for backing Australia's wine businesses. We are delighted the Bill has been introduced and expect bipartisan support for this critical piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether that bipartisan support has been delivered upon we will see in the very near future in this chamber. But just as this bill addresses the concerns of the industry, I look forward to the government continuing to address and listen to the industry's views on a wide range of matters. As I alluded to before, I'm particularly keen for the government to pay attention to the industry's views about cellar-door rebate reform. In small and medium businesses, reducing uncertainty, particularly around cash flow, is vital to ensure the business can operate and even more important when the business is looking to grow to take up domestic and, importantly, international export opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the current rebate is managed, individual wineries make an application to receive a grant, with the grant paid up to 12 months after the end of the financial year. These wineries, many of which are small to medium businesses, are required to pay the 29 per cent wine equalisation tax to the ATO within 30 days of the sale of the wine. Therefore, if the wine is sold in July it can be nearly two years before the rebate on the cellar-door sale is received by the business. As you can imagine, this is a significant cash flow issue that needs to be managed carefully, and I'm sure it is one that the government is sensitive to. This matter is exacerbated by the total grant rebates being limited to just $10 million. It is therefore impossible to be certain how much a winery business will receive back from the grant process. Indeed, in its first year of operation winery businesses only received approximately 63 per cent of the grants they were expecting to be reimbursed because of over-subscription. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as the government has improved small business cash flow with initiatives to ensure payment from the federal government faster, there's a significant opportunity here, in this space, to ensure that wineries can access their rebates faster, support the growth of their business, generate local employment opportunities and make the most of those very, very generous free trade agreements that the coalition government and the trade ministers have been shepherding through this parliament. Importantly, it will ensure that the scheme provides a guaranteed amount and a guaranteed time frame, so that business can produce their cash flow budgets— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise and speak on the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019, and I want to commend the contribution of my good friend Senator Dean Smith and, of course, the government more generally on the many ways that we are supporting this very important industry across Australia. This bill concerns important measures to better protect the integrity of our wine exports so as so prevent copycat operators improperly using wine producers' intellectual property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard and as we know, we have some of the very best wines in the world, and many of them are produced in my home state of Victoria. According to Wine Australia, Victoria is home to more regions and individual wineries than any other state in Australia. It also has the greatest diversity of regional and site climates, which allows for the production of virtually every imaginable wine style, from fine, sparkling wine, high-quality chardonnay and pinot noir, through to cabernet, shiraz and the fortified wines, which are particularly famous in the Rutherglen area. Of course, there are many famous winemaking regions in Victoria, including Beechworth, Mildura, the Pyrenees, the Yarra Valley and Gippsland—which is a fairly new area. In the home town where I am from, in the Geelong and Bellarine region, we have many wonderful vineyards, including Oakdean, Leura Park, Jack Rabbit, Clyde Park, Bannockburn, Austins, Terindah Estate—and the list goes on and on and on.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Di Natale, I will take the interjection. Do you want to add another winery that I've missed out?</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Blakes Estate. There is a very, very long list. In fact, in Victoria, would you believe, we have 499 cellar doors and 747 wineries producing 223 million litres, which is 17 per cent of the national production. That makes a $7.6 billion direct economic contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Dean Smith pointed out in his contribution, another essential point to note is the importance of our wine industry for regional communities—because, of course, it's not just about the growers; it's also about the supply chain. The supply chain includes the vineyards and the wineries but also the marketers, the brokers, the contract bottlers, freight and logistics operations, input suppliers in vineyard and winemaking, pruning and harvesting contractors, retailers and professional advisers—so right the whole way through, whether it is in agricultural production, viticulture, business management or tourism. So this is a really important industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just add that when I was a reporter with the ABC many years ago I had the great joy of working for a short time on a program called <span style="font-style:italic;">Holiday</span>, where we would travel the country trying out different wines. I have to say that the Victorian wines are the best—but that might be a point that might be contended by some of my colleagues here in the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world and the fifth-largest wine exporter. We now export two-thirds of all wine produced, which is an amazing figure in itself, adding $2.89 billion to the economy per year. As at September 2019, Australian wine exports to China, including Hong Kong and Macau, reached a record value of $1.25 billion, an increase of 18 per cent. That, to a large degree, has been underpinned by the work of our free trade agreements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, eliminated the existing tariffs on wine of 14 to 20 per cent. They are completely gone now. They went as of 1 January 2019. Our free trade agreements are playing a very significant role in the success of our wine industry, with the total value of Australian wine exports increasing by seven per cent in value to the $2.89 billion mark. The China market occupies a very large proportion of this export figure. This is incredible growth, which, of course, presents wonderful opportunities for our grapegrowers and our wine producers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The continuing success of Australian wine exports depends on the maintenance of our internationally recognised reputation for quality and integrity, and that is supported by Wine Australia's regulatory activities. The Australian wine industry, represented by Australian Grape and Wine Incorporated, came to the government, asking for stronger regulatory controls to deter the export of copycat wine from Australia. Copycat wine and other grape product exports are products that are exported from Australia with labels which seek to mimic elements of Australian brands for commercial gain and unfairly benefit from the reputation of those brands. A label directory was proposed by the industry as a useful way to assist brand owners to protect their intellectual property rights and, of course, by extension, the reputation of Australian wine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The really important element of the concerns raised by the industry is that our government listened. We listened to the industry, to the businesses right across this nation, and we are now taking action to better protect this important industry, to ensure that we back these businesses in—because it's tough yakka. If you consider what the wine growers in the bushfire impacted regions of South Australia, Victoria and NSW have had to deal with, their businesses have been hit for six. It is really tough, and it can be particularly tough and unpredictable in agriculture. So, whenever agricultural businesses reach out for support, we are there, the government is there, to listen and to ensure that our reputation as a pre-eminent exporter of agricultural produce is second to none. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will enable a label directory to be established as part of Wine Australia's export controls. It's a very important deterrent to exporters of wine and other great products who seek to unfairly benefit from the reputation of Australian brands. The label directory will provide brand owners with a searchable database of images of labels that can be used to find labels that potentially infringe their intellectual property rights and enable them to undertake civil action against copycat exporters through the Australian legal system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also enable Wine Australia to use the label directory in administering licences to export under the Wine Australia Regulations 2018. For instance, Wine Australia can use the images of the labels submitted to it to confirm that wine exporters are complying with their obligations under the Label Integrity Program, which is set out in the act. Of course, this could also be used as evidence of copycat labelling, and that will assist Wine Australia's ongoing assessment as to whether a wine exporter can be considered a fit and proper person who may hold a licence to export wine from Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important aspect of the bill is that the amendments to the Wine Australia Act 2013 made by the bill will enable Wine Australia to impose additional requirements on wine exporters as a condition of approval to export grape products from Australia. The bill allows for regulations to be made that would result in a whole lot of additional protections. This is really important because our reputation as a clean and green producer of first-class agricultural produce is incredibly precious to us as a nation. This is a very important measure in protecting the integrity of a vitally important industry. The label directory will provide additional protection, but, as I say, it also demonstrates that our government is continuing to listen to small business and that is very, very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure that when our businesses go out on the world stage they have every competitive advantage so that they can showcase their produce at its very, very best. I might say, as a former intellectual property lawyer myself, I recognise how important the protection of one's intellectual property is, whether it's designs, whether it's fashion, whether it's software or, in this case, whether it's the integrity of our wine that we produce in Australia. It is incredibly important to do everything we can to protect the integrity of our produce, including our agricultural produce. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise and conclude the debate on this bill, the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019. In doing so, I want to be bold: I'd like to say that every state and territory in Australia produces the best wine in Australia! We're going to spread the love around and acknowledge that this country produces the best wine. We have a resilient industry, one that works hard with all the challenges that are thrown up to it. I look forward to constructive discussions with all parties around the challenges that this industry faces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge the efforts of the former minister for agriculture, Bridget McKenzie, in coming up with this bill and working with industry assiduously to ensure that its needs have been heard and met through this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the bill, the wine export label directory, as being debated at present, can be established by Wine Australia through the passing of this legislation to assist brand owners in this country to protect their intellectual property rights, which, as we've heard constantly throughout this debate, are incredibly important when it comes to the investment made by estate owners and those employed within the industry. By supporting brand owners to better protect their intellectual property rights this bill will ensure consumers can be confident that they will be getting a safe and quality product and that what it says on the label on the bottle is what they're actually going to get. This additional control will assist in safeguarding the reputation of Australia's growing wine export market that directly employs over 69,000 Australians and is worth nearly $3 billion—$2.91 billion—per year to the economy, which is a tremendous input, largely in regional economies across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The label directory will be a public-facing, online database of all Australian wine labels for export that can be used by wine brand owners to search for copycat labels out there in the marketplace. Industry asked for a label directory to better protect their intellectual property rights from potential copycat exporters who seek to take advantage of the good name of Australian brands overseas—again, examples of which we have heard multiple times in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Wine Australia's role doesn't extend to regulating intellectual property rights, this bill will assist wine brand owners to better protect their own interests, which, as already discussed, is exactly what industry have been asking for. With the Wine Australia Amendment (Label Directory) Bill 2019 we are adding one more tool to Wine Australia's export controls toolkit. The bill will make maintaining the label directory part of Wine Australia's existing export controls to deter exporters of wine and other grape products who seek to mimic Australian brands for commercial gain. This bill is important to Australia's wine exporters as well as the wine industry more broadly. It ensures that Wine Australia is equipped with appropriate regulatory mechanisms for maintaining Australia's reputation for quality and integrity in a growing international market for Australian wine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter of smoke taint and the impact on wine grapes was canvassed extensively, and it is safe to say that this industry, like many others in this country, did not escape the ravages of the bushfires. Fires across the country have impacted on vineyards, on wineries, on genetic stock and on plant equipment right throughout our wine regions. Around 1,500 hectares of vineyards have fallen within the current fire affected regions, which is roughly one per cent of Australia's vineyards. The Australian government is supporting those small cellar door businesses and winegrape growers to get back to business quickly with the grants of up to $50,000 and $75,000 respectively. These small business and primary producer grants are already paying out, helping to replace burnt trellising and melted irrigation pipes and helping with the heartbreaking cleanout of burnt vines, which we have heard about during this debate. What a terrible impact that has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Australian wine industry is a key drawcard for regional tourism—something that I'm very passionate about—which has also taken a hit over summer. A wine tour through our regional cellar doors is a highlight for both domestic and international tourists who come to taste our quality wines in our beautiful bush. We've of course got the Australian government's $76 million tourism marketing push—the money that's being invested in international marketing, partnering up with private entities, airlines, and our major hotel chains—and $20 million for our Holiday Here This Year campaign, where we are partnering with states and territories to encourage Australians to do just that: take a trip through our beautiful wine-growing districts and spend time and money to support these small to medium businesses and of course, keep these people employing locals in their community, which is so critically important to regional economies. Wine tourism is a critically important part of our regional tourism industry, and it is something that this bill and other measures being taken by this government go a long way to support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the reports of smoke reaching vines far from fire fronts, this season's bushfires have highlighted the real anxiety and threat smoke brings to Australian vineyards. Smoke from bushfires, prescribed burns and farm burn-offs carries a risk that winegrapes may be affected by the free volatile phenols that are produced when wood is burned. However, research has shown that, just because smoke may be visible or able to be smelt, it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a high risk of smoke affecting the grapes. Grapes at a certain point of ripening which are exposed to smoke of a particular age and composition can produce aromas in wine which may be offensive to some wine consumers. This resulting smoke taint has long been an issue of concern for the industry, and it's a problem that's unique to the wine industry. Smoke taint can result in downgrades of fruit and the resultant wine and in losses and unharvested fruit, so it's important to the wine and winegrape industry to have the best means to measure, manage and mitigate smoke taint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into government in 2013, the government has invested nearly $79 million in matched funding for the Australian wine industry's research and development priorities through Wine Australia. Additionally, for smoke taint specifically, the government has provided $1.466 million in funding for research projects through the Rural Research and Development for Profit program, matched by research partners in Victoria. This smoke research project has been generating knowledge, innovative technologies and processes that directly benefit grapegrowers and winemakers. Findings from the project are already being implemented through the Australian Wine Research Institute's extension services. The program includes face-to-face workshops and webinars for grapegrowers and winemakers on how to manage fire damage and smoke taint and is going to be delivered by the Australian Wine Research Institute in consultation with regional wine associations and major winemakers. Workshops have already been held in the Adelaide Hills and the Hunter Valley, Canberra, Orange, Mudgee, Milawa, Tumbarumba, Griffith, the Yarra Valley, Mornington Peninsula and the Barossa Valley, with more than 1,000 wine industry participants, funded by the government through Wine Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we have a local example in Tasmania. Only a couple of weeks ago, I visited Hartzview vineyards which was impacted by the fires in the summer of 2018-19, just south of Hobart in the Huon Valley. I met with the proprietors there and talked with them about what they were doing to manage the smoke taint that impacted on their vineyard. They've been partnering with La Trobe University and looking at innovative ways to deal with fruit that was impacted by smoke, and they are sharing with others in the industry in that region the learnings they've taken from the work they've done with the La Trobe University. There are some very exciting things coming out of it. Obviously it's always better to avoid it, but these tools that they are going to be provided with for dealing with smoke taint, I think, give us cause for hope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, winemaking is a long process, and any smoke taint in this year's crop won't be in the wine coming onto the market in the near future. In the meantime, Australia's agriculture counsellors are working alongside Wine Australia to facilitate provision of accurate information in wine export markets about the impacts of the bushfires and to provide assurance of the continuing high quality of Australian wine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just going to the second reading amendment that's been proposed by the opposition and that was moved by Senator Sterle earlier on, I believe the Australian government has an extensive agenda and has made a significant investment in climate resilience and adaptation. Our resilience and adaptation investments produce practical actions that will keep Australians safe and prepared for the future. The government is taking the impacts of a changing climate on the wine industry seriously. The Australian government has provided more than $78.9 million, as I've already mentioned, in matched funding since November 2013 for the wine industry's R&amp;D priorities through our entity Wine Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wine companies across Australia are implementing measures to mitigate the potential impact of the changing climate on their industry, because it's economic to do so. Examples exist in the area of water-saving techniques, the use of alternative packaging like glass and PET bottles, reducing refrigeration loads and, of course, extra planting of trees, which act as carbon sinks. The wine industry's use of nitrogen fertiliser, which can create the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide when added to soil, is very tactical and targeted and contributes very little to the overall nitrous oxide emissions levels. But the future impacts of climate change on the wine sector may not be as dramatic as has been described by some. A four-year study in shiraz vineyards around Mildura in 2018 suggests that, for that region at least, increased temperatures and levels of CO2 do not have a significant impact on grape yield or quality. This and many other research projects were completed with funding from the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, through Wine Australia, is investing $5.4 million over the next three years in climate change adaptation and mitigation research and development projects. Wine Australia has also successfully completed a number of research projects to improve the wine industry's climate resilience, such as developing irrigation strategies and understanding the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide on wine grapes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, for smoke taint specifically, as I've already mentioned, the government has provided nearly $1½ million in funding to a research project through the Rural Research and Development for Profit program, matched by research partners in Victoria. This smoke research project has been generating knowledge and innovative technologies and processes to directly benefit grapegrowers and winemakers, and the findings of these projects are already being implemented right throughout the industry. Investing in this vital research will provide the wine industry with the tools they need to grapple with a changing and more variable climate and increasing severe weather events such as drought and bushfires. So we oppose the second reading amendment but do indeed commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

Labor won't oppose the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, more broadly, this is just another tweak to a sector that requires a genuine reform package. On its watch, this government has trashed our vocational system. It has slashed funding to TAFE and training, let apprentice numbers fall and presided over a national shortage of tradies, apprentices and trainees. Those opposite simply refuse to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls the vocational training sector. More than six years of Liberal government has left Australia facing a crisis in skills and vocational training. If the Liberals and Nationals don't do something serious to look at the skills crisis they've created, we could be looking at the extinction of the Australian tradie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this third-term Liberal-National government there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees and a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. There are more people dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than finishing them. There is a nearly 10 per cent increase in the number of occupations facing skills shortages, and, in the face of that, the Liberals and Nationals have slashed $3 billion from TAFE and training. The Liberal-National government doesn't care enough or have the capacity to do the hard work that needs to be done to build a better post-school system. Fiddling at the edges of the current system will not address the profound problems that undermine vocational education and training and consequently the productive performance and international competitiveness of our economy. Unlike Labor, the government does not understand the critical role of TAFE as the public provider, the value in skills and apprenticeships, or the value of the hardworking and passionate public TAFE teachers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of overzealous application of competition policy and privatisation in the VET sector, coupled with chronic underfunding, has had devastating effects on the sector. Too often we have seen dodgy providers overload with students for a quick profit then go belly up leaving those students out of pocket and without the qualifications they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has it taken this government so long to act? Unlike those who sit opposite us, we value the role of an appropriately funded VET sector for the training, skills and apprenticeships they provide to so many Australians and its vital role in driving the economy and enhancing industry. So, while we won't oppose this bill, we do call on the government to stop ignoring the skills and vocational training crisis that we're experiencing in Australia and to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls this important sector.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019, which supports Australia's apprentices and the tradies of our future. I acknowledge the hard work of Senator Cash, who is working to raise the profile of the vocational education and training sector to ensure that it becomes a viable option for many students leaving high school. This is vitally important as we face the challenges of new and emerging industries as well as the evolution of the more traditional trades that the vocational training sector has worked with for many years. As new industries emerge and the more traditional trades become more technologically sophisticated, vocational careers are often a much better job path than university for many young people. Also a vital way to tackle youth unemployment is to give young people the relevant skills for the changing workforce and to make available vocational training and courses that best suit their abilities and interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the Morrison government is investing over $3 billion in 2019-20 to ensure that the VET system delivers the right skills for Australia's workforce of today and tomorrow. This funding includes a range of measures that not only directly support young people in the VET sector but also encourage employers to take on apprentices and trainees. This support comprises $1.1 billion to fund the government's own skills programs, including employer incentives and support for Australian Apprenticeships; $1.5 billion given to the states and territories every year through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development specific purpose payment; and $175 million given to states and territories via the Skilling Australians Fund to support increased apprenticeship and traineeship numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Victoria, the coalition government will provide around $1.6 billion over four years through the special purpose payment to support skills development. The Australian government also provides funding directly to Victorian employers to hire apprentices. I'm pleased to say that this includes the $98 million that was paid to employers in 2018-19 under the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program and the $62.3 million that was paid to apprentices under the Trade Support Loans program. As at December 2019, 2,000 apprentices in Victoria are expected to attract the new additional identified skills shortage payment for their employer and 3,027 had commenced in an eligible occupation. In 2018, there were 21,453 Victorian enrolments in VET student loan courses, with loans of almost $102 million. Through the Australian Apprentice Wage Subsidy trial we're also supporting over 3,200 employers across regional Australia to engage more Australian apprentices in areas of skill needs. Victoria was allocated a total of 662 places over the two phases of the trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2019-20 budget committed $50.6 million over four years to trial industry training hubs in 10 regions with high youth unemployment, including Shepparton in Victoria. The Australian government provides $1.5 billion every year to state and territory governments under the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development specific purpose payment. Funding from the Commonwealth to the Victorian government under this agreement has been steadily increasing—from around $338 million in 2011-12 to an expected $428 million in 2022-23. Overall, the Commonwealth is investing over $3 billion in 2019-20 to ensure that the VET system delivers the right skills for Australia's workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has already implemented policies to support people undertaking apprenticeships and to take on apprentices. Our Skilling Australians Fund will create more apprenticeships to support future productivity, jobs and growth. Over $330 million has been provided to state and territory governments, supporting approximately 80,000 apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. They target occupations with skills shortages through incentive payments for employers and apprentices. We are investing $50.6 million to trial 10 local industry training hubs in areas of high youth unemployment to ensure that vocational education programs are tailored to meet local workforce needs and skills demands. The hubs aim to improve opportunities for young people in regions with high youth unemployment, specifically targeting Year 11 and 12 students. Each training hub will be managed by a full-time career facilitator, providing an on-the-ground presence while delivering training hub services. I'm very pleased to hear that from January 2021 a training hub will be located in the rural town of Shepparton in my home state of Victoria. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support Australian apprentices to meet everyday costs while they undertake their training, eligible apprentices will be able to apply for trade support loans. The coalition government introduced these loans in July 2014 to help apprentices successfully complete their apprenticeship. The loans provide around $21,000 over four years to eligible apprentices to assist them with the costs of living and learning while undertaking their training. Similar to a HECS-HELP loan, loans will not have to be repaid until the apprentice is earning an income above the minimum repayment threshold. This threshold was around $45,000 in 2019-20. In order to maintain the real value of the loans, the loan amount will be indexed according to the CPI. Apprentices who successfully complete their apprenticeship will receive a 20 per cent discount on their loan amount. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade support loans are by far the best loan any apprentice will receive. It is better than a commercial loan and it demonstrates the importance the coalition government is placing on ensuring that our budding tradies are well supported to complete their apprenticeship. During the 2018-19 financial year the Trade Support Loans program provided financial support to around 56,000 Australians apprentices. While in receipt of the loan, apprentices must notify their provider of any change in their circumstances which may impact their eligibility—for example, if their apprenticeship is suspended or they change employers. Where a loan instalment payment is made and the apprentice has not notified their provider of the change, the apprentice may incur an overpayment debt to the Commonwealth, which needs to be repaid immediately. The bill will allow offsetting arrangements to be implemented where the apprentice is eligible to receive loan instalments in the future. Future instalments are reduced by the loan instalments amount already received in error until the debt is fully remedied. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While in receipt of the loan, apprentices are also required to inform the secretary of the department if their address or circumstances change. Currently apprentices must notify a change of address within 14 days. This bill allows notification to occur after 14 days. Currently apprentices must notify the change of circumstance within seven days. This bill allows notification to occur within 14 days. These changes, importantly, will reduce the administrative burden on apprentices and providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is committed to ensuring that we are equipping Australians with the skills they need for good, secure jobs. We are committed to ensuring that the economy is managed in such a way that these programs are affordable, effective and targeted to help those take advantage of a modern and growing economy—something Labor could never, ever achieve. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  I'm very happy to have it, and thank you for that assistance, Madam Acting Deputy President Polley. Labor will support the bill that's in front of the Senate, but I observe that the vocational education system has collapsed under the coalition.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apprentices are extremely low-paid. Access to financial support like this actually really matters. Take, for an example, an apprentice boilermaker under the manufacturing and associated industries award. The award rate for a first-year boilermaker apprentice is $12.48 an hour—65 per cent of the minimum wage. In their second year it's $14.75 an hour, and in their third year it's $17.02 an hour. Being trade qualified really matters. It's worth the investment. As somebody who has represented skilled tradespeople my whole working life, I can tell you that these are really good jobs. But almost half of all apprentices drop out before they get their trade, and the low rate of apprentice pay is one of the main reasons that people drop out. If you have to choose between getting a trade and putting food on the table, that makes life very difficult for young apprentices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apprentices are also vulnerable, more vulnerable than most people in the community, to wage theft. Australians have followed what has happened particularly in the hospitality industry: George Calombaris, $7.8 million in unpaid wages; Heston Blumenthal, $4 million in unpaid wages; Neil Perry, an estimated $10 million in unpaid wages, with timesheets tampered with and changed. The workers who bore the brunt of this theft weren't lawyers, politicians or journalists; they were apprentice chefs—people at the lowest end of the labour market and some of the lowest paid.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research from the University of Queensland shows that this exploitation in the hospitality industry is institutionalised. It found that unpaid penalty rates and unpaid superannuation—which I understand, following today's Senate debate, we're giving people an amnesty for—were rife and institutionalised. A first-year apprentice chef being paid award wages makes $474.38 a week. Being underpaid at such a low salary is devastating for young workers. There must be substantial action to increase the pay of apprentices across the board. I want to commend the work of trade unions, who are doing that work. There will always be a need to cover the upfront costs of starting an apprenticeship. That's why we supported the original trade support legislation, and that's why we'll support the legislation here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original trade support loans system was a product of the 2014 budget. I think we all remember the 2014 budget. It provided $2.7 million in funding for the original loan program and cut the Tools for Your Trade program, which represented $1,914 million straight out of the pockets of Australian apprentices. The original Tools for Your Trade program provided $800 in cash. It was a Howard government program, which was expanded by Labor in government, where it was increased substantially to $5,500 over the course of the apprenticeship, including a $1,500 bonus on completion. Labor did that because we're a party that recognises the real value of skilled trades. It's Labor that built the TAFE system around the country, and it's Labor who's going to have to defend it. The Abbott government axed the Tools for Your Trade initiative. The then industry minister—we've had five industry ministers over the course of this government, and no industry policy—Ian Macfarlane, said, 'We've got evidence that they're spending the money on tattoos and mag wheels for their cars, and birthday parties.' That's where the coalition government has come from on these schemes. What an insult to hardworking, low-paid apprentices right at the bottom of the labour market trying to find their path to a decent life or adults who are changing their career, mid-career, who often take a pay cut to retrain. The coalition government has taken every opportunity to make their lives harder, their prospects of completing their apprenticeship more remote and the prospects of getting good jobs in decent industries that pay a decent wage almost impossible in some regional communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite love to dress up in high-vis—we saw a bit of that today. They love to pretend that they've ever done anything with their hands. I've been listening with great interest to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weatherboard and Iron</span> podcasts of some of the National Party members, who you can almost see from here, but not quite. These people have never struggled to put food on the table on an apprentice wage. People who talk about weatherboard and iron have rarely lived in one of those homes, and they've rarely met anybody who has. All they know is about the sharp suits and the soft chairs in executive life. They don't know the smell of a workshop or the sounds of machines, and they certainly don't know what it takes to run an economy and run a labour market that produces good jobs and a reasonable prospect of a young apprentice coming out of their trade and going into a decent job. We heard a lot today about the increases in jobs. What we haven't heard much about today is good jobs, decent jobs and trade jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In truth, there are 150,000 fewer apprentices every year in this country because the team opposite have mismanaged the economy and mismanaged TAFE. There are now fewer Australians in training than there were a decade ago. That's 150,000 lost opportunities for our kids to have a better life; 150,000 opportunities for people to retrain gone; 150,000 opportunities for decent businesses to invest in their future workforce capability gone; and 150,000 apprenticeships and traineeships that the country needs for a more productive economy and for a better economic future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've talked to thousands of tradies over the course of my working life—fitters, machinists, boilermakers, electricians, auto mechanics, sheet-metal workers, aerospace engineers—who are deeply worried that their kids will not have the same opportunities that they have had. They're not actors pretending to be tradespeople wearing the high-vis. I've worked with hundreds of businesses, large and small, that can't afford to let their tradespeople retire because they don't have the workers to replace them. Across the country our TAFEs—mismanaged—are emptying out from deliberate mismanagement. As we face the key challenges of the 21st century, dealing with a more unstable global environment, the re-industrialisation of our economy to avoid climate change, the social and technological challenges of the future of work, we do so without 150,000 extra skilled workers who could have helped the country to build its response.</span>

The advertising executive hired an actor to paper over the fact that there is no decent policy from this government, either in the labour market, to create good jobs, or in vocational education or training, to deliver decent jobs and decent apprenticeships for ordinary Australians in the regions. Hiring a television personality to save this government's record on vocational education is like trying to weld with a hairdryer. It might work on the whiteboard when you're doing the marketing exercise, but it will never deliver one extra job in regional New South Wales, one extra job in suburban Brisbane or country Brisbane, or one extra job in Dandenong or Shepparton. It will deliver advertising messages—focus grouped to within an inch of their lives—designed to prop up a government that's lost the capacity to have an agenda for the future of Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> reports that the government is paying Mr Cam $345,000 for 15 months—11 times the wage for a first-year apprentice chef. Minister Cash didn't want you to know that. She put in a very good effort trying to make his salary commercial in confidence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a serious effort from government to recruit and retain young Australians as apprentices. We have to rebuild our skills system. The government should start by retaining the apprentices and trainees who have already started their apprenticeships. Only 56.7 per cent of apprentices and trainees complete their courses, and that figure is going down. This means that over 43 per cent of apprentices and trainees drop out before they are qualified. That is a huge cost to business and a huge cost to the government. More importantly, it is huge lost opportunities for thousands of young women and men whom our system is letting down.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number one reason cited by apprentices and trainees who left was, for many of them, workplace culture. Of women who dropped out, 44.7 per cent reported being bullied at work. Another reason that young apprentices cited was pay and working conditions—</span>

                    </a>  That is beneath you, Senator Scarr. It is actually a deeper cultural problem, across all workplaces: it is about valuing younger workers and looking after people; it is about building a culture at work where people are treated with respect and are paid decently and know they've got a future; it is about the institutions representing them having a say at work; and it is about people being valued for the work that they do. This is serious stuff that actually matters in ordinary workplaces and we ought to take those issues seriously.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issues that drive big apprentice drop-outs are, of course, about pay and working conditions. If most apprentices live below the poverty line, they will continue to drop out in large numbers. It takes until the fourth year of an apprenticeship to be paid above the minimum wage. If young people can earn substantially more bagging groceries or working in a call centre, they will continue to drop out of apprenticeships. We need to recruit more apprentices and support more women into apprenticeships. Many trades, particularly the construction industry, represent some of the most gender-segregated workplaces in the country. For example, only 2½ per cent of automotive tradespeople are women. A University of Sydney study shows that only 50 per cent of automotive tradespeople would describe their workplaces as environments where men and women are treated equally. Other trades have dramatic under-representation of women. They include electricians, telecommunication trades, construction trades, metal fabrication and plumbing. These figures have remained stagnant and have not moved for three decades. As a country, we need to deal with industry policy that creates good jobs and that doesn't send good jobs, in particular good manufacturing jobs, overseas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many other areas of policy, the government doesn't have a plan for our skill system beyond advertising campaigns, hiring actors, putting the hi-vis on and doing press conferences. It's important that we improve the system of trade support loans. This is not the first time I've stood up here supporting a piece of government legislation but opposing the way that the government has failed to deal with the sector properly. We will support this legislation, but it barely touches the surface of what we need to achieve for Australian workplaces and to deliver real apprenticeship and training opportunities for people particularly in our regions and in our suburbs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I rise tonight to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019. Apprenticeships and getting young Australians into trades is incredibly important for the future of our nation. Almost every aspect of our future depends, in a large part, on having a skilled workforce to help build this nation. Whether it's in the construction centre, building the infrastructure such as the homes and the offices that Australia needs in order to grow and expand; in the energy sector, which has so much opportunity for the future; or in the mining sector, which employs so many people around Australia and will continue to be a key industry and a major competitive advantage for Australia in the decades to come, apprentices are critical. The Morrison government has a strong plan to support them. That's why we took a very significant policy to the election to create more apprentices. I look forward to speaking about that policy here tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that I nominated to be considered for the Senate and the reason I ran as a Liberal candidate is I've seen too many young Tasmanians, people my age, having to leave our island state for job opportunities that they feel they can't have at home. These people don't want to have to leave, but they feel that they can't enjoy the employment opportunities in Tasmania that they could in other places. We, as a government, need to be making sure that there are opportunities for our young people in Australia more broadly but also in my island state—perhaps a little selfishly as a Tasmanian. I'm advocating very strongly that we should make sure there are job opportunities in my island state for our young people, and investing in the trades is a really important part of doing this. Not every young Australian wants to go to university. Not every young Australian wants to pursue a career that might require them to have a university degree, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. We should be encouraging as much choice for our young people as possible so that they have options for future study. I think investing in the trades is an incredibly important part of this. That's why I was so proud to stand as a candidate in the federal election last year and stand alongside my coalition counterparts and fight for these policies—part of which we are obviously discussing here in the chamber this evening—to make sure that Australians across the age spectrum, but particularly our young people, can have opportunities, whether that's higher education at universities or pursuing a trade. This piece of legislation here this evening is a really important part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking about the election policies that we were fighting for in May last year, the coalition had a $585 million Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package that will create more apprenticeships around the country. This means an additional 80,000 apprentice positions will be created over five years in occupations with skills shortages through incentive payments for employers and apprentices. We're establishing 10 national industry training hubs in areas of high youth unemployment to ensure vocational education meets local workforce needs. As part of this package employers and the new apprentices they hire in 10 national skill shortage occupations may be eligible for the additional identified skills shortage payment. This payment will deliver up to $4,000 in support to eligible employers and $2,000 to new apprentices. This is a really important new incentive to boost occupations with critical skills shortages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also established phase 2 of the Australian Apprentice Wage Subsidy trial, in July last year. That trial provides support to employers in the first three years of an Australian apprenticeship, offering 75 per cent of the first-year award wage, 50 per cent of the second-year award wage and 25 per cent of the third-year award wage. We are also lowering the age of eligibility for the Support for Adult Australian Apprentices incentive from 25 to 21 years for apprentices commencing from 1 July last year, and that gives employers more support when they seek to engage adult apprentices in areas of identified skills need. These are practical measures to support those who want to employ an apprentice and further incentivise those business owners who might be considering putting on an additional apprentice. Like I said, these policies are all about creating new opportunities and encouraging people to enter the trades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important skills initiative of the Morrison government in my own home state of Tasmania is the Energising Tasmania initiative, and this is something that I'm very excited about. This policy is an investment of $17 million, through Energising Tasmania, to develop a Tasmanian workforce with the priority skills needed to support the Battery of the Nation initiative and renewable energy and these related sectors. It is a really exciting partnership with the Tasmanian government to address critical training and skills development needs of high priority. I was with Minister Cash in the north-west of Tasmania with the then candidate for Braddon—now member for Braddon—Gavin Pearce, when we announced the funding for this commitment. It is a very exciting project. But the most important thing about Energising Tasmania is that government and industry are working together to identify what skills are going to be required. We know that Battery of the Nation is a very exciting new venture for Tasmania and we know that there will be opportunities to train and retrain people in the appropriate skills that they need if this project is going to be a success, so that's why the government has invested this $17 million through Energising Tasmania to make sure that our local workforce can keep up with the demand of this new and emerging industry, and I think that's very exciting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In talking about the fact that so many young people of my age have had to leave Tasmania—this Energising Tasmania, Battery of the Nation was not an opportunity that was around when I was finishing high school and considering my future career. I'm not sure I would have quite been cut out to build the Battery of the Nation myself, knowing that my practical skills are, perhaps, not quite up to scratch in that regard. But it is fantastic that these opportunities are here. It is about giving young people more choice and understanding of what those opportunities are for them to contribute to their local economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of Energising Tasmania is to remove the up-front costs associated with vocational education and training to lift barriers to training so more Tasmanians can train for the skills that local business and industry need. Fee-free training will be available in the priority areas identified by industry, including project management, civil construction, electro technology, resource management, building and construction, water industry operations and engineering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through our new training grants fund up to 2½ thousand fully subsidised training places will be provided over the next five years, including traineeships, apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships in areas of identified skills need. This is exactly what skills programs should be doing—identifying the growth industries in each state. We know in Tasmania that hydro and pumped hydro potential, along with other technology, is a growth area. Putting in place mechanisms to build the workforce that's needed to deliver on that potential, this initiative will contribute strongly to the aims of the Battery of the Nation project to achieve an affordable and reliable clean energy future for Tasmania and for the rest of the country. It will drive increased employment opportunities across Tasmania, including in regional areas with high unemployment. To that end, I'm sure the member for Braddon, Gavin Pearce, would agree with me that this is a such fantastic initiative for the north-west coast of Tasmania. This is an area that needs initiatives like this so that the young people there, and the locals there, can work locally if they want to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we're discussing here tonight is just another element of our commitment to supporting apprentices. The Australian government introduced the Trade Support Loans Scheme in July 2014 to help Australian apprentices successfully complete their apprenticeships. The loans provide just over $21,000 over four years to eligible apprentices to assist them with the costs of living and learning while undertaking their training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2018-19 financial year, the Trade Support Loans program provided financial support to 55,998 Australian apprentices. Arguably, those are 55,998 Australian apprentices who may not otherwise have been able to seek out an apprenticeship. The TSL debts are normally repaid through the Australian taxation system once a former apprentice's income reaches the minimum repayment income threshold. These payments are managed by the Australian Apprenticeship Support Network providers. While in receipt of Trade Support Loans, apprentices must notify their AASN provider of any change in their circumstances that may impact their eligibility for TSL—for example, if their apprenticeship is suspended or if they change employers. Where an instalment payment is made and the apprentice has not notified their AASN provider of the change, the apprentice may incur an overpayment debt to the Commonwealth, which needs to be repaid immediately. The amendment that we are discussing here today will allow offsetting arrangements to be implemented where the apprentice is eligible to receive TSL instalments in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this piece of legislation that we're discussing here tonight is just one of a whole suite of measures that the Morrison coalition government is putting in place to support industries, to support apprentices and to make sure that we have the skills that we need for the jobs of the future. The coalition government is committed to ensuring that Australians have the right skills for the workforce of today and tomorrow. Indeed, in 2019-20 we are investing over $3 billion in vocational education and training, which includes $1½ billion given to the states and territories every year through the National Agreement on Skills and Workforce Development; $1.1 billion to fund the government's own skills program, including employer incentives and support for apprentices; and just a little bit left over to the states and territories via the Skilling Australians Fund to support increased apprenticeships and traineeship numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also, of course, still paying to fix Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP scheme. Since 2016, over 66,500 students had VET FEE-HELP loan debts of over $1 billion re-credited by the Commonwealth. Under this disastrous scheme, dodgy providers flourished and student exploitation was high. Students were systematically exploited and signed up to accumulate huge debts for training packages that were never delivered. That's why we've introduced VET Student Loans—so that students can gain their qualifications safe in the knowledge that they will not be ripped off.  The government's skills package is contributing to an increase in Commonwealth funding to VET over the budget forward estimates. Funding from the Commonwealth to the states and territories under the national agreement has been steadily increasing from around $1.36 billion in 2011-12 to an expected $1.6 billion in 2022-23. The numbers speak for themselves. This government has a very firm commitment to ensure that our VET sector continues to flourish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in summarising what I've said here tonight, because I recognise that my time is not far from expiring, as a relatively new member of the coalition government—and I will still lay claim to being relatively new for maybe another six or so months—it is personally pleasing and satisfying for me to be here working in a government that is taking really seriously the issue of ensuring that young people can have access to the skills that they need for the jobs that they want to have. Coming from Tasmania, this issue is always so front and centre for me. I've seen so many of my friends and my family members leaving Tasmania—whether it is when they've finished high school, when they've finished university or a couple of years into their chosen career—because they feel that they can't have employment opportunities in Tasmania like they can on the mainland. I've always considered myself incredibly fortunate to have lived and worked in Tasmania all of my life, but I know that I'm one of the lucky ones. Most people haven't had the pleasure of doing that. Some of my friends now living interstate want to come back to Tasmania. They know we have a fantastic lifestyle in Tasmania and they want those opportunities there—not just for them to be able to come home to, but of course, for their children as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So policies such as the ones that I've talked about tonight, enabled through the legislation that we're debating here this evening, are such an important part of this government demonstrating to the Australian people its commitment to our next generation of workers—its commitment to ensuring that there are job opportunities there for the next generation and that, most importantly, they are appropriately skilled to go into those jobs and have a successful career. As I said at the start, for some people, that's going to university. I was one of those people, and there is nothing wrong with that, but at the same time we should still be concentrating much of our efforts on the trades, because, as I've set out here tonight in talking about everything that's happening in my home state of Tasmania, the trades have such an important role to play. What we really need to be doing, I believe, is making sure that our young people are aware of the trades and the potential career benefits that can come out of a pathway that they pursue through that. This policy, this legislation that we're discussing here this evening, is an important part of that. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I'm delighted to rise in support of the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019. Unlike those on the other side, we haven't walked away from the mining, farming, agriculture and forestry industries. There's no point in doing an apprenticeship if you haven't got a job to go to. If you want TAFE to flourish, you need to support these industries, not make promises on the never-never about having a zero carbon target in 2050, which is only going to smash the farming industry, the mining industry and the forestry industry. We're going to end up having our entire manufacturing industry going offshore. That is not what we want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to Senator Ayres, who talked about us being on the side of the suits: no-one loved suits more than Paul Keating. What a great job he did with the manufacturing industry, with the Button plan! He absolutely destroyed Victoria. Once the jewel in the crown, the manufacturing state of this country, it has now been destroyed thanks to Paul Keating and Bob Hawke and their neoliberal agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, I'm pleased to rise in support of the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019. It is an important step in ensuring that both the vocational education and training sector and apprenticeships are treated with the same importance, respect and focus as the university sector. It is particularly important that we do more to restore balance and sustainability to the higher education system. As a government and as a parliament, we must do all we reasonably can to encourage more Australians to take full advantage of vocational and trade training. It's a great pathway to a rewarding career and financial security. Apprenticeship data from last year shows that the number of apprenticeship opportunities is increasing. This is a positive sign, but there is more to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passing this bill will certainly strip much of the red tape from the current trade support loans, a worthwhile program, not dissimilar to HECS, which provides income-contingent loans to Australian apprentices in a range of occupations. This bill promises to make gaining and paying for a trade qualification that much easier. An apprentice receiving payments under the TSL program may incur an overpayment debt to the Commonwealth should their circumstances change. It is a strict requirement that any such overpayment be repaid immediately, often triggering a recovery process which is both frustrating and protracted for the Commonwealth and the apprentice alike. Changing circumstances under the program may include if a business shuts down, causing an apprentice to lose both their income and their TSL eligibility. It's easy to see how, in a situation like this, a young apprentice may forget to notify the Australian Apprenticeship Support Network within the required 14-day window. The introduction of a longer, more practical notice period is one of the measures in this bill designed to reduce the pressure on Australian apprentices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional amendments to the Trade Support Loans Act 2014 that form part of this bill include specific offsetting arrangements for apprentices who remain eligible for future TSL payments. These arrangements can be implemented relatively quickly and easily and allow for overpayments to be offset against future TSL instalments, while total TSL debt is transferred to the ATO and recovered through the taxation system. The alignment of notice periods for persons to respond and provide information under the act will help to further reduce the administrative burden for both the apprentice and the AASN provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government supports our apprentices and trainees in every possible way. Rather than treating those with a vocational education as second-class citizens, as many of the university educated urban elites now do, this government aims to do precisely the opposite. Only this Liberal-National government will ensure that Australia's vocational training and apprenticeship programs are administered and delivered with integrity, with value and in a financially sustainable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is clear. This is why during the last financial year we supported over 50,000 apprentices across Australia with the Trade Support Loans scheme alone. We know things can be tough and we want to ensure that our apprentices can manage while they focus on completing their training. This bill will significantly reduce the burden on our apprentices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should never forget that the largest decline in the number of apprenticeships in our nation's history occurred in 2012-13 under the last Labor government. Those opposite cut a whopping $1.2 billion from employer incentive programs to take on apprentices. This is Labor's record on apprenticeships. This was Labor's record when today's shadow Treasurer was the chief of staff of the then Treasurer and when Senator Wong and the member for Grayndler both had seats at the cabinet table. What did they do when not signing off on school halls, pink batts and the dismemberment of John Howard's border protection regime? I'll tell you what they did. They took a knife to the vocational training sector and they slashed it to blazes in a pathetic attempt to prop up a failed budget. And they have the gall to come into this chamber with mock virtue trickling from the corners of their mouths and claim to stand up for hardworking Australians. Well, the Australian people are on to them, and Australians won't be fooled a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast to the appalling failures of those opposite and in addition to the sensible measures announced in this bill, the Morrison government has expanded the wage subsidy trial for apprentices to create a further 80,000 places and has invested funds for a new skills shortage payment. However, government can only do so much. I'm confident that the Morrison government's significant investment in our vocational education sector will encourage parents and young people to appreciate what vocational training and apprenticeships can do for them. It is unfortunate that in recent decades we have seen a powerful urban culture slowly shift importance and esteem away from vocational education. Plumbers, carpenters, electricians and butchers all create and grow small businesses which drive our economy and create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate—no, it's worse than that; it's tragic—that in my home state of Queensland the Labor government is working so hard and so deliberately under state treasurer and de facto premier Jackie Trad to entrench this anti-trade sentiment. Only last May the Queensland Audit Office revealed that Queensland TAFE faces a significant financial risk due to declining student numbers. This revelation from the Queensland Audit Office is a direct result of the gross negligence and financial mismanagement of the Palaszczuk Labor government, a government which has spent millions on rebranding hospitals and giving handouts to senior bureaucrats, not to mention over $2 million spent on international travel in the last two years alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor will, of course, point to other essential government reforms in the vocational education space, including reforms to correct their own policy failures, such as the disastrous VET FEE-HELP program. We should never forget that VET FEE-HELP was yet another stroke of policy genius from the Labor Party, a policy that quickly turned to scam and only let dodgy operators prosper while leaving a trail of debt laden victims with virtually zero employment prospects in its wake. This is a rare Labor skill. Only Labor can design a scheme that costs countless millions of dollars and only makes the situation worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor don't only make a dog's breakfast of the VET sector by their direct mismanagement when in government; they also threaten to choke off the very reason for vocational training itself. Labor's policy positions on climate, energy, industrial relations and taxation effectively provide a clear and present danger to the industrial and mining sectors, which provide the jobs that apprentices ultimately perform. Labor's ongoing war on mining, forestry and manufacturing means that apprentices seeking work and rewarding careers in these industries are firmly in Labor's sights. Labor say they believe in education, and that's fine, but the whole point of a vocational education is to have a meaningful, well-paying and rewarding job at the end of that training. If the industry isn't there then the job isn't there, and if the job isn't there then who needs training? It's a pity Labor appears wilfully ignorant of the real economy side of the VET coin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on the government's proven commitment to the VET sector. It was the Liberal-National government which made available up to $1.5 billion over five years for the Skilling Australians Fund and, in the process, helped to create thousands of extra apprenticeships to build the national skills base and create the jobs that underpin our strong economy. I am proud to be part of a government that is working hard to restore vocational education and training to its rightful place and make our VET system world class. While the reforms outlined by this bill may seem relatively modest and administrative in nature, their impact will be widely felt. A stronger VET system means an even stronger economy, especially when underlying industries are encouraged and supported, by this Liberal-National government, with lower taxes, less red tape and greater access to markets. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:32</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019. As part of our commitment to vocational skills, the Australian government introduced the Trade Support Loans scheme in July 2014 to help Australian apprentices successfully complete their apprenticeship. These loans provide up to $21,078 over four years to eligible apprentices to assist them with the costs of living and learning while undertaking their training. The bill represents a reasonable and measured change to the program to provide for offsetting, where participants remain eligible for TSL payments in the future, and a range of other administrative changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme was introduced at a time when Australia's skills pipeline was incredibly broken. There weren't enough apprentices going into training, and even fewer were completing their training. Many of those who did fell by the wayside because of the fragmented approach to skills and employment in place under previous governments. This took place under a backdrop of an economy in repair—one which was only just starting to produce the jobs that we are now starting to see the results of today.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2014 this program has been extraordinarily successful. This has been due in no small part to the coalition government's broader economic agenda. Not only are we providing support to young Australians looking to get into their chosen profession; we're ensuring that there are long-term and sustainable jobs for them when they finish their training. The economy we have overseen is delivering for them. We're helping so many young Australians to realise their aspirations. In fact, 55,998 in the last financial year alone participated in this program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike many in this chamber—the Greens and those opposite—we want people to have a go. We want people to undertake a qualification, to get out there and start a business, if that's what they choose to do, and to make a success of themselves. And we know that as a government our role is to ensure that the economic conditions in this country are such that all Australians are able to realise the opportunity we are afforded as members of this great nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a lucky country. It's a phrase we hear so often in this place, but for me as a Western Australian there is no place with more opportunity and potential than the great state that I represent. As someone who has come into the Australian Senate having spent my working life getting people into meaningful employment through gaining vocational skills, there is no-one more proud of this government's record than me. But I didn't start my career working in the vocational sector; I was actually a student in the vocational sector. That's where I started. I did an apprenticeship in electronic servicing. Back then, there wasn't a loan scheme; there was only a small grant that you'd get provided as an apprentice. From memory, I think it was about $250. I used that money to buy a soldering iron, to buy a pair of cutters to put in my tool bag and to buy a volt meter, which I had to use as part of my job. I still have those items today, and I cherish them very much. I use them quite regularly when I've got a repair job at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would have loved to have had the kind of support that this government is providing through this scheme as a young apprentice starting out. I had a 1972 Honda Civic—that vehicle is older than me—and it wasn't very reliable. There were times when my boss was quite upset at me, because my car would break down on the way to work, and it was becoming quite an issue. It wasn't until I got into my apprenticeship and started to earn the salary that I could build up the means to buy my next car, which was a Toyota Celica—which wasn't exactly the best choice of vehicle, I've got to say. It took me some time. For that first nine months or so I was very irregular in getting to work on time, because I had problems with my car. But had I had this loan available to me then, I wouldn't have had such a hurdle in starting out in my career, because I could have used those funds to help me get into a reliable vehicle much earlier. This scheme is available for the person receiving it to use it for what they need in order to advance in their career and in their trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These programs don't operate in isolation. We know that you can't just throw money at a program and expect it to work. It's a convenient point of oversight by those opposite that this government has a range of policies and initiatives in this place to ensure that our strong, job-creating economy is one that delivers benefits and opportunities for all Australians. The Morrison government is delivering the job opportunities, providing pathways and ensuring that all Australians are able to realise their aspirations—programs such as the Try, Test and Learn Fund; the Individual Placement and Support program; the PaTH program, which is helping young people as well, providing a new and bright future for so many in this country who want nothing more than a job. As a Liberal I'm extremely proud that the coalition government has committed over $40 million to roll out the VTEC program across Australia, a program I was involved in that is seeing tens of thousands of Indigenous people go into training with a guarantee of a job at the completion of that training program. We know, from the data we've seen through that program, that over 70 per cent of those jobseekers are still in work some six months later. This is a remarkable achievement by those individuals who have gone into the program as well as by those who are delivering it—those training providers, those support workers, those mentors who are helping jobseekers to address their barriers to employment and to see them train and then successfully go into those jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout my life, I've worked with people from all walks of life—from our cities to our remote regions—many of whom were individuals and families who had found themselves entrenched in our welfare system, with significant barriers to finding a job. Have I ever heard them sympathise with the unfunded empathy and meaningless gestures of those opposite? No. They want new skills. They want meaningful employment. I've been privileged to see the reality and practical effect of this on countless lives. When you lift people up so that they can see the horizon, when they earn their first pay cheque, when they see that they can independently support their family and take part in all the advantages that 21st century life enables, the transformation is truly amazing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I'm proud to be part of a government that has seen over 1.5 million jobs created since coming into office—a government which is overseeing an economy that will create 1.25 million jobs over the next five years. These are not just part-time and casual jobs; they're full-time, long-term, well-paying and sustainable jobs. This means that we've also seen the lowest levels of welfare dependency in 30 years. This is our record, the record of the Morrison government. Between 2014 and 2019, 185,000 fewer Australians were on welfare, despite a population increase of over two million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're committed to ensuring that Australians have the right skills for the workforce of today and tomorrow. This is what our economic agenda is delivering, and this is what our $3 billion investment in vocational education is delivering. We're providing an increasing share of funding to train the next generation of Australians. This includes $1.5 billion to the states and territories every year through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development; $1.1 billion to fund the government's own skills programs, including employer incentives and support for apprentices; and $175 million to the states and territories via the Skilling Australians Fund to support increased apprenticeship and traineeship numbers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, we are paying to fix Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP scheme. The failure of Labor's scheme and the impacts of Labor's cuts cast a long shadow over the entire sector. Since 2016, over 66,500 students have had VET FEE-HELP loan debts of over $1 billion recredited by the Commonwealth. Repairing this disastrous program has been an ongoing agenda item across all three terms of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've ended the systemic exploitation of students by dodgy providers, where they signed up to accumulate huge debts for training packages that were never delivered. There is nothing more demoralising than going into a training course, having been told it is going to be something terrific for your life, and getting sold a pup—going through that training course, and there's nothing at the end of it. It's completely demoralising. We remember the days when we saw ads for dodgy providers, standing out the front of Centrelink, preying upon vulnerable Australians, handing out laptops and iPads, the latest tech, if you signed up for a course with extraordinary fees—exorbitant fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've ensured that this will never happen again. No government in good conscience could allow this behaviour to flourish, yet Labor did. In contrast, we've introduced VET Student Loans so that students can access financial support to gain their qualifications, safe in the knowledge that they will not be ripped off. The students have the control here. The loan is in their hands, and they are in charge of their own finances. They've got the ability to make their own decisions, and we're empowering them to be able to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reflect on the appalling record of those opposite in this space. Over just two years, all the same faces opposite gutted over $1.2 billion from the employer incentives to take on apprentices. Nine times in two years the Labor Party wielded the knife against apprenticeship incentives. Every time they needed to make a cut they went straight for the apprentices. This was a consequence of a Labor government that could not control the budget. When the Leader of the Opposition was Deputy Prime Minister, he, along with Senator Wong as the finance minister and the member for McMahon as Treasurer, cut over $240 million out of apprenticeship incentives in a single year. That has to be a record. This is just the beginning of the mess that Labor left behind—a mess that has taken us six years to fix. They presided over an economy that failed to create jobs, and this resulted in our vocational education programs training many Australians just for the sake of it, with little prospect of employment at the end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd think that from all of this they would have learnt a lesson. Whilst we on this side of the chamber continue to stand for growing jobs and growing our industries, they do not. We want to encourage new investment in resource projects across the country that drive jobs in regional centres and lift millions across the world out of poverty. All those members over there, including those in the Otis group, do not. This is the type of country they want to see Australians living in—no investment, no industry, no jobs, no regional economies and no future. It seems that only under duress do they support any industry that drives our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is undeterred and focused on getting on with the job of ensuring Australia has a world-class vocational education system. I'm a product of the trade training system. That was part of my early career. It laid a foundation for me. I know what impact that this is having. I have met many apprentices who are benefiting from the support of this program. I know what it would have meant when I was a young apprentice. I can see the difference that it's making in their lives. The government is committed to providing support to young apprentices so that they can get on and build a fantastic career and have the economic independence that they deserve.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:47</span>):  It is a real privilege to follow Senator O'Sullivan when speaking on the Trade Support Loans Amendment (Improving Administration) Bill 2019. I know Senator O'Sullivan has done in his working life as much as anyone in this place to provide people in some of our most disadvantaged communities with access to training, real employment and careers. Many of us here maybe take that for granted, but he provided those opportunities to people who didn't have those opportunities before. So I open my remarks by acknowledging Senator O'Sullivan's real contribution in this area. It really is inspiring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another inspiring thing, which I was fortunate to be associated with in my preparliamentary career in the mining industry, is the provision of apprenticeships and training opportunities to people in one of the poorest countries in the world—Laos. In that environment there were hardly any training opportunities for young Lao people. The company I worked for there set up an apprenticeship training program at both of its mine sites. It put dozens of young Lao people through apprenticeship training programs. We saw how important it was to those young people in that poor country, how it transformed their lives and how it gave them skills, education and training that they could take forward for the rest of their lives and for the benefit of their people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand in this place to speak on this subject because I'm extraordinarily passionate about the difference that education, training and apprenticeships can make to young people, whether they be here in Australia—in our regions, cities or the poorest and most socially disadvantaged areas—or in other parts of the world. It's absolutely fundamental that we provide our young people with those educational training opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make another preliminary observation in this debate. When I was preparing these remarks I recollected a conversation I had with a good friend just after we had finished high school. That's going back 33 years, but I still remember this conversation. Thirty-three years ago, as I was about to attend the University of Queensland and take on a tertiary education, my friend, who didn't go to university, said: 'Paul, you know what? We need to reflect, as a society, on the fact that someone like you is going to university.' At that time university was free, so for two of my five years at university I had the benefit of a free education. My friend said that we needed to reflect on the fact that he was someone that wasn't going down the university path, and where was the support for him? I think one of the best things about this loan program is that it provides opportunities for people who aren't going to university to access quality training, to access apprenticeships and to actually get the support they need to obtain that education and training for the rest of their life. So it is a great honour to speak in favour of this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak in relation to the actual content of this bill, I want to address some of the remarks of Senator Ayres in this debate earlier. I have great respect for Senator Ayres and for the work he did prior to coming to this place, standing up for working people. When he says he is passionate about apprenticeships across our economy, whether it be in the regions or the cities, wherever it may be, I absolutely can see that passion when he speaks and when he addresses this chamber. However, it is difficult to sit by and listen to Senator Ayres blame this government for the current situation with respect to apprenticeship numbers. It's difficult to sit here and listen to that in the context where the greatest fall in apprentice numbers on record, in this country's history, occurred in 2012 to 2013, under a Labor government, when apprenticeship numbers fell by 110,000, or 22 per cent. That was under the previous Labor government. It is difficult to sit by and not respond to Senator Ayres's comments, when over just two years those opposite—many of them are still there—when they were in government gutted over $1.2 billion from employer incentives to take on apprentices. What was one of the reasons for this? The debacle, as Senator O'Sullivan referred to, of the VET FEE-HELP program. And it was an absolute debacle. We're still paying the costs of that debacle today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't just take my words for it. I've got an article here from the University of Melbourne, written by Francesca Saccaro and Robyn Wright. Let me quote from this article:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments to the HESA legislation enabled substantial growth in the number of approved VET FEE-HELP providers from 37 in 2009 to 254 in 2014, a huge increase in eligible courses and a massive increase in VET FEE-HELP loans by both private and public providers. Large scale business opportunities were seized. Private providers went 'public', selling shares which over time became worthless. The "no upfront fees" and "pay later" slogans—</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are not my words; they are those authors' words. Then they give a number of case studies of some of the absolutely abhorrent marketing techniques engaged in by some of these providers. Here are two examples. Example one: an older woman in her early 70s was at the Bankstown Central shopping centre, having lunch with her Bible group, when they were approached by a young man asking them if they would like a free laptop and a free diploma in community services. He assured them that though they had to sign up for a government loan they would never have to repay it, as they would need to earn over $50,000. This was a group of pensioners signed up for a VET-FEE program under Labor—a group of pensioners in a Bible study—an absolute disgrace, and they agreed they would never be earning that much. Of course they wouldn't be earning that much. They were pensioners in a Bible group. The whole group signed up and got their laptops. That's what happened under Labor. The whole group signed up and got their laptops under Labor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the other example: in March 2014 a group of senior citizens from Bankstown, all from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and with little English, were talked into enrolling in computer classes with Unique International College in Granville—absolutely unique—and Aspire College of Education in Parramatta. It turned out that there was no computer class, and they were all enrolled in different diploma courses and had filled out forms to take out VET FEE-HELP. This was under the previous Labor government. Senator Tim Ayres didn't mention it in his comments, but this is what happened under the previous government. They were each offered a free computer iPad or $1,000 cash—'There you go'—by taking out the loan. They were told, 'There's no need to come to class,' but if they wished they could come and free lunch would be offered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's apparently no such thing as a free lunch, but under Labor these unscrupulous marketeers were out there offering a free lunch. But there was no free lunch for the Australian taxpayer. They alleged, in Aspire college, that they had a canteen that could accommodate a couple of hundred people, and, on the day, it was packed with senior citizens enjoying their free lunch. That's under the previous Labor government. We didn't hear that from Senator Tim Ayres, not at all. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not sit here and be lectured by those opposite with respect to what is or what is not effective and efficient vocational educational training, because those opposite were absolutely clueless when they were in government. You actually weep tears when you think what good that money could have been applied to with a well-run, efficient policy with the benefit of those hundreds of millions of dollars which were squandered under those opposite instead of lining the pockets of every rogue and dodgy marketeer signing up 70-year-old pensioners in Bankstown city hall, for goodness sake!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is quite prepared to defend its record in relation to these matters. In 2019-20 the coalition is investing over $3 billion in vocational education training—not in dodgy schemes, where courses aren't delivered, but in real, practical schemes which will deliver skills and jobs for young people. This includes: $1.5 billion given to the states and territories every year through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development; $1.1 billion to fund the government's own skills programs, including employers incentives and support for apprentices; $175 million to the states and territories via the Skilling Australians Fund to support increased apprenticeships and traineeship numbers; and $2.3 million to Tasmania to support increased apprenticeships and trainees needed for the Battery of the Nation initiative, the renewable energy sector and related sectors. These are schemes delivering real training and real jobs to young people in this country. When I look at those schemes I can't help but return to the lost opportunity of those hundreds of millions of dollars which were squandered under the previous Labor government and the difference it could have made to young people's lives if that program had been efficiently and effectively managed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation deals with quite a technical matter in relation to ensuring that when an apprentice is perhaps overpaid in certain circumstances, an instalment of TSL, that money can be offset against future payments instead of having to be repaid. It is quite a simple piece of legislation. It corrects something that has perhaps caused an administrative burden which is not necessary. I applaud the legislation, and I applaud what the government has achieved in the vocational education and training space. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019 will establish a new Australian government agency, to be known as Sport Integrity Australia, to protect the integrity of Australian sport. Well might my colleagues scoff and those opposite cringe when the words 'sport' and 'integrity' are mentioned in the same sentence in this place. It is ironic, and no doubt more than a little awkward, for the government to be talking about integrity in sport. We are all aware of the shocking revelations of the past month. First, it was Senator McKenzie's sports rorts scandal and now we've got the sequel, which I've heard described as 'sports rorts 2—look who's rorting now'. But while integrity might not be something that the Morrison government takes seriously in relation to itself, it is an issue that is very serious for Australia's sports sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new agency that will be established by this legislation will bring together a range of sports integrity functions that are currently the responsibility of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, ASADA, the National Integrity of Sport Unit and Sport Australia. The establishment of such an agency was a key recommendation of the 2018 review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements, known as the Wood review. It recommended the establishment of:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a National Sports Integrity Commission to cohesively draw together and develop existing sports integrity capabilities, knowledge and expertise, and to nationally coordinate all elements of the sports integrity threat response including prevention, monitoring and detection, investigation and enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to implement the government's response to that recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements was announced in August 2017 by the then Minister for Sport, Mr Greg Hunt. The review panel was chaired by the Hon. James Wood, a former justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court and a former chairman of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales. Senator McKenzie, who took over the portfolio from Mr Hunt, received the Wood review in March 2018 and released the government's response to the review in February 2019. Senator Colbeck is now the Minister for Youth and Sport and it is his job to implement the government's response to the Wood review. It is a detailed and extensive review—nearly 300 pages and it contains 52 recommendations. The government has been cooperative in facilitating briefings by departmental officials on both the Wood review and on various aspects of the proposed response to its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work done through the review process builds on Labor's establishment of the National Integrity of Sport Unit in 2012 and its strengthening of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority's powers in 2013. In government, Labor recognised the need to evaluate the effectiveness of Australia's sports integrity measures and to upgrade and update them when needed in order to address changing environments and new threats. Protecting Australia's sports integrity is a goal that has bipartisan support. Labor intends to continue that bipartisan approach by supporting the establishment of Sport Integrity Australia through these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about why it is important that governments invest in protecting the integrity of sport. Sport is an integral part of our way of life in Australia, whether it be through supporting local, state and national teams from the stands or from our living rooms, taking the kids to school or junior club sport or swimming lessons, pulling on the boots or strapping on the pads as a weekend warrior at the grassroots level, or training hard and striving to compete at the elite level. Most Australians have a connection to sport in some way, the value of which is enormous: exercise through physical activity and all the health benefits that it brings; bringing people together, which builds and strengthens communities; family time; and the benefits to local, state and national economies from sporting events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergener</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ational r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview of Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">port 2017</span>, more than 90 per cent of Australian adults have an interest in sport, with 8.4 million adults and three million children participating in sport each year. That report also revealed that the sports sector's contribution to the Australian economy was equivalent to two to three per cent of GDP, employing more than 220,000 people, and attracting 1.8 million volunteers—Australia's largest volunteer sector. The work that those volunteers do is invaluable. Without them, most of the opportunities for Australians to participate in sport and to enjoy its health benefits wouldn't exist. Volunteering in sport, as in other sectors, is a labour of love. If those volunteers lose their love of sport because it is tainted by doping, match fixing or other integrity threats, our nation risks losing that huge and immensely important volunteer contribution. Labor commends every one of those volunteers for the huge and valuable contribution they make to Australian communities and society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the Morrison government has treated those very same volunteers with complete contempt. In many cases, club volunteers put hundreds of hours into preparing grant applications to the Community Support and Infrastructure Grants Program, but they are still waiting on an apology from Senator McKenzie and Mr Scott Morrison for snubbing their meritorious applications so that they could run an industrial-scale pork-barrelling scheme. Just as threats to the integrity of sport can leave volunteers and workers disillusioned, so too can a total lack of integrity from government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we must progress efforts to protect the integrity of Australian sport, even as the Morrison government makes a mockery of integrity in government. We must progress, because we know, through studies like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational review of Australian sport </span>and others, that sport can make a major contribution to our health and wellbeing. Participation in sport can play an important role in an active, healthy lifestyle, combating obesity and physical inactivity. For our children, sport improves outcomes in core academic fields and also teaches life skills and improves retention. Sport brings people together like few sectors can and is a rich source of social capital. And success on the international stage builds national pride and reinforces Australia's international reputation for excellence in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's never a shortage of great Aussie sporting success stories. Over the weekend our brilliant Australian women's cricket team recorded yet another win. The Bushfire Bash has reportedly raised $7 million for fire-impacted communities, on top of the $2 million that Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association have committed. Ash Barty is No. 1 in the world. I could go on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to why we must protect the integrity of Australian sport, I note that every time we hear a good-news story like the ones I've just mentioned it enhances the reputation of Australian sport and our love for it. But every time we hear reports of doping in sport, or when we hear reports of match fixing, it damages and devalues sport's reputation and our love for it. Labor, in government, was proactive in deploying measures to protect against these and other threats to the integrity of sport in Australia. But those threats evolved, and so must Australia's protection measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to implement an important part of the first stage of Australia's response to the 52 recommendations of the Wood review. To paraphrase the review's report, a centrally coordinated response to sport integrity issues will help overcome the silo effect that currently exists, with multiple bodies, including NSOs, law enforcement and regulatory agencies engaged in protecting sport from threats. The review also noted that the difficulties in securing a coordinated response is compounded by our federated system, in which there are often differences in state, territory and federal regulatory and criminal laws. And, as I mentioned in my remarks on the National Sports Tribunal Bill 2019 in this place last year, the need for measures to strengthen Australia's sport integrity arrangements is something Labor recognised and acted on in government. The establishment of Sport Integrity Australia, through this bill, is yet another step towards strengthening Australia's defences against any and all threats to Australia's sports integrity. Given the value of sports to Australians, Australian society and the Australian economy, this is something that Labor supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has worked closely with stakeholders in relation to the government's implementation of its response to the Wood review, and we will continue to do that. I note that this bill was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee late last year, and the committee reported on the bill last week. Most submissions to the committee supported the establishment of Sport Integrity Australia. The Australian Olympic Committee's submission, for example, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is paramount to the integrity of sport in an increasingly complex sporting environment that there is a co-ordinated national approach against doping, matchfixing, illegal gambling, corruption and participant protection issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few concerns remain, and Labor has been informed that the government, through Minister Colbeck, has undertaken to work with stakeholders to address those concerns, where possible, through implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding those remaining concerns, the committee recommended that the Senate pass this bill. Labor will continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the establishment and operation of Sport Integrity Australia is done in an appropriate way and that the agency can deliver the outcomes it will be tasked with achieving. We will also continue to work to ensure the government's broader response to the recommendation of the Wood review is appropriate and as strong as possible, to protect the important role sport plays in our Australian way of life, now and into the future. Labor support the bill, and we commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

What chutzpah, while it is in the midst of a massive corruption scandal over sports rorts! Introducing this bill just serves to underline how it's a matter of: 'Do as I say, not as I do; don't watch what's going on.' We've got a government that has shown absolutely no integrity over this issue, right up to the Prime Minister. He's refused to answer questions about his role in the sport rorts affair and whether he was aware of the role his office played. We've got a report by his former chief of staff, now the head of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, which has not been made public—and I'm flagging that we Greens are going to be asking for the Gaetjens report again this week. Sports integrity matters and examining the standards that are set out in this legislation only serve to highlight the hypocrisy of this government. While this legislation talks of integrity, ethics and values that promote confidence in sport, those opposite are rorting the system. They are pork-barrelling, through sports rorts 1 and sports rorts 2—a quarter of a billion dollars in rorting the system, undermining integrity in sport!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to this bill—the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019 establishes Sport Integrity Australia, which will be a single body to administer and coordinate the work necessary to prevent and address threats to sports integrity in Australia. This follows, of course, the review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements, or the Wood review. In response to the Wood review, the government has adopted a two-stage approach: the first stage establishes Sport Integrity Australia, and a second stage will establish the sport integrity capabilities that the Wood review proposed, including a joint investigations and intelligence unit, a strategic analysis unit and the transfer of sports gambling work from the Sports Betting Integrity Unit of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to Sport Integrity Australia. This bill will abolish ASADA, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, and create Sport Integrity Australia. It will expand the functions of the CEO of Sport Integrity Australia to include broader sports integrity functions and will create an advisory council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the Greens are supportive of what this bill aims to do, however, there are a number of concerns that have been raised about the measures that are covered in this bill that we remain concerned about. Some submissions that were made on this bill, including that of Dr Annette Greenhow, noted that the bill will rely on the external affairs powers under the Constitution—although Australia has not yet ratified the relevant agreement, the Macolin Convention. This seems to be something that really needs to be sorted out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights notes that changes in this bill will engage the right to privacy. In particular, the committee notes that, 'No information has been provided as to why each exemption from the Privacy Act is required or proportionate.' The committee noted particular concerns about sharing personal information with overseas entities, and also noted that Sport Integrity Australia will have exemptions from the requirement to have individuals consent before collecting sensitive information in certain circumstances and to notify eligible data breaches where the CEO believes this would likely prejudice enforcement activities. These are very concerning issues that've been raised by the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we support the establishment of Sport Integrity Australia, as recommended by the Wood review, but we remain deeply concern about these issues and we will be looking very closely to see how Sport Integrity Australia ensures that it's respecting the right to privacy in its actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another crucial clause in the bill is related to defining integrity. Specifically, 'sports integrity' is defined in the bill as 'the manifestation of the ethics and values that promote confidence in sport'. Sadly, again, returning to my theme at the beginning, the government has, in its actions over the last month, undermined confidence in sport precisely by failing to display ethics and values in its handling of funding. The issues around the sports rorts are not going away. We have another hearing of our Senate inquiry later this week and we will continue to prosecute this issue, because it is undermining integrity. It is undermining the confidence that people can have in sports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note here that we think, as part of the package of saying that we are concerned about integrity in sport, that the government really needs to make some amends when it comes to the sports rorts. A good start would be to fund the deserving clubs that missed out on funding. Those clubs that would have been funded if it had been a level playing field, if the sports values of fairness and a fair go for all had actually been followed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that would be good to indicate that the government was really concerned about integrity in sport would be for the Prime Minister to provide a full and honest account of the role that his office played in administering these grants. These are issues that we will certainly be continuing to explore in the Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill today is part of a package of bills that the government is introducing to implement the Wood review recommendations. We have also been examining, through the community affairs committee, another piece of legislation that the coalition has proposed—and the committee report was tabled just this afternoon. This is the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill. I want to talk a little bit about some of our concerns with that bill. Although we have got concerns with this Sport Integrity Australia bill, which is here before us today, overall we think it is a piece of legislation that needs to be supported. But the next bit of legislation that the government is introducing, we think, has got far more problems and once again shows that the balance is not quite right when it comes to making sure that we've got integrity in sport and making sure that people can be assured that there is fairness, that there aren't doping violations going on. But at the same time we need to be protecting the rights of athletes. We believe that basic human rights are important, and there is a long recognised common law right to not self-incriminate. The next bit of legislation that the committee report submitted this afternoon, and our dissenting report to that, highlights that this is a big issue with that legislation: the common-law right to not self-incriminate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to quote my colleague Senator Di Natale, sitting just behind me today, when he spoke on this issue back in 2013, when we Greens successfully amended the ASADA amendment bill that was before the Senate, then, in order to ensure the protection of the right to not self-incriminate. Senator Di Natale said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are talking about athletes here, some of them are young kids, they are not going to be familiar with detailed legal processes, they should be able to compete and know that if ASADA does want to question them about something that they are afforded the same rights they would be if they were questioned by the police or by some other legal jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have more to say on this issue when we are debating the enhancing capability bill. But we are very concerned with the approach being proposed by the government in the sports portfolios. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've raised these concerns in a number of contexts already. We have raised them in the dissenting report that was tabled this afternoon. I think it is very sad but perhaps typical of the coalition to be taking away human rights, even in the sports portfolio, while, at the same time, they themselves are rorting a community sports program and violating community trust. Some of our other concerns are expanding the powers of ASADA when there is quite considerable evidence of ASADA overreaching and overusing their existing powers—intimidating athletes who, in the end, are innocent, overstepping the mark and putting athletes through hell while they're doing that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next bit of legislation that we're going to be looking at will give ASADA even more power. They will be able to bring in an athlete for questioning and make them jump through hoops and put them through huge issues—basically putting them through hell—not on the basis of a reasonable belief but only that they reasonably suspect. And what does it mean to reasonably suspect that somebody is guilty of a doping violation? Basically, it could just be a hunch. So we are very concerned about that. Similarly, this next bit of legislation is going to be removing the right for athletes to appeal to the AAT, which we don't think is appropriate, and make it harder for athletes to access information relevant to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned. On the one hand, we've got good rationale for making sure that we have a system where there is integrity in sport. On the other hand, we've got a government that is not leading by example. We've got really significant concerns about how this coalition government can have any pretence to be overseeing integrity in sports. They have already overseen political corruption in the sports rorts scandal. There has been a corrupt coalition cover-up over the Gaetjens report. So I now move a second reading amendment to this legislation to reflect those concerns:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019. As chair of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee I am pleased to make a contribution to the debate. On 17 October 2019 the House of Representatives introduced the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019. It was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 14 November 2019 and the committee tabled its report on 5 February this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you have heard from previous contributions, the bill seeks to amend the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006, the ASADA Act, to establish Sport Integrity Australia as a single body for the administration and coordination of functions to prevent and address threats to sports integrity in Australia. It also seeks to bring together all existing national sports integrity functions and capabilities across the Commonwealth. The bill responds to the key findings of the Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements, the Wood review, which addressed the vulnerability of Australian sport to future corruption. It is important we establish a central, specialised intelligence capability to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport plays a significant role in the Australian way of life. Our sport-loving nation regularly comes to a standstill for major sporting events like the AFL Grand Final, the Ashes, the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and the Australian Open, but on any given day, particularly at weekends, sporting facilities around the country are populated with people of all ages participating in and cheering on any number of sports, and if we're not there we're probably playing cricket in the backyard. Quite simply, it's a part of who we are as Australians. As Australians, we expect the sports that we participate in and watch to be fair and honest representations of the game, and we expect sport to be free of corruption. We have a high expectation of those who play, coach and manage sport, whether in a professional or an amateur capacity, and we need confidence that our sports are protected from threats to this integrity. Cheating and misconduct in sport, and sporting environments where abuse, discrimination and harassment are prevalent, are all considered harshly because of the importance sport enjoys in our national identity. Sport is also an integral component of the Australian economy. Any threat to the integrity of Australian sport will have direct consequences for the health, economic, social and cultural benefits of sport, as well as having the capacity to undermine potential investment in sport. A major threat to sports integrity could spell the end to Australian culture as we know it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review identified avenues for enhancing Australia's capability to respond effectively to the increasing sophistication and complexity of threats to the integrity of sport. It also recognised that the changing nature of sport and the international competition we enjoy means sports integrity matters now go beyond a single stakeholder. These matters are complex, and the global nature of our world now means that they can be connected across sports, industries, law enforcement, borders and time zones. That is a big web to control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review was undertaken after the then Minister for Sport requested a review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements in 2017. This review was part of the work conducted to develop a national sport plan, Sport 2030, in response to the growing global threat to the integrity of sport. The review was conducted by an independent and expert panel led by the Hon. James Wood AO QC. The Wood review was tasked with examining the following three areas: firstly, the current environment and threats around national and international sports and foreseeable future challenges; secondly, the adequacy of Australia's current sports integrity capability, particularly the capability of ASADA and Australia's sports sector to address contemporary doping threats, the effectiveness of the 2011 national policy on match-fixing, including the merits of becoming a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions—the Macolin convention—the case for national match-fixing laws, the merits of establishing a formal national platform for effective ongoing detection of and response to betting related sports corruption and the merits of establishing a national sports integrity tribunal; and, finally, the options for structural changes to current sports integrity arrangements, including the merits of establishing a dedicated national sports integrity commission or similar entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review is considered to be the most comprehensive examination of sports integrity arrangements ever undertaken in Australia, if not the world. It found sports were challenged by a range of mounting integrity threats which include the increasing sophistication and incidence of doping; the globalisation of sports wagering, particularly through rapidly growing illegal online gambling markets; the infiltration and exploitation of the sports sector by organised crime; corruption in sports administration; and growing participant protection issues, particularly the sexual abuse of minors in sporting environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review report was presented to the government in March 2018. This report addressed key domestic and international threats to the integrity of sport, and made 52 recommendations across five key themes. These themes were: a stronger national response to match fixing through Australia becoming a party to the Macolin convention; the establishment of an Australian sports wagering scheme to sit within a proposed national sports integrity commission; a range of reforms aimed at enhancing Australia's antidoping capability; the establishment of a national sports tribunal; and the establishment of a national sports integrity commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In implementing the recommendations from the Wood review the government has adopted a two-stage approach. The Department of Health and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority made a joint submission to the committee's inquiry, explaining that the first stage of implementation should be to establish Sport Integrity Australia, and that the second stage of implementation would address the mechanisms needed to achieve the sports integrity recommendations proposed by the Wood review. Sport Integrity Australia will draw together and develop existing sports integrity capabilities, knowledge and expertise cohesively by coordinating all elements of the sports integrity threat response nationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport Integrity Australia will implement Australia's international obligations, both under the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport and, once in force and binding on Australia, the Macolin convention. In order to do this, Sport Integrity Australia will bring together the existing functions of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, the National Integrity of Sport Unit and the sports integrity functions of Sport Australia. Once established and operating, it is anticipated that Sport Integrity Australia will expand to include enhanced match-fixing detection and suspicious wagering alert capabilities, a whistleblower scheme, and promote national collaboration on sports wagering-related integrity frameworks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the Wood review's key recommendations was the establishment of a national sports integrity commission which would address the need for a formal national capability dedicated to coordinating the collection, analysis and dissemination of information and intelligence in relation to sports integrity. The Wood review found no existing Australian entity had the capability or power to obtain the information and intelligence necessary to understand and address threats to Australian sports integrity. In its joint submission to the inquiry, the Department of Health and ASADA explained that the establishment of Sport Integrity Australia would merge all functions and ongoing resources of the three current agencies to perform the existing sports integrity functions. These include policy and program delivery on all sports integrity matters; education and outreach on all sports integrity matters; the existing oversight of the implementation of adherence to sports integrity policies and programs by national sport organisations; antidoping monitoring, intelligence collection and investigations that are now performed by ASADA; and international engagement, including being the formal national platform for the purposes of the Macolin convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport Integrity Australia will act to prevent and address threats to sports integrity, aiming to achieve fair and honest sporting performances and outcomes; promoting positive conduct by athletes, administrators, officials and other stakeholders on and off the sporting arena; achieving a safe, fair and inclusive sporting environment at all levels; and enhancing the reputation and standing of sporting contests and of sport overall. To ensure the new agency can achieve all this, amendments will be made to the ASADA Act. These amendments are set out in the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019 and will abolish ASADA and create Sport Integrity Australia; expand the functions of Sport Integrity Australia's new chief executive officer to include functions related to broader sports integrity issues; and create an advisory council appointed by the minister to provide external expert advice of a general nature in relation to strategic and governance matters to the CEO of Sport Integrity Australia and the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who made submissions to the inquiry support the establishment of Sport Integrity Australia, in particular—and I note Senator Brown also quoted this submission—the Australian Olympic Committee submitted that it is, 'Paramount to the integrity of sport in an increasingly complex sporting environment that there is a coordinated national approach against doping, match-fixing, illegal gambling, corruption and participant protection issues.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing the second stage of implementing the Wood review's recommendations, the mechanisms proposed are a joint investigation and intelligence unit and a strategic analysis unit and the transfer of the sports wagering data monitoring and alert functions of the Sports Betting Integrity Unit from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to Sport Integrity Australia. The bill also amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 to ensure Sport Integrity Australia's ability to receive and disseminate information as required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A version of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019 was introduced in the 45th Parliament but lapsed when the House of Representatives was dissolved on 11 April 2019. We're committed to seeing this bill through in its updated format. To this end, the Department of Health and ASADA requested that the bill incorporate updates after consultation with stakeholders in relation to the earlier version of the bill. These updates include amendments to the object and CEO's functions and powers to better reflect the role and remit of the new agency; amendments to facilitate better information sharing by and with SIA; and consequential amendments to harmonise operation with the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee received six submissions during its inquiry. In relation to the matters raised in the submissions, the Wood review noted that sports integrity matters are complex, globalised, interconnected and beyond the control of any single stakeholder. The review found that Australia's vulnerabilities were exacerbated by the lack of nationally consistent legislative measures and other protections and development of centralised intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to connect Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. Indeed, the Wood review stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without the presence of a comprehensive, effective and nationally coordinated response capability the hard-earned reputation of sport in this country risks being tarnished …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this would potentially reduce participation rates, which would then diminish the social, cultural and economic value of the significant investment we make in sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As commented on by Senator Rice, in considering the bill's constitutionality, some submitters noted that there were no express Commonwealth constitutional powers to legislate in the areas of sport, sports integrity or crime. They also questioned whether, considering that lack of express power, the bill would be constitutional. However, section 3 of the ASADA Act identifies implementing Australia's international antidoping obligations as the foundation for the act, and the explanatory memorandum to the bill states that Sport Integrity Australia would implement Australia's international obligations under the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport and the Macolin convention, noting that the Macolin convention was not yet in force and binding on Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note—as was also mentioned by Senator Rice—that a new definition of sport integrity has been added to this bill which is the manifestation of the ethics and values that promote confidence in sport. Threats to sports integrity include doping, drug use, match-fixing and criminal exploitation of athletes and events, but this is by no means exhaustive. The establishment of Sport Integrity Australia is a significant first step in our efforts to protect the integrity of Australian sport. Sport Integrity Australia will draw together existing sports integrity capabilities into a single national agency, and the amendments proposed in the bill will provide a sound base from which to expand the remit and capability of Sport Integrity Australia. These amendments will equip Sport Integrity Australia with the tools it needs to meet Australia's international obligations and the expectations of stakeholders to ensure that Australian sport at all levels is safe, fair and inclusive. I urge the Senate to support the bill.</span>

                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:43</span>):  The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019 seeks to establish a new Australian government agency, to be known as Sport Integrity Australia, in response to a key recommendation of the 2018 Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements. This new agency would bring together a range of sports integrity functions that are currently the responsibility of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, the national sports integrity unit and Sport Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of such an agency was a key recommendation of the 2018 Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements, known as the Wood review. This bill seeks to implement an important part of the first stage of Australia's response to the 52 recommendations of the Wood review. To paraphrase the review, a centrally coordinated response to sports integrity issues will help overcome the silo effect that currently exists with multiple bodies, including NSOs, law enforcement and regulatory agencies, engaged in protecting sport from the many threats it faces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians expect fair, clean and safe sport. Labor are committed to appropriate responses to the real threats facing Australia's sport integrity. Threats to the integrity of sport in Australia evolve and so must government responses to them. The establishment of Sport Integrity Australia through this bill is another step towards further strengthening Australia's defences to any and all threats to Australia's sport integrity. Labor support this bill because we know it is important to invest in protecting the integrity of sport. Sport is an integral part of our Australian way of life—from supporting national teams from the stands or our living rooms to participating in local clubs on the weekends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport has been a constant in my life, and that's why last week I was thrilled to have a tour of the new world-class stadium in Townsville—a 25,000-seat venue that will open this weekend, where the people in Townsville will be able to use the stadium to watch their beloved Cowboys' home games as well as big musical acts like Sir Elton John this weekend. Cowboys fans extend all the way up to Cairns, where the Cowboys' second home is Barlow Park. Last Saturday I went along with a packed crowd to watch the Cowboys play the Broncos. They won by two points, by the way. It was really fantastic to be at the park's footy event where Queenslanders from communities all across remote and regional Far North Queensland came to watch. It was very clear that the tropical rain was not dampening anybody's spirits. They were there to watch and cheer their team because they love being a part of sport. Most Australians have a connection to sport in some way and get a lot of value from it. Sport is exercise, it brings people together and it offers economic value to our community. That is why it is important that government support the development of sport everywhere for everyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore disappointing that, at the same time that this government is calling for more integrity in sport, it has not led by example. Instead, this government rigged the Community Sport Infrastructure grants to win votes. It was set up to be a merit based funding program, and Sport Australia was tasked with independently assessing project applications from sporting clubs. Sport Australia provided their recommendations to the sports minister based on the grant criteria. Unfortunately, we know now that those recommendations were thrown in the bin. Instead, this government, or the minister's office, instituted a colour-coded spreadsheet of each application, coded by political party and, very importantly, by electorate and whether that electorate was marginal or a target electorate. That spreadsheet, we know now, was sent back and forth between the minister's office and the Prime Minister's office. We were coming up to an election and the government saw an opportunity to exploit the very thing that Australians consider should be fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first round of funding, 41 per cent of the grants the minister handed out were not endorsed by Sport Australia. In the second and third rounds, as the election got closer, this increased to 70 per cent and 73 per cent respectively. Approximately 43 per cent of the clubs awarded funding were ineligible at the time the agreement was signed. Sport Australia warned the minister that her interference was compromising its independence, but she persisted anyway. When the truth finally came out, the new sports minister, Minister Colbeck, was more concerned with where the leak of the spreadsheet had come from than the conduct of his own colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government still refuses to acknowledge what we already know—that the grants were handed out in a biased way to marginal and target seats just before the election to shore up votes that would win the government election but that would not give sports grants to clubs that desperately needed them. These are not professional clubs. They're mums and dads and volunteers, and they spent hours writing applications for local sports teams. They thought their grant applications would be considered on merit against everybody else's. They expected a level playing field. They were told: if they had a go, they'd get a go. But we know that that isn't true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the $100 million in grants that were misused under this government's scandalous sports rorts scheme, we also now know that an additional $150 million was spent in marginal seats on swimming pools. Regional and remote communities were flagged in the program's brief as 'key stakeholders'—the regional and remote communities that desperately need this funding, the regional and remote communities that members of this government say they represent—but less than $10 million was actually allocated to rural electorates, whilst Liberal-held, non-rural seats got nearly $110 million of that funding. We now know that this government blatantly abused at least a quarter of a billion dollars in public funds in its desperate attempt to boost its votes in marginal electorates in the lead-up to the election, and who missed out? Mums and dads in sporting clubs in rural and regional areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding was supposed to be used to develop female change room facilities at sporting grounds and community swimming facilities around Australia, but, when it came to sports rorts 2, no guidelines were even released and no applications were ever called for. Instead, the government pumped more than $100 million into pools for marginal coalition-held electorates. Less than 15 per cent of that funding was actually spent on female change rooms. How many times have we seen the Prime Minister and members of this government stand up in this house, in media conferences, and say that they rorted the system because of female change rooms—because they didn't want women getting changed in sheds? But, when we look at those figures, we know, and the women who are still getting changed in sheds know, that that had nothing to do with these funding decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, female sport deserves better. The government have disgracefully tried to pretend that they had a program aimed at spending money on women's change rooms. I know that women in Innisfail, at the Rugby League club there, in rural and regional Australia, still don't have their change rooms. These are the women that the Prime Minister said he was doing this program for. That's what he said: 'That is why we did it.' Yet a club in Innisfail, which scored 75 from Sport Australia and was recommended for funding, missed out. This government is faking its interest in women's sport, but the women of Australia can spot a dive when they see one. Australians expect integrity in sport and in their government. They expect it both on and off the field and they expect that if they have a go they will get a go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does support this bill, but it is galling of this government to bring in a bill about sports integrity when they haven't even tabled documents and reports about their own sports rorts scandal. They have an opportunity this week in the Senate to come in here and rectify that problem—to fess up, to give those mums and dads the answers they have been asking for and to fess up to the women of Australia who are still getting changed in sheds and tents out the back. Whether they do that or not is a question of this government's integrity. We know that this government have no integrity. We know that they refuse to answer questions when they're asked. We know that they refuse to do the right thing. This bill must be passed. It introduces good regimes in sport. But it is galling that the government are in here talking about sports integrity when they have none of it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:55</span>):  From hearing the very end of Senator Green's commentary on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019 I appreciate that the Labor Party agrees that action needs to be taken. It did take a very long time to get there, and we know definitely how she and her colleagues feel about other areas of sport. Certainly there are Senate committees looking into that, so I won't waste the Senate's time talking about that. I'm here to talk about the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this bill is an important signal that our government remains firmly committed to protecting Australia's sporting integrity. Sport plays a fundamental role in Australian life. Around the world we are known for our sporting success and for our commitment to fair play and integrity. Sport has shaped our culture and our identity as Australians. It reflects our broader values of sportsmanship and respect for the umpire. Safe, fair and inclusive sport is part of the Australian identity. Those values also underpin thriving communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From grassroots to the world's iconic grass courts and arenas, sport gives us our heroes. It allows us to collectively aspire to greatness while celebrating effort, hard work and perseverance. Sport keeps us fit and healthy. It is the social glue that binds us together. It creates communities and underpins much of community life. Particularly in regional areas such as mine, sport is integral to the social fabric of a region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport is also an essential part of our economy, as highlighted by the Boston Consulting Group's <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational review of Australian sport 2017</span>. Each year around 14 million Australians participate in some form of sporting activity. Sport generates $35 billion to $47 billion of economic activity, which is about two to three per cent of GDP and is equivalent to the agriculture sector, which I'm also passionate about. In addition, each year the Australian government invests in sport. It invests more than $300 million to support our high-performance sports. The government is very proud of its record of encouraging greater participation at community and grassroots levels. We want to get more Australians active. Sport and physical activity teach much about life skills—teamwork, sportsmanship, community spirit and a fair go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 5 August 2017 the then Minister for Sport, Greg Hunt, announced a review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements to be led by the Hon. James Wood QC. The Wood review, released in August 2018, was part of the development of Australia's first comprehensive national sport plan called Sport 2030. On behalf of the government I'd like to thank the Hon. James Wood and his fellow panel members for their efforts in producing the most comprehensive review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements ever conducted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review found that, amongst athletes at all levels, doping is more prevalent and widespread than ever. This is fuelled in large part by the increasing availability of highly sophisticated techniques that make it harder to detect. The Wood review also found serious and organised crime is involved in the supply of performance- and image-enhancing drugs. The current suite of protections and powers under the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 is not sufficient to facilitate ASADA's increasing emphasis on intelligence based investigations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our nation's first-ever sports plan, Sport 2030, we now have a clear path to build a more active Australia that operates with integrity. We can achieve sporting excellence and back grassroots community sports at the same time, and we need to safeguard the integrity of sport. We need to strengthen and build a thriving Australian sport and recreation industry. The government's introduction of this bill is an important signal that the Liberals and Nationals remain firmly committed to protecting Australian sporting integrity. The Wood review provides a sobering assessment of the sports integrity environment and the consequences of inaction and outlines a detailed road map to provide the protection that Australian sport deserves. The Wood review seeks to protect that fair go element that is critical to the Australian image of ourselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key recommendation of the review which was welcomed and accepted by government is that a new agency be established to draw together and develop existing sports integrity capabilities, knowledge and expertise. This bill will establish Sport Integrity Australia. So, from July 2020, Sport Integrity Australia will support sports stakeholders to manage the spectrum of sports integrity related issues. Sport Integrity Australia will bring together the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, or ASADA, the National Integrity of Sport Unit and the sports integrity functions within Sport Australia. It will establish a single point of responsibility for the range of sports integrity functions currently performed by these separate agencies. Sport Integrity Australia will become a one-stop shop engaging with and supporting all sports integrity stakeholders to combat all modern threats to the integrity of sport. Its initial focus will be on regulation, monitoring and intelligence, from policy development to education and delivery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without integrity underpinning our sporting competitions and events, we risk losing the great benefits that our sports deliver. Doping remains a scourge for sport right across the world. Match fixing is a global concern. Just as technological advancement has increased access to live sport through live streaming, phones and the like, so too has technological advancement increased the opportunities for unscrupulous, well-organised criminals to try to influence sporting outcomes. This is far beyond a poorly executed paint job on a ring-in horse at a suburban track. This is complex. It's globalised criminal operators manipulating parts of matches, participants, teams and officials. Organised crime is not just exploiting and undermining elite sport; it has infiltrated domestic and suburban competitions. Criminal elements are corrupting officials and athletes and cheating sports fans. Sports integrity requires a nationally coordinated response. Bullying and harassment remain prevalent and a concern, and, sadly, there are those in sport who will also prey on children. So Australia is not immune from these problems. Sporadically, the back-page news becomes front-page headlines when major sports are rocked by scandal. While we are world leaders in the fight against sports integrity threats, more needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm proud to be part of a government that takes these matters very seriously and is doing more. Our response will protect our cherished Australian sports for generations to come and will have lasting effects on the lives of all sports-loving Australians. I would think there is a lot of bipartisan goodwill around making sure our sport here in Australia is clean, safe and fair. I'm sure those sitting opposite share that aspiration for integrity in sports. This bill will help safeguard Australian sport and combat current, emerging and future threats from doping, match fixing, illegal betting, organised crime and corruption. This bill is to address all of that. Our government is absolutely committed to ensuring Australia has the highest possible standards of sports integrity so that Australians can trust that competitions and athletes are competing on a level playing field. Our aim is to keep all athletes—from the elite athletes to the juniors, from those playing on the MCG to those playing on the Deniliquin Oval—safe and involved, knowing that the sports in which they participate are clean and fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sporting organisations will have greater access to integrity education, right down to community levels. They will have access to clearer, faster, transparent and cost-effective resolution of disputes, resulting in administrative and financial savings. Enhanced match-fixing detection and response will reassure sports that their competitions are less likely to be manipulated. Parents and guardians of our junior athletes will know that their children are protected from sport integrity threats and that they can be confident that the sports in which they participate are clean, fair and safe. Law enforcement agencies will benefit from improved coordination and clear, cohesive national-level regulation and legislation for match fixing and related corruption. They will benefit from improved information and from the enhanced sport integrity criminal intelligence capability of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. Wagering providers will be involved in alerting authorities to suspicious activity within betting markets, enabling real-time action to be taken to ensure the integrity of competitions they are offering markets on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's record on safeguarding sport is there for the world to see. Twelve months ago, then sports minister Senator Bridget McKenzie signed the Australian government on to the Macolin convention, alongside Gabriella Battaini-Dragoni, Deputy Secretary of the Council of Europe. The Macolin convention is the only multilateral treaty specifically aimed at combating match fixing and related corruption in sport. Australia was a key contributor to the drafting of the convention, and we are the first country outside Europe to sign up. This signing was a major step in protecting the safety, fairness and integrity of the sporting competitions we all enjoy so much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By engaging formally with the parties to the Macolin convention, Australia is empowered to create a fully effective national platform to enhance detection of and coordinate responses to match fixing and related corruption in Australian sport and sports competitions. Membership of the Macolin community will enable Australia to obtain formal, ongoing access to international counterparts and meetings to work together and drive those measures to combat sport corruption at a global level. We can work to pass national match-fixing criminal legislation and support an effective global response to international sport integrity matters. Signing the Macolin convention supports national match-fixing criminal legislation, complements similar laws, where they already exist within our states and territories, and brings consistency to the national ability to protect sport from wagering related corruption.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:08</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Sport Integrity Australia) Bill 2019, as it addresses important issues for our country. This bill implements a key recommendation of the 2018 review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements, led by the Hon. James Wood AO QC—that is, the recommendation to give one agency responsibility for several sports integrity functions of the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, why is sport so important? There are a few reasons. Sport is big business. The global sports market, not including wagering, has an estimated turnover of US$1.5 trillion. The overall size of the sports market in Australia was estimated to be $27 billion in 2015, including the $10 billion annually that Australians pay for participation in sport and other physical activity. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational review of Australian sport 2017</span> estimated the sector's contribution to the Australian economy to be two to three per cent of gross domestic product, employing more than 220,000 people. Sport also attracts around 1.8 million volunteers—a massive number, considering that the number of people volunteering Australia-wide was estimated at only twice that number in the last census.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sports wagering market, which was a particular focus of the Wood review, is growing rapidly and had an estimated turnover of $9.7 billion in 2015-16. This was a 35 per cent increase from the previous year—by far, the fastest growth for any Australian gambling sector. If you throw racing into the mix, the turnover reached a staggering $28.1 billion in 2015-16. So, whether it is TV rights, wagering, sponsorship, ticket sales, membership subscription or any other aspect of financing sport, from the elite level right down to the grassroots, sport is one of Australia's biggest industry sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any business, we expect sport to be conducted in a genuinely competitive environment. We expect a level playing field. We know that, like any other area of business, success in sport leads to commercial advantages, sponsorship, prize money and promotion in higher levels of competition. Just like any other area of business, people who do the right thing suffer when others get an advantage by unfair means. In sport, unfair advantage can include such things as match-fixing, bribery, taking performance-enhancing substances or other forms of cheating. When a club or athlete benefits financially from these offences, it means that others who are playing fair lose out. But the consequences aren't just financial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reason that sport integrity is important is because of the way sport is woven into the daily lives of Australians. It is an integral part of our culture. The intergenerational review found that 90 per cent of Australian adults have an interest in sport and that 8.4 million adults and three million children participate in sport each year. It's a great Aussie tradition to go to sports matches on the weekend, to watch grand finals over a barbie with family and friends or to make weekly trips to junior sports matches with the kids. Most Australians have some kind of connection to sport, even if it's just sitting on the couch watching footy or playing a game of backyard cricket at a family barbecue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that when people cheat in sport—whether it's through doping, bribery or match-fixing—it lessens our enjoyment as participants or as spectators. If we lose trust in the integrity of sport, we lose interest. And, if we lose interest, we stop playing, we stop attending and we stop watching. But sport itself is not the only victim when this happens. A drop in participation also means the loss of many benefits that come with sport. It has consequences for the health and wellbeing of Australians, it has consequences for community cohesiveness and social inclusion, and it has consequences for the Australian economy. The danger is summarised in the Wood review as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without the presence of a comprehensive, effective and nationally coordinated response capability, the hard-earned reputation of sport in this country risks being tarnished, along with a potential reduction in participation rates and a diminution in the social, cultural and economic value of Australia’s significant investment in sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Emerging threats to sport integrity are nothing new. Australia has had its fair share of scandals in elite sport over the years, and each scandal usually brings with it a collective feeling of disappointment and betrayal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some notable examples of scandals in recent history include the controversy in 1994 and 1995 when a bookmaker gave money to Australian cricketers for pitch and weather information; the 2002 Carlton Football Club and 2010 Melbourne Storm salary cap breaches; the 2013 report of the Australian Crime Commission, which reported that organised crime had infiltrated sports, including Rugby League and Australian Rules football, to distribute prohibited substances; also in 2013, the Melbourne Football Club tanking scandal; in 2016, the suspension of 34 Essendon Football Club players over their use of prohibited substances; and, in 2018, ball tampering—the scandal which saw three members of Australia's cricket team suspended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also emerging global threats to integrity in sport that have the potential to affect sport in Australia. To highlight some of these threats to integrity, the Wood review report quoted a 2016 report by Transparency International entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Global Corruption Report: Sport</span>. The report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Referees and athletes can take bribes to fix matches. Club owners can demand kickbacks for player transfers. Companies and governments can rig bids for construction contracts. Organised crime is behind many of the betting scandals that have dented sport's reputation. And money laundering is widespread. This can take place through sponsorship and advertising arrangements. Or it may be through the purchase of clubs, players and image rights. Complex techniques are used to launder money through football and other sports. These include cross-border transfers, tax havens and front companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the sport integrity environment is constantly changing as new threats emerge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was noted in the Wood review that the current threat environment includes growing links between organised crime and sports wagering. Doping in sport continues to be widespread, with almost 2,000 antidoping rule violations recorded by the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2015 across 122 nationalities and 85 sports. As doping detection is becoming more sophisticated, so are the techniques used by athletes to avoid detection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor were in government, we also recognised the constantly evolving sport integrity environment and the need to evaluate and improve upon Australia's sports integrity measures. The review process builds on a couple of important initiatives by the previous Labor government—namely, establishing the National Integrity of Sport Unit in 2012 and strengthening ASADA's powers in 2013. I would like to commend Mr Wood and his panel on an excellent report, which included 52 recommendations for the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government announced a two-stage approach to implementing the recommendations of the Wood review. The first stage is the subject of this bill: bringing together a range of sport integrity functions under one agency, Sport Integrity Australia. The functions that are proposed to be looked after by SIA are currently the responsibility of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority—or ASADA—the National Integrity of Sport Unit and Sport Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Wood review notes, creating SIA will draw together the knowledge and expertise that is brought to bear in defending sport integrity. It will also assist in coordinating all the elements of the response to sport integrity threats, including prevention, monitoring, detection, investigation and enforcement. The second stage would then establish mechanisms to achieve the full suite of sports integrity capabilities proposed by the Wood review. The government, I note, has already started work on part of stage two, as we saw the reforms aimed at enhancing Australia's antidoping capability introduced to parliament at the same time as this bill. That legislation is now before a Senate inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting integrity in sport has bipartisan support, and Labor will continue the bipartisan approach by supporting this bill. I'd like to acknowledge the extensive work done by our shadow minister for sport, Senator Farrell, in informing Labor's position on the bill, including consulting with stakeholders and looking at submissions to the Senate inquiry into the bill. It's only fair to also acknowledge the current minister for sport, Senator Colbeck, and the former minister, Senator McKenzie, for their cooperation in facilitating briefings to the opposition on the Wood review and their response to its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the bill's financial impact statement indicates no net cost to government for this bill. This is because SIA will be funded from existing appropriations which are being spent on the agencies that are currently carrying out its functions. As I said before, this legislation is about ensuring a level playing field for clubs and athletes. It's about ensuring that the benefits of sport and health and social and economic matters are maximised. In a fair sports environment, the success or failure of sports clubs and their athletes should depend on factors such as the community benefits of the club, the dedication of the volunteers and the determination and skill of their athletes. It should not depend on cheating and it should not depend on politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome this legislation, I can't help but be somewhat amused by the use of the words 'sport integrity' in the bill's title given what transpired shortly before the last election. Does both the irony and the hypocrisy go unnoticed by those opposite when they talk about strengthening integrity in sport yet show so little integrity when it comes to their rorting of sports grants programs? As commendable as it is for the government to work to implement the Wood review and to tackle corruption in sport, their sports rorts scandal undermines this effort. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite legislate to tackle corruption in sport while they themselves are engaged in corrupting grant processes. We had the first sports rorts program, the Community Sport Infrastructure grants, where a merit based program was usurped by a political process. Advantage was given to sports clubs not according to the benefits they could deliver for increasing participation in sport or for enriching their local communities, but on politics and geography. And while the original funding recommendations made by Sport Australia were about maximising the social and economic benefits of the funding, the decisions ultimately made by the minister were about maximising the political benefits to the Liberal and National parties. We know this because the member for Nicholls told us. We also know because this was the finding of a comprehensive report of the Auditor-General, a report which, by the way, also found that almost half of the projects were ineligible when they received funding. And it wasn't just the then minister's grubby fingerprints all over the crime scene. The Prime Minister's office and potentially a number of those opposite were involved too—to what extent, we will hopefully learn from the current Senate inquiry. As much as those opposite tried to protest that another report absolves them of the Auditor-General's findings, Mr Gaetjens's report is an absolute sham, and they know it. Those on that side of the chamber know that they cannot rely on a secret report written by the Prime Minister's former chief of staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly though, the Community Sports Infrastructure program wasn't the end of these rorts. After the first sports rorts affair, the government then rolled out the female facilities and water safety program. This was sports rorts version 1 on steroids, with a whopping 40 per cent of the $150-million program going to two marginal electorates. The actions of those opposite in using supposedly merit based sports programs as a political slush fund undermine the good work that this bill and the remaining implementation of the Wood review seeks to do. It's no wonder that so many Australians are feeling bewildered and betrayed by the actions of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do commend the bill to the Senate, but in doing so I implore those opposite, 'Don't speak with a forked tongue.' If you're going to work to ensure integrity in sport, then this needs to extend to sports infrastructure funding too. It's time to come clean about the sports rorts affair, admit it was a rort and promise that a transparent, merit based approach will be taken to future sports infrastructure funding programs. Until the Libs and Nationals come clean about this scandal, it's hard to say that they are taking all aspects of integrity in sport seriously. Having said that, we welcome this bill, and Labor will continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure the establishment and operation of SIA are delivering on the outcomes the agency is tasked with achieving. We will also continue to monitor the government's response to the recommendations of the Wood review. The government's response needs to be as strong as possible to protect the important role that sport plays in the Australian economy, society and our way of life now and into the future.</span>

As has been said in the chamber a number of times, Australians love their sport, and we expect our sport to be clean. When it isn't, it damages the confidence that participants and viewers have in the games they hold close to their hearts. In order to effectively identify and react to escalating risks in sport, it is essential that a cohesive, well-resourced, national-level capability is in place. The government is responding to these risks by cohesively drawing together existing sporting integrity capabilities to establish Sport Integrity Australia, with a focus on policy and program delivery, education, outreach and antidoping monitoring and intelligence. Sport Integrity Australia will be well placed to assist the sporting community prevent and address identified threats in sport.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:32</span>):  Labor will be supporting the Agriculture Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Administration) Bill 2019. The bill seeks to amend laws relating to biosecurity and imported food to provide for streamlined administration through automated, computerised decision-making. The explanatory memorandum states the bill will: allow risk identification and management across a large number of goods and conveyances; reduce the burden on importers by enabling fast, accurate clearance; and provide flexibility in responding to existing and emerging risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the Senate understand that automated, computerised decision-making systems are not new. In 2004 the Administrative Review Council considered the administrative law implications of computerised decision-making. Back then the council concluded that expert systems could assist in administrative decision-making. The explanatory memorandum states that it is intended the principles set out by the Administrative Review Council be taken into account during the implementation of the automated decision-making scheme 'to the extent consistent with maintaining biosecurity and food health and safety standards'. The bill provides discretion for authorised officers to override an electronic decision where satisfied the electronic decision is inconsistent with the objects of the relevant act or another decision is more appropriate in the circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions made by a computer program will be subject to merit and judicial review in the same way as a decision made by an officer under the relevant provision. In the case of the Biosecurity Act, the decision will be taken to have been made by the Director of Biosecurity but not in a personal capacity and as such the matter will be subject to a judicial review in the first instance. The bill provides the Director of Biosecurity with broad powers to arrange for the use of computer programs for any purposes for which a biosecurity officer is required to make a decision under a relevant provision, exercise power related to making a decision or do anything related to exercising a decision-making obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring Australia maintains its world-class biosecurity status is critically important. This bill will assist decision-makers to make timely decisions on biosecurity matters which are simple, frequent, repeatable decisions that have a low biosecurity risk. However, the Morrison government cannot use this bill as an excuse to not properly fund Australia's biosecurity system. The government has failed to even introduce its own biosecurity levy which it announced in the 2018 budget. The budget measure was to raise $325 million over three years, beginning from 1 July 2019. Yet here we are in February 2020, and not one cent has been raised from the levy. This is because the Morrison government has failed to implement the levy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agriculture minister's own department told us how the levy would be spent. But, remember, not one cent has been raised so far. Therefore, either the programs listed below are not being funded or the Morrison government is cutting costs elsewhere in the agriculture department. This is what the Morrison government said it would fund. I'll name the program first and then the amount: assurance verification and enforcement, $34 million—this is over five years; border clearance, including traveller, mail, sea and air cargo pathways, $7½ million; priority pest and disease planning and response, $65.6 million; Indigenous biosecurity rangers program, $33.5 million; biosecurity predictive analytics and intelligence, $36.5 million; emergency response funding, $35 million; Biosecurity Innovation Program, $25.2 million; environmental biosecurity protection, $7.6 million; international sea and airport supplementary funding, especially passengers, $18.1 million; and, for our Tasmanians, the Tasmanian fruit fly, $20 million. Not one cent has been raised!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This third-term government has failed to take our biosecurity systems seriously. Automating a few decisions will not be enough to ensure our biosecurity is the best it can be. The funding of our biosecurity system was a key element of the 2017 independent review into the capacity of Australia's national biosecurity system. The report made 42 recommendations to strengthen our national biosecurity system, but the Morrison government has failed to implement all 42 recommendations. Ensuring that our biosecurity system is properly funded must be a priority for this third-term government. The department of agriculture has seen four different ministers and is up to its third different departmental secretary. This disruption has impacted on the department being able to deliver effective policies to ensure our biosecurity system remains strong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many biosecurity risks that threaten Australia's world-class biosecurity status. All senators will remember the impact of white spot on the Queensland prawn farmers, and African swine flu remains a real threat to our world-class pork industry—and, Senator Colbeck, you and I vividly remember citrus canker. Maintaining Australia's clean, green and safe competitive advantage is critical to our farmers, fishers and foresters. Sadly, the Morrison government continues to fail to develop and implement the biosecurity levy, with another working group being established to co-design and figure out how the levy will work. I'm not making this up. According to the department's website, the new industry working group will determine how the newly-named 'onshore biosecurity levy' will be applied, the appropriate charging points, the scope and the implementation timing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, once again, the government seems to not have learnt its lessons from the past: there is no mineral based product representation on the new committee. It appears that the government will just seek to announce the new levy in the May budget. It is difficult to see how this third-term coalition government will get the levy right this time around, when it couldn't get it right after two years of trying. There are no terms of reference for the new committee, and stakeholders will be concerned as to who will be the target of this new levy. It seems the government just doesn't get that poor consultation will always lead to poor policy design. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this bill is that it will amend the Imported Food Control Act, and I'll talk about that. The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture may arrange for the use of computer programs for any purposes related to issuing of food control certificates; issuing of written advice following an inspection and analysis of food; and decisions regarding the treatment of failing food. The EM states that it is intended that computer programs will be used to issue automated food control certificates for all foods not required to be inspected, with foods requiring inspection continuing to receive a food control certificate from an authorised officer. The secretary must take reasonable steps to ensure consistency of decisions made by computer programs and may delegate the power to arrange for computer programs to make decisions to a senior executive service, or an SES. I reiterate that Labor supports this bill; however, this third-term Liberal-National government will need to do more than just minor amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):  This bill, the Agriculture Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Administration) Bill 2019, amends the Biosecurity Act 2015 and the Imported Food Control Act 1992 to enable computer programs to make decisions and exercise certain powers under those acts. On first inspection, this is not problematic. We Greens, of course, support the use of technology to improve government administration and make it more efficient, when it is done well, particularly if it will lead to genuine improvements in biosecurity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course the devil is in the detail. This is something that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has commented on. The committee noted in its bills digest:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… administrative law typically requires decision makers to engage in an active intellectual process in respect of the decisions they are required or empowered to make. A failure to engage in such a process—for example, where decisions are made by a computer rather than by a person—may lead to legal error. In addition, there are risks that the use of an automated decision-making process may operate as a fetter on discretionary power, by inflexibly applying predetermined criteria to decisions that should be made on the merits of the individual case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know where these automated decision-making processes have come a cropper with this government over recent years. It's the whole robodebt scandal. There are potential concerns with using these automated decision-making processes. They need to be used very carefully indeed. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee also noted concerns about whether provisions in the bill will limit or exclude administrative law requirements which condition the formation of a state of mind—for example, the flexibility rule regarding policy or the requirements of legal reasonableness. A central concern here is how the operation of proposed section 541A(3) will impact requirements of administrative law such as the flexibility rule, or requirements of legal reasonableness that are contingent on the formation of a state of mind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wasn't the only concern that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised. In particular, they also were concerned about the types of decisions that can be made by computer programs and that they would be determined via a legislative instrument rather than the primary legislation. Again, its <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">crutiny </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">igest</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>No. 1 of 2020 states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee's longstanding scrutiny view is that significant matters, such as the decisions suitable for computerised decision-making, should be included in the primary legislation unless a sound justification is provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This may all sound very arcane, but it goes to actually having good decision-making and good transparency in that decision-making. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, while it noted the minister's explanation, made clear that it 'does not generally consider administrative flexibility to be a sufficient justification for including significant matters in delegated legislation'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this pattern of avoiding scrutiny via delegated legislation is all too common from this coalition government. In a recent piece, journalist Karen Middleton summarises that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The federal government is allocating billions of dollars in grants and making significant policy changes in a way that is likely unlawful, legal experts warn, using a mechanism that bypasses parliament and obscures decisions from public view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Australia's most eminent constitutional experts, University of Sydney law professor Anne Twomey, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the legal authority for governing by regulation is increasingly flimsy, in most cases – especially when allocating public money.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does all this matter? It matters because when we have a government that is trying to hide its actions from scrutiny, when it refuses to be transparent, then it is chipping away at our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Karen Middleton cites a number of legal experts highlighting how delegated legislation has been slowly reducing transparency, and that in turn is slowly reducing of ability of citizens to know what their government is doing and it is undermining their trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've spoken earlier today, and over many weeks, about the importance of scrutiny by the Senate and transparency in supporting our democracy. The coalition is still trying to cover up the Gaetjens report of the sports rorts. We are still going to continue to work through the select committee to hold them accountable. These things are connected. Accountability and transparency across all aspects of government are critically important and we need to get it right across all aspects of government, not to just pick and choose where it's convenient for things to be transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main response from the coalition to issues of not being transparent or accountable enough is that, 'Well, the Labor Party does it too.' It's not good enough. It's not good enough to try and pin the blame on a scandal from 20 years ago. We need a transparent approach to grants. We need more transparency, not less. We need reform to our whole system of government accountability. We need an independent commission against corruption that can tackle this issue. The Greens have led the way on this issue, as on so many others. The bill introduced by Senator Waters to introduce an independent corruption commission is ready to be voted on in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to these biosecurity laws, meanwhile we've got the government which is basically fumbling with these minor tweaks to biosecurity laws at the same time as we've got the sports rorts grants program happening, rorting across multiple portfolios and, of course, our country has been burning under the fire emergency and our climate emergency. We've still got no meaningful action on our climate emergency. If you look at the legislation that we've been discussing today, yes, it's all important stuff, but it doesn't go to the key issues that are being faced by our community today. The climate emergency is already impacting on agricultural production and will have far greater ramifications in years to come. It much more important than having these minor changes to biosecurity laws—far greater ramifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just had 11,000 scientists around the world declaring a climate emergency. The magnitude of the problems we face and their impact upon our wellbeing are stark and sobering. Yet what we are debating in this Senate today are these minor tweaks to our biosecurity legislation. We know full well what the world needs to be doing to deal with our climate emergency and that is why the government is trying to keep attention away from it. We know what needs to happen is to replace coal, gas and oil as quickly as possible with renewable energy. We know that it can be done and we know that, frankly, it must be done or the world is going to be a incredibly scary place for our children or grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are debating, and the government is legislating for, changes at the margins which will, yes, maybe have some minor tweaks, some minor impacts, on our agricultural sector, we know that the climate emergency is far more important. We know that it's going to absolutely wipe out any of these minor improvements that these tweaks to our biosecurity legislation are going to bring into being. We're going to have more times spent in drought. We are going to have much more variability in crop yields. We are going to have more frequent and intense heatwaves and extreme weather events. We've got projections that there's going to be a halving of the irrigated agricultural output of the Murray-Darling Basin region, which currently accounts for 50 per cent of our irrigated agricultural output or $7.2 billion a year. What is the government doing with this? Absolutely nothing. The legislation that we are debating today is so minor and inconsequential in comparison. Under four degrees of warming, the climate—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Tonight, before the Senate, in this adjournment speech, I express some significant and deep concerns for the provision of health services to people in regional communities across Australia. There are communities that have been affected by the Morrison government's recent changes to the classification of rural, remote and metropolitan areas, and the effects are certainly coming home to roost in my home state of WA. These changes mean that many communities in regional areas will now be classified as metropolitan. This impacts on the ability of GPs to bulk-bill and on incentives to recruit general practitioners to regional communities. It should be of concern, to our nation and to senators here, to know that these changes have meant that the rate of bulk-billing in these communities has declined by some 34 per cent. These changes put at risk the practice of bulk-billing, which a great many GPs do for children and pensioners. Many of the areas affected are low-income areas. GP clinics have said that these changes will force them to stop the practice of bulk-billing or in some cases—most horrifyingly—to close completely. And in some of these communities there are no alternative general practice clinics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, in raising these concerns about the government's changes to bulk-billing and GP incentives, I highlight the concerns for the Mandurah and Pinjarra communities in the Peel region of Western Australia. Anyone who knows the Peel region knows that the Peel is not Perth. The communities of Peel are fiercely regional, and they very much have a regional character in terms of their access to services. They're not communities that have the same access to services as Perth's metropolitan area does. For example, Pinjarra is an hour's drive away from the closest tertiary hospital—it will take you two hours to get there by public transport—and it is some 20 minutes drive from the nearest emergency department. I'm horrified to see that these changes have meant that a GP practice in the town is at risk of closing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone living in regional communities will know the importance of their local GP. They're almost part of your family. They know you. They know your relatives, your friends. They know almost everything about you. You share some of the most frightening moments of your life with them and you share some of the best moments of your life with them. They are integral members of the community. When you're faced with the loss of a person like that, a community resource, you are understandably going to be significantly upset. One of those community members, Vena, whose local GP is in Pinjarra, has said that the stress of losing her local GP could only further impact on the deterioration of her health. She has shared that this GP practice is vital to her and to the local community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the community that benefits from these arrangements. Doctors who are training to be GPs also benefit from practising in regional areas. Sonia Miller, who is the WA General Practice Education and Training chief program officer, has said to the ABC in relation to these changes:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Working as a GP in training in Nedlands is very different to working as a GP in training in Peel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Training in regional communities like the Peel region south of Perth gives these doctors a really good training environment. They're exposed to people from all walks of life—something that Nedlands certainly does not emulate. The problem is that these changes to bulk-billing incentives mean that these regions are at risk of losing these registrars. I understand that this is based on new data about better targeting health services in our regional and remote communities; however, what we need to understand in this place is that Medicare data shows that bulk-billing in regional, rural and remote areas is falling, so moves like this are absolutely counterproductive. I want to know if the government has considered the needs of these communities when making these changes, because it's abundantly clear to me that they have not. These communities have not been consulted before these changes have been made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue is that this is not the first time under this government that the Peel region has been given the rough end of the stick when it comes to being considered a metropolitan area. The region has not been eligible for grants under the Building Better Regions Fund, meaning these communities are missing out on potential funding for much-needed infrastructure. Places like Pinjarra are, in fact, small country towns. They have lower incomes per household. But where has the local member, Mr Andrew Hastie, been when it comes to these issues? Each time the Peel region has been excluded or penalised by this government, one of their own, Mr Andrew Hastie, as the member for Canning, has said he would work with the community to fix this. He has not fixed any of these problems. His voice has not been heard on these bulk-billing problems. He has not fixed the regional recognition for the Peel region when it comes to infrastructure funding. Peel is sick of being treated like Perth's poor cousin by this Morrison government. I call on the government to stand up for Medicare and regional health services, which they are failing to do. It is only the Labor Party that has the capacity and the commitment to stand up for Medicare and regional health services.</span>
