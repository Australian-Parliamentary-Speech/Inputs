              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0Q" type="OfficeSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  Senators, when parliament resumed in August this year, we discussed certain events in June and committed to reflecting our better selves in this place, and the aspirations of those we represent rather than sliding into abuse. One of the things I said at the time was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is far better that positive attention is attracted by our words and contributions to debate. On several occasions in recent times, this has not been the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a chamber, we did not meet this standard yesterday. I state again, unparliamentary offensive epithets and abuse have no place in this chamber. This is rightly a place of vigorous debate, but personal abuse has no place, particularly if it targets personal attributes, such as race or gender—nor does the use of abusive epithets or labels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will use every authority granted to me by the Senate when I personally hear such abuse, or when it is brought to my attention. But this is not just a matter of rules. This is a matter of respect. Of each other, of the institution and of those who elected us and in whose interests and names we act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate what I said yesterday, and it's a simple principle of decency that we should all aspire to reflect. Every senator should reflect not just on what they think they're saying but on how it may be received or interpreted by another with a different life experience or perspective than yourself. We need to lead by example. For if we cannot debate and act civilly in this chamber then how can we expect people outside the chamber to debate and argue and disagree in a respectful manner as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will make this important point to all Australians, that while none of us here are perfect—I certainly am not—the overwhelming majority of time in this Senate does meet this test. The overwhelming majority of senators always aspire to represent the best interests and act accordingly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, to the specific matter of conducting Senate business. A number of proposals have been considered to deal with what has become, frankly, the most unedifying period of the Senate day, general business. What was once a time to deal with matters that didn't require debate or amendment has become a pseudodebate where senators are required to vote on matters without an opportunity for discussion. What was once non-contentious is now the most combative business period. It isn't serving its purpose and is rapidly cascading into farce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a means of dealing with this, I have asked the Deputy President and Procedure Committee to bring forward a temporary order that would remove the ability to debate a proposed suspension of standing orders to enable the Senate to deal with a motion if leave to do so is denied. The effect of this is simply that if formality for a motion is denied, and a suspension of standing orders is moved to ensure the motion can be dealt with, there will be no debate on that procedural motion. Obviously whether this is adopted is of course a matter for the chamber itself. I thank senators.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:34</span>):  by leave—Mr President, the government supports your statement and your actions in the chamber yesterday. In supporting your statement let me also reflect that ours is a chamber in which of course we engage in the battle of ideas on behalf of the communities, states and people we represent, and at times that debate can become quite robust, but there is always a requirement and a responsibility on all of us to engage in the debate in a way that is appropriately robust but also appropriately respectful. It is true that in recent times we're getting to that point of the cycle where tensions increase somewhat in the natural course of events, but it is very important for all of us to remind ourselves of the standards that people expect us to observe as we engage in important business as an important part of our parliamentary democracy. My point of view is that I have always sought to engage willingly but also very respectfully in the debates that we inevitably enter into, and I think it is incumbent on all senators to engage in those debates in the same spirit. From the government's point of view we also will consider any proposals that will come forward through the Procedure Committee to improve what has become an increasingly contentious part of Senate business during the day, and I think that the proposition that you've put forward has a lot of merit.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  by leave—Ultimately this debate is about what sort of place we want this Senate to be. This is a great institution of the Australian democracy and it is incumbent upon all of us to live up to that standard. The approach Labor took yesterday is very clear: we will not tolerate sexist and abusive behaviour. We will not tolerate it in the Senate and we will not tolerate it anywhere. We also believe parliament cannot function without the respect for the presiding officers and the rules that parliament has agreed to regarding appropriate behaviour. But I make this point: the Senate itself will not be respected if the behaviours exhibited in here demean it. That goes not only to rules but also to standards and expectations. The people of Australia who elect us want to see us interacting with each other as adult human beings. We on this side of the chamber recognise that this is a place of robust debate. We have a battle of ideas in this chamber. The battle of ideas can be robust, but it can be respectful of each other and of this place. There must be a distinction drawn between what is acceptable argument and what are personal smears and innuendo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw those expectations trashed yesterday by Senator O'Sullivan—and he is not the first person in this chamber to do so—by his engaging in deliberately offensive personal remarks. The community rightly expects a higher standard of debate than to make insinuations of a personal character. Such personal comments, including references—oblique or otherwise—to people's personal lives, should always be off limits. This has been long recognised not only in our standing orders but also in the standards of behaviour we expect of each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the treatment of women in this place there are some who should particularly reflect on their actions and words. I ask them to consider whether their partners, wives or daughters would permit themselves to be treated in such an offensive way. The shaming of women has been used for decades, even centuries, as a tool of control by those in power. It is odious behaviour. It has never been appropriate and it is not acceptable in this place. To use a sporting analogy: play the ball, not the man or woman. There are some people in this place who I believe need to find a map and compass about how to conduct themselves in a debate—and in other fora, including committee hearings—without going after women personally. Our colleagues and our daughters deserve no less. Mr President, I indicate the opposition's support of the approach you have flagged in relation to the discovery process.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  by leave—It is not my intention to disrespect the Senate or its processes. I have great respect for this institution. It is one of the honours of my life to be standing here representing the people of my home state and leading the Australian Greens. It is a privilege and an honour to do it, and I reflect on that every day. This is a place where all of us can help shape the nature of our society. Indeed, we can be a force for good. Mr President, that's why I couldn't withdraw my statement yesterday—because the repeated shaming and innuendo directed not just across at this side of the chamber but directed right across the Senate is reinforcing a culture of workplace harassment and the open harassment of women in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia does have a deep and disturbing problem of violence against women. I remember Malcolm Turnbull the former Prime Minister saying that not all disrespect towards women leads to violence but that's where all violence against women starts. We in this place should be setting an example for the nation, and yet this, one of the most powerful institutions of the country, allows men to openly and brazenly shame, insult and harass female members of parliament, and it reinforces that culture that will lead to 72 women being murdered by their partners this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abuse against women is everyone's business. All of us have a role to play in that. There is a great reckoning going on in our society, where all of us are reflecting on our behaviours in the past and are trying to do what we can to help lead the change we need to see in our society. As men, we have been perpetrators. We have been responsible for creating that culture, and that's why it is up to men to make a stand and to call it out. We must no longer tolerate workplace harassment in this chamber. It must stop. There has been a repeated pattern from a small number of men in this chamber who, either through whispers or, sometimes, on the record, make the most demeaning and insulting comments directed against many of my colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this was raised some time ago and you made your statement, Mr President, I had a conversation with Senator Sarah Hanson-Young that forced me to reflect on my own role in this—that I'd not stood up, that I'd stayed silent, that I'd assumed this was just part of what it means to be a senator in this place. I apologised to Senator Hanson-Young and I said that I would now stand up and call it out whenever I heard it, that she would not be alone. And yet, despite your statement—a very welcome statement, Mr President—this behaviour continues. They do it over and over and over again. Sometimes you don't hear it, but we do. Sometimes they put it on the record—it's deliberate; it's calculated—then they withdraw it. But those words can never be taken back. They hurt and they damage. That's why yesterday I made the statement I did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give some context to what happened yesterday. The day before, I approached the Deputy President of the Senate because that behaviour that occurred yesterday had occurred the day before and on the back of months of a pattern of behaviour. I indicated to the Deputy President that I would be writing to you, Mr President, to inform you that, when a senator yells across the chamber to a female colleague, 'Go and have a cry,' because they don't like what they're hearing, that's unacceptable. It would be unacceptable in a classroom, it would be unacceptable on the factory floor, it would be unacceptable in a business and it's unacceptable in the Senate. Yesterday Senator O'Sullivan used words that were designed to hurt and humiliate a fellow colleague. The day before, other senators in this place used words that were aggressive and threatening. I want to thank Senator O'Neill for standing up and calling them out when she heard them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for us now as a chamber is: are words enough? Is a call to people in this place to lift the standard of behaviour enough? I don't think it is, Mr President, because we've heard it time and time again. When in September 2017 Senator Hanson wore a burqa into this Senate I sought for the Senate to adopt a code of conduct that would prevent this offensive and harmful behaviour. In August this year, following a horrific first speech, again I sought to have a code of conduct adopted, and it was rejected by both the government and the opposition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current rules are not working. We are allowing harassment and we are allowing women to be demeaned in this chamber. They stand on all sides of the chamber, but predominantly they are those people who are walking out right now. They aren't strong enough. They simply cannot hear the truth. They are the cowards here. It's very clear that, despite your words this morning, Mr President, they take no heed of the call to all of us to improve the standards in this place. The men who use sexism to belittle or intimidate women should not be tolerated in any society and they most certainly should not be tolerated in the Australian Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, we accept your recommendation in terms of the way we will handle the discovery of formal business, but we need to do more than that. We need to ensure that there are strong rules and a strong code of conduct that does not allow this offensive behaviour to continue.</span>
              </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of this bill. It has been the subject of a fair amount of discussion between the minister's office and ours. I just want to be clear that I am speaking to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and the following bill, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018, have their origins in the Mabo decision of 1992, which recognised that terra nullius was a myth and that traditional title to land, custom and law had survived in many parts of Australia. It also found that, to our great sorrow—that is, the First Nations people's great sorrow—native title had been legally extinguished by the actions of successive Australian governments in many parts of Australia. In response, the Keating government established the Native Title Act, which defines native title and establishes a process for its recognition in the places that could prove that there had been no extinguishment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The land fund, now officially known as the land account, was the second part of the negotiated agreement. The land account sets up a mechanism for compensation for the dispossession of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples since 1788. It sets up a new statutory authority created at the same time as the land account. The Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, has used the land account to purchase property for the use and enjoyment of Indigenous Australians whose native title has been legally extinguished. In 2018, the government, after a review period, introduced two substantive pieces of legislation and one piece of consequential legislation to alter the functions and governance of the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Indigenous land account. These are the bills in front of us today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first bill gives the ILC functions in relation to water related rights. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations can acquire rights to water. Assistance can be provided to acquire water based rights. Management actions can be taken on Indigenous waters, and assistance can be provided for those management functions. In other words, what the ILC could previously do on land it can now carry out on Indigenous owned and managed areas of water. It is important to understand that what was previously recognised as land rights has evolved in recent times to include sea rights. Those of us who are from the saltwater country have rights, responsibilities and commitments to care for the areas of salt water and fresh water that form our traditional lands and country. For example, the Yawuru people in my part of the world have management plans in place that support our traditional use of resources along the coast and in the waters of Roebuck Bay. It is timely that our roles to protect and manage our saltwater country should be recognised and supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not create any new rights, and the ILC, the Indigenous Land Corporation, is still required to exercise its functions in a manner that is consistent with the rights and interests of other persons or international law. The bill does allow for the change of the name of the ILC to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation, to better reflect the expansion of its functions. The ILC has conducted extensive stakeholder consultations in relation to changing its remit. According to their consultation report summary, there was overwhelming support for change from those participants. Labor supports the intention of this legislation. We support the expansion of the remit of the fund to cover water and support native title holders to exercise these rights. We support this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. The Indigenous Land Corporation, as was just articulated, was established in 1995 following the Mabo No. 2 High Court decision and assists First Nations peoples to acquire and manage land for the benefit of First Nations people. The bill amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 to expand the remit of the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, to include water related rights to enable it to support First Nations people to care for, manage and benefit from freshwater and sea country, something the Australian Greens very strongly support. The establishment of the ILC's remit beyond land based activities is consistent with the developments in native title case law and is something which, through various inquiries, we've heard many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples call for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ILC held consultations in the second half of last year with First Nations peoples across Australia about the potential for the expansion of its remit to include functions relating to waters. The majority of those consulted supported these reforms. This bill will also amend the name of the Indigenous Land Corporation, which will become the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation, consistent with the expansion of the Indigenous Land Corporation's functions. The Australian Greens support the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the committee inquiry into the provisions of this bill—and the other two that are coming on, one of which we'll be debating next—it became apparent that the bill failed to give the Indigenous Land Corporation management functions of all waters for which it has water related rights. The Australian Greens are pleased to see that the bill was amended in the House of Representatives to rectify this omission in line with recommendation 1 of the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill and the additional comments from the Australian Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting this bill. We think it's a very important progression of the role of what will soon become the former ILC and it's something that, as I said earlier, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have been calling for.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCULLION</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  I thank senators for their contribution to this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. This bill represents a significant step forward in Australia's land rights journey. I'm immensely proud that the government has brought forward this legislation. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established as part of the government's response to the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to acquire land and manage Indigenous-held land to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is in recognition that many Indigenous people will be unable to benefit under the Native Title Act 1993, principally through dispossession not allowing them to be able to demonstrate continued connection with country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Developments in native title case law following the establishment of the Indigenous Land Corporation have clarified that common law is capable of recognising native title rights in relation to water. These developments in the law acknowledged that, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, land and water are inseparable parts of country. Whenever I was able to be with Aboriginal people, wherever I was, there was a notion, from my very earliest connection, of sea country or saltwater country and saltwater people. That very strong connection wasn't reflected in a Westminster approach to the sea or the ocean particularly. The Westminster system said that it ended at the high-water mark and whatever was seaward of that was common property, or some notion of the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 to extend the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to include all of those water related rights. It allows the Indigenous Land Corporation to acquire and divest water related rights to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations in the same way that it currently is able to acquire and divest land. The bill also enables the Indigenous Land Corporation to carry out management activities in relation to Indigenous water or waters in which the Indigenous Land Corporation has water related rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill further enables the Indigenous Land Corporation to provide assistance in the form of grants, loans and guarantees for the purpose of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters. In the same way as the ILC can acquire a property—invariably because that property could never be acquired through the native title process, because of dispossession—it can also acquire and take interest in, for example, fishing rights. If you're going to use a pastoral lease, you need to keep the cows in one place, so you need infrastructure like fences or yards. In the same way, if you want to manage, utilise or harvest fish, you need jetties, boats and those sorts of things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also renames the Indigenous Land Corporation the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of its remit now to include saltwater and freshwater country. These reforms follow extensive consultation with Indigenous stakeholders. A clear majority of stakeholders support these changes to expand the remit to include freshwater and saltwater country. We've listened and we've acted. By expanding the roles of the Indigenous Land Corporation, this government is realising its commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I thank senators for their contributions and for their assistance in formulating this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I rise to speak to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018 and related bill. The bills establish a financial asset fund, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund, to support additional payments to the ILC, the Indigenous Land Corporation. I think it'll be called the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation now. The fund will replace the Indigenous land account. Funds currently allocated will be managed by the Future Fund's board. The fund will be credited with amounts equal to the balance of the land account's special account and the value of the investment of the land account. The fund's special account will then be debited to provide an annual payment to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to be credited to and paid from the ILC funding special account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The finance minister and Indigenous affairs minister may also determine, once in a financial year, that an additional payment is to be made to the ILC after considering the advice of the Future Fund's board about the impact of any additional payments on the sustainability of annual payments to the ILC. The Future Fund board will be responsible for deciding how to invest the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to make annual payments or any additional payments to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 requires the responsible ministers to issue an investment mandate to the Future Fund's board regarding the investment of the Future Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the investment mandate is to provide a mechanism for the government to provide strategic guidance to the Future Fund board on its expectations for the investment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund. The Indigenous land account has achieved an average return over the past three years of approximately CPI plus 1.5 per cent per annum. Under the new arrangements, the government expects that the account will achieve a return of CPI plus 2.6 per cent after fees. Some would say that's quite a substantial increase. The expenses associated with the investment and administration of the fund incurred by the Future Fund will be met out of the fund itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's position is to support the intent of this legislation, and we accept the need to improve the financial sustainability of the fund. However, after consultations with stakeholders, we took the view that there are a number of ways in which the legislation could be strengthened in order to protect the land fund for future generations, so we have requested a number of minor amendments to the bill which we believe will help achieve this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, we have requested of the government that they include provisions in the bill so that the minister must have regard to the sustainability of the fund prior to making any additional transfers. This will help ensure that these transfers are not used to deplete the fund over time. We also requested that the long-term sustainability be a necessary consideration when the minister sets the investment mandate. I am pleased that the government will be soon moving amendments to address both these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second concern relates to the removal of an oversight role for the ILC in relation to the fund. At present, the ILC Board provides oversight of this account. This is not an active oversight role but, rather, a way for the ILC board to maintain a clear line of sight as to how the account is being invested. The bill before us in its original form removed this. We did not support this. At a time when there are growing calls for a greater Indigenous say over issues that impact their lives, we felt the removal of the oversight was inconsistent with the need to maintain as much Indigenous involvement as possible. However, we welcome the government's decision to require the Future Fund to brief the ILC Board on the fund's investment decisions, restoring that important oversight for the ILC. We note that this will be an active oversight role that is not designed to interfere with the functions of the Future Fund board but, rather, to ensure that the fund, which is designed to assist Indigenous Australians, is never removed entirely from Indigenous involvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also welcome the amendment that requires the minister to consult with the ILC in relation to the investment mandate. This, once again, provides an opportunity for important input from Indigenous Australians into the management of the fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe these amendments strengthen the bill and we thank the minister for working with us to achieve a bipartisan position. Having reached agreements on these matters, we will support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. As previously stated, the Indigenous Land Corporation was established in 1995 following the Mabo High Court decision and assists First Nations peoples to acquire and manage land for the benefit of First Nations peoples. Funding to achieve this comes from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account, to be referred to as the land account, in the form of an annual CPI-indexed payment to the Indigenous Land Corporation. Currently, an additional automatic payment is also made from the land account to the Indigenous Land Corporation when the capital of the land account exceeds a CPI-indexed target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the restrictions on the investment mandate of the land account to cash and cash-like products, it is not generating sufficient investment returns to ensure the financial sustainability of the Indigenous Land Corporation into the future. In the previous four financial years, the land account has not met its target rate of return. The Murray panel, which, in 2016, was tasked with providing advice on options to ensure the sustainability of the land account, recommended the Future Fund Board of Guardians invest the funds of the land account. In the previous parliament the Greens had a bill to make amendments to the Indigenous Land Corporation act. As part of the inquiry into our proposed reforms, this very issue of the investments of the land account was brought up. One of the recommendations made during that inquiry—even though it was not part of my bill—was that the land account should be managed in an alternative way. Suggestions were made around incorporating the Future Fund. At the time, those suggestions were not taken up by government, so it is pleasing to see that action has now been taken. It was in fact pleasing to see that the Murray review was undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 establishes the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund, to be referred to as the Land and Sea Future Fund. It is an investment fund that will replace the land account, but will serve the same purpose—namely, to fund the activities of what is now the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation. The Future Fund Board of Guardians will oversee the investment of the Land and Sea Future Fund, in line with a recommendation of the Murray panel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consultation I mentioned during debate on the previous bill regarding the expansion of the Indigenous Land Corporation's remit also measured support for improving the sustainability of the land account by transferring the investment function of the land account to the Future Fund Board of Guardians and by broadening the range of financial assets that the funds could be invested in. Again a majority of those consulted supported this reform. The intention is for the Land and Sea Future Fund to have a broader investment mandate that should see more sustainable returns produced and see annual payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation continue without the current concern of slowly depleting the land account. The Land and Sea Future Fund will receive the money and financial assets of the land account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill requires that an annual indexed payment be made to the Indigenous Land Corporation as is currently the case. The bill also provides for one discretionary additional payment per financial year if determined by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs after considering the advice of the Future Fund Board of Guardians regarding the impact this payment will have on the sustainability of annual payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation. The investment mandate will be set by the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer in consultation with the Minister for Indigenous Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens expressed our in-principle support for the bill during the inquiry. However, in our quite substantive additional comments to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill and the previous bills, we indicated that we had a number of concerns. One of the concerns we raised was in relation to reporting requirements. We said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There needs to be certainty that reports will be available at regular intervals that illustrate the performance of the ATSILSFF, rather than reliance placed on the Minister for Finance to request such reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our concerns regarding this have been alleviated by the knowledge that the Future Fund Board of Guardians is required to report each quarter to the Minister for Finance on the performance outcomes of the funds they are managing and that these reports are published on the Future Fund's website. We have also become aware that, following the 10-year review of the legislation, there is no requirement that the review be made public or tabled in parliament. I hope the government can address this and make some commitments around that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pleased to see that a number of amendments were made in the House of Representatives to strengthen the bill further. We are pleased to see that sustainability of the annual payments from the Land and Sea Future Fund to the Indigenous Land Corporation has been further highlighted as a key concept through the requirement that this sustainability be taken into account when the investment mandate is being set and when a determination is being made regarding a discretionary additional payment to the Indigenous Land Corporation. It is also appropriate that the Indigenous Land Corporation Board be consulted on the setting of the investment mandate and that they are able to meet with Commonwealth officials regarding a quarterly performance report relating to the Land and Sea Future Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018 makes consequential amendments to other acts that are affected by the establishment of the Land and Sea Future Fund. This includes repealing the sections of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 that create the land account and amending the legislation governing the Future Fund and other funds managed by the Future Fund Management Agency. It also includes minor technical amendments relating to the renaming of the Indigenous Land Corporation to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation, contingent on the passage of the previous legislation. The Greens thank the minister for the additional information that was provided by him and his office. We are pleased to see amendments and we will be supporting these bills.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. These bills represent an historic moment in Australia's land rights journey. The legislation gives effect to the government's decision to establish a dedicated financial asset fund, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund, to support the making of annual and discretionary additional payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation. The government wishes to invest in financial assets with the aim of achieving investment returns to support the Indigenous Land Corporation financially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Land Corporation was established as part of the government's response to the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to acquire and manage Indigenous-held land, to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is in recognition that many people would be unable to benefit under the Native Title Act 1993. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund will replace the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account. The legislation provides for the transfer of moneys and financial assets currently allocated to the land account to the new fund, managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Future Fund board is an experienced, specialised and trusted sovereign investor, responsible for investing over $180 billion—as at 30 September this year—across five sovereign wealth funds with different purposes and different investment mandates. As at 31 October 2018 the land account held a capital balance of $2 billion. However, a combination of the current investment environment, payment arrangements and investment restrictions means that the land account is not financially sustainable. Those arrangements make it all but impossible for the land account to sustain annual indexed payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation. These bills propose landmark changes to address this. Annual payments will be channelled to the Indigenous Land Corporation from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund. The finance minister and the Indigenous affairs minister may determine, once in a financial year, that an additional payment be made to the Indigenous Land Corporation, after considering the advice of the Future Fund board about the impact of such payments on the sustainability of annual payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation requires the responsible ministers to issue an investment mandate to the Future Fund board regarding the investment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund. The purpose of the investment mandate is to provide a mechanism for the government to provide strategic guidance to the Future Fund board on its expectations for the investment of these funds. The legislation mandates consultation with the Indigenous Land Corporation, through the Indigenous affairs minister, on the actual setting of the investment mandate. This requirement acknowledges the interest of the Indigenous Land Corporation in the performance of the fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Fund Board of Guardians is required to prepare an annual report about the performance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund. The finance minister may also request additional information from the Future Fund board about the management of the fund. These reporting arrangements are consistent with arrangements for other funds currently managed by the Future Fund board. In addition, the Future Fund Board of Guardians publishes a quarterly report on each of the funds under management. The legislation gives the Indigenous Land Corporation board the opportunity to discuss the performance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund with Commonwealth officials if it so desires and following the publishing of a quarterly update for the fund. This recognises that the fund is the primary source of funding for the Indigenous Land Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sustainability of annual payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation is a key concept underpinning the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund. This is reflected in provisions dealing with the channelling of discretionary additional payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation and setting of the investment mandate for the fund. The concept of sustainability of annual payments captures the intention of government that the fund is established to provide a source of funding to the Indigenous Land Corporation over the longer term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to Senator Siewert's concern about the tabling of any reviews: the legislation requires, as the senator indicated, a review of the operation of these arrangements to be undertaken after 10 years. It is the government's intention that the report of the review will be tabled in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders have expressed overwhelming support for these reforms. From July to September 2017 the ILC conducted public consultations on the financial sustainability of the land account. Multiple meetings were held, in 11 locations across Australia, involving 75 Indigenous organisations. The Indigenous Land Corporation also invited written submissions from stakeholder groups and individuals. A clear majority of stakeholders supported changes to improve the sustainability of the land account by allowing land account funds to be invested in a wider range of investment products and to be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has listened and acted by introducing these groundbreaking reforms. Securing sustainable funding arrangements for the Indigenous Land Corporation will allow the Indigenous Land Corporation to continue to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to achieve their economic, environmental, social and cultural goals into the future. This government is giving practical effect to its commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I thank the Senate and parliament for their input and the amendments that have been discussed already in a multipartisan way around the parliament, and I commend the bills.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I rise to speak to the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018. Labor will be supporting this bill because it makes a number of improvements to the existing regime for protecting the rights of artists and others whose livelihoods depend on them being paid for what they create, whether that's music, movies, television programs, books or any other form of intellectual property. Labor supports this bill because it will strengthen the current regime under which a court can make orders blocking access to websites that have the primary purpose or the primary effect of infringing copyright.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note, however, that we have been disappointed at the way the government initially handled this bill, which led to some stakeholders telling us that they were not adequately consulted or given the chance to enter meaningful dialogue with the government on the final version of the bill. To allow stakeholders with concerns about the changes to the site-blocking regime being made by this bill to be properly heard and their concerns considered, earlier this month Labor supported a crossbench motion for an inquiry into this bill by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee. The referral to the committee was made on 13 November 2018. The committee then advertised the inquiry on its website and wrote to relevant individuals and organisations inviting submissions. The committee did not hold a public hearing, but committee members carefully examined the 26 submissions received. I thank submitters for taking the time to write to the committee and I thank the committee members for their diligent work in reviewing those submissions and preparing a report, which was tabled on 26 November.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report details the concerns raised by some submitters and provides comprehensive responses to those concerned. Ultimately, the committee made the following two recommendations:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recommendation 1</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2.48 The committee recommends that the government review the effectiveness of the measures contained in the bill two years after its enactment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recommendation 2</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2.49 The committee recommends that the Senate pass the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor accepts both recommendations. We understand that the government has committed to review the effectiveness of the measures contained in the bill two years after its enactment, in accordance with the committee's first recommendation. Labor welcomes that commitment and will take this opportunity to say that, if there is a change of government at the next election, a Shorten Labor government would also carry out that recommendation and review the effectiveness of the measures contained in the bill after its enactment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to what this bill will achieve. While the digital revolution has created enormous benefits for our society and economy, it has also been highly disruptive. The rapid expansion of online services has created many new challenges for law enforcement. But we in Labor do not believe the online world should be allowed to exist in a lawless frontier. To the contrary, we in Labor understand the importance of effective regulation in this area, whether it's to stop the selling of illegal weapons, to shut down the vile trade in child pornography, to prevent online radicalisation of Australians by terrorist groups or, as this bill does, to prevent the theft of intellectual property. This bill makes important improvements to the Copyright Act that will help ensure it continues to protect intellectual property rights in the digital age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Labor recognise the vital importance of Australia's creative industries. Our musicians, our filmmakers, our television production industry and our artists all contribute enormously to our society in both economic and cultural terms. The stories Australians love the most are our stories—stories about our nation, our history, our people. Whether on television, on the big screen or in books, these stories are all produced by people who rely on copyright laws to protect their creative work. It is the copyright law that ensures those in our creative industry are paid for the work that they do. Chapter 9 of the Australian Labor Party's National Platform is titled 'A fair go for all'. At paragraph 300, the ALP sets out the importance of maintaining copyright in the following terms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legal framework of copyright is necessary to ensure the income generated by arts, culture and heritage is fairly distributed between the creators and the institutions and entrepreneurs who make it available.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When last in government and over the last five years of opposition, Labor has been working to support sensible changes to our copyright laws to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in protecting our creative industries and our artists. One of the most significant threats to the music and screen industries since the advent of the internet has been the rise of online piracy, because online piracy undermines the capacity of creators, including musicians and screen industry professionals, to sell their work. To help reduce online piracy, in 2015 Labor worked with the government to introduce amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 that allow the courts to issue site-blocking orders that oblige carriage service providers to block access to identified pirate sites. These site-blocking injunctions can only be issued by a judge and only for websites outside of Australia whose primary purpose has been proven to be infringing copyright material. This regime, under section 115A of the Copyright Act, is necessary because many pirate sites operate in overseas jurisdictions with lax copyright laws. The pirate sites operating in these foreign jurisdictions are generally out of reach of Australian law enforcement, yet the damage these sites do to our creative industries and so to our economy is considerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Representatives of our creative industries and artists in Australia were very supportive of the regime introduced by section 115A, and since 2015 these reforms have been successfully used to block a number of pirate sites, with a measurable drop in the rate of online copyright infringements in Australia. However, rates of online copyright infringement in Australia remain high in contrast to comparable overseas jurisdictions and new forms of copyright infringement are always being developed as the digital world rapidly changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill responds to the ongoing challenge of online piracy by strengthening the site-blocking regime in section 115A of the Copyright Act. In summary, it will expand the services that can be subject to injunctions to include online search engine providers such as Google, in addition to carriage service providers such as Telstra, to compel the providers to take reasonable steps to not provide search results that direct users to copyright infringing websites. This measure is intended to reinforce the regime by ensuring that searches do not provide easy pathways to copyright infringing websites or to already blocked copyright infringing sites through alternative pathways and web addresses. It allows injunctions to be sought to block access to sites which have the primary purpose or primary effect of infringing or facilitating the infringement of copyright. This is a significant expansion of the scope of the site-blocking scheme, which has been limited to sites with the primary purpose only of infringing copyright. Stakeholders had been concerned that new websites such as cyberlocker sites are frequently used for copyright infringement through file sharing of music, movies and television shows, but it is difficult to prove that they exist for that purpose or that primary purpose, so they would fall outside the scheme. It is expected that the addition of a primary effects test will bring such sites within the scheme without unduly widening its scope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also allow the court to issue more flexible injunctions that can be adopted to maintain a blocking order without the application having to return to court for a new injunction when pirate sites change address or access pathways. These adaptable injunctions will provide for the blocking of additional domain sites, IP addresses and search results by agreement with the copyright owners and service providers. This bill also helps to avoid wasteful and difficult evidentiary inquiries for applicants to establish the location of web hosting sites by putting in place a rebuttable presumption that an online location is outside Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill includes a measure that will enable the minister, by disallowable instrument, to declare that particular onsite search engine providers or a class of those providers are exempted from the scheme. This last measure is essentially a safeguard to ensure that injunctions are directed only against the largest service providers facilitating the infringement of copyright.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creative industry representatives in Australia that Labor has been consulting have already indicated support for the changes proposed in this bill. This includes our music and screen production industries. We know that the search engine providers have been actively involved in the battle against online piracy, and we trust that they will continue that battle. Although some companies and individuals have expressed concerns about the potential of this bill to be used inappropriately to shut down legitimate sites, we in Labor are satisfied that it contains sufficient safeguards to prevent its misuse. In particular, I point out that injunctions can only be issued in narrow circumstances by a Federal Court judge, with the onus of proof on the applicant seeking the injunction. In making a decision about whether to issue a site-blocking injunction, the judge must take into account a wide range of factors. Under subsection (5) of section 115A of the Copyright Act, the court may take the following matters, among others, into account:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with all new legislative regimes, we in Labor are always ready to hear feedback from affected and interested parties about the way in which the regime is operating. If there are any unforeseen problems with the way in which the modifications to section 115A operate in practice, we will of course be willing to consider whether further changes should be made to that part of the Copyright Act to ensure it operates efficiently and effectively to reduce online piracy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Labor are pleased that the protection of copyright is an area of bipartisan agreement. In the past, we have been concerned by some of the government's ill-considered announcements on policies that would roll back copyright protections, such as in relation to safe-harbour laws. However, Labor has stood with Australia's creative industries in opposition to the government's reckless plans to diminish copyright protections, and we were pleased to see that the government backed down on those proposals. Labor is pleased to see that the government has come around to understanding the importance of regulating to protect the rights of our artists and the economic viability and cultural values of our creative industries in the digital age. We support this bill as a means to further the importance of these objectives.</span>

In doing so, we'd like to make clear that we are strongly supportive of both creative and innovative industries in Australia. We recognise that these fields are increasingly overlapping as digital distribution becomes more and more prevalent, and this has created both opportunities and risks for creators and service providers alike. We will continue to work to ensure that the interests of both innovative and creative industries are protected. We do not believe that these things are mutually exclusive. These two industries are fundamental to our future as a country, and, the more we work to support and create protections, the more we are investing in jobs, particularly for young Australians into the future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We suggest, in support of this bill, as we have contended in the past, that site blocking is not the most effective way of stopping piracy. Rather, copyright is most effectively addressed by making content available conveniently, affordably, and in a timely way. We have seen this happen with great effect with the popularity of Netflix in Australia and its subsequent downward influence on piracy rates. We acknowledge that, whilst the bill is intended to address doubts within the current scheme, unintended consequences of extending website blocking practices are a concern. And we will work to ensure that free speech and public discourse are not unduly affected.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank the Senate for supporting the referral of this bill, the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018, to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee. I'm aware that some did not wish to see a delay in the passage of the bill, and I appreciate that the bill has been subject to some consultation in the past. However, my office was contacted by multiple stakeholders on this matter, and Centre Alliance felt it was inappropriate to proceed until all stakeholders had an opportunity to express their concerns as part of the short inquiry process, which has now been completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Copyright protection is a crucial mechanism that provides for the viability of Australia's creators and creative industries. In recent times, the increased use of the internet and access to copyright material through digital means has had a twofold effect. On the one hand, it has created more opportunities for copyright owners to get their creative content out into the public domain and it has allowed consumers to enjoy this content in new and very innovative ways. But, on the other hand, copyright infringement now poses a threat to copyright owners due to the emergence of a myriad of websites which contain infringing material and facilitate infringement of copyright. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of an example, in their submission to the inquiry, Village Roadshow documented the number of downloads of two Australian films which have been subsidised by the government's tax offset arrangements. In the statistics provided in their submission, the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Mad Max</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Fury Road</span> had 600,000 legal downloads and a staggering one million illegal downloads. The film <span style="font-style:italic;">Lion</span> was downloaded some 710,000 times, with over half of that number being illegal downloads. These are staggering numbers. Both highlight the concerns and issues this bill sets out to address and exemplify the reason we need to protect copyright owners from threat of copyright infringement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes a number of amendments which would facilitate the protection of copyright material, such as with these two Australian films. The expansion of section 115A would allow an injunction to extend to both carriage service providers and online search engine providers to block or not provide access to locations which provide access to copyrighted material. By expanding the legislation to provide for more protection to copyright material, Australian films such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mad Max</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Fury Road</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lion</span> will be further protected from illegal downloads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many submissions to the inquiry expressed concerns that the proposed changes to the legislation and the widening of section 115A to include a 'primary effect' test could result in the site blocking of online locations which are operating very much for legitimate purposes. There were also a number of submissions drawing attention to the ability of carriage service providers and search engine providers to extend the sites blocked under the bill without any further judicial oversight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having reviewed the submissions both in support of and in opposition to the passage of the bill, we found the arguments were evenly balanced. This is not to say that those arguments do not have some merit, as this legislation is certainly not perfect, but I believe there are adequate safeguards in this bill that would prevent section 115A being applied to locations which are operated for legitimate purposes. Centre Alliance was initially going to put forward an amendment to have the operation of these amendments reviewed after 24 months, particularly given the number of concerns which were expressed during the inquiry. We felt that this would be the best way to review the effectiveness of the measures outlined in this bill to see whether any adverse consequences had emerged as a result of the broadening of the legislation. However, we have been informed that the government is committed to a review of this legislation, and we're happy to support this and support passage of the bill in its current form on the basis that the government commits to a review in 24 months time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  Thank you, colleagues, for your contributions to this debate on the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018. The purpose of this bill is to further modernise Australia's copyright laws. The bill will ensure that website blocking remains an effective means for copyright owners to address large-scale copyright infringement by overseas operators. Together with small business tax relief and location incentives, these changes will help our creative industries to produce Australian content and tell Australian stories. They will also support investments that have made it possible for Australians to enjoy their favourite films, TV shows and music where and when they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank all the stakeholders who were consulted on the exposure draft of this bill and also those who participated in the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill. The government did carefully consider the comments and matters from stakeholders and made numerous adjustments to the bill prior to its introduction into the other place. Some expressed concern about the cost and difficulty of establishing that an infringing website is located overseas. In a global internet environment, proving that an online location is physically outside Australia is a very high threshold, given the use of proxy servers and other devices to mask locations. To address this concern, the bill includes an evidential presumption that an online location is outside Australia unless proven otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concern was also expressed that copyright owners could dictate the blocking of an open-ended list of URLs, domain names or IP addresses without agreement of carriage service providers or online search engine providers. That is not the government's intention with this bill, and a provision was included—subsection 115A(2B)—that confirms that the Federal Court may grant an injunction that allows the blocking of future domain names, URLs and IP addresses on the condition that there is written agreement between the parties. This is consistent with orders that have been made by the court to date that explicitly provide for certain steps to be agreed in writing between the parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted in the Senate committee inquiry report, the measures are appropriately circumscribed, with the court maintaining ultimate oversight over these types of injunctions, including the requirement that there be evidence of a sufficient nexus between the online location covered by the original injunction and the location to which the order is expanded. Some stakeholders suggested that 'online search engine provider' should be defined. Doing so would be problematic and would risk locking into legislation a definition that is rendered redundant by the fast-moving changes underway in the technology sector. Instead, the bill has been amended to provide the minister with a power to exclude certain online search engine providers from the website-blocking provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee queried the justification for this power, noting that significant matters such as the specification of providers that are to be exempted from an injunctive scheme should be included in primary legislation. As noted in the government response to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, there is adequate justification for this power. This measure provides a more flexible way of dealing with the potential, although small, that an injunction is brought against a party to which these provisions were not intended to apply. Although this power is unlikely to be used, it provides an important safeguard to discourage overreach by copyright owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of the scheme to include online search engine providers is an important measure that will improve the effectiveness of the scheme. As noted in the Senate committee inquiry report, a measure of this type is appropriate given that these providers play a significant role in both the infringement and the enforcement of copyright. They are part of the problem as well as the solution. Some also expressed concern about the primary purpose or primary effect test—that it would enable sites such as Pinterest and Google Translate to be captured by a copyright-blocking injunction. This is highly unlikely to occur, particularly as the court may consider, under subsection 115A(5), a number of factors when determining whether to grant an injunction, including proportionality and public interest. It's difficult to imagine that legitimate websites with other purposes or effects, such as social media websites and translation websites, would satisfy this test. Nonetheless, the bill was adjusted to include a cross-reference to subsection 115A(5) to make clear that this is relevant to the Federal Court's considerations in determining whether to grant injunctions. The Senate committee inquiry report also concluded that there are adequate safeguards in section 115A, including as amended, to ensure that unintended consequences, such as it extending to legitimate sites, would not occur in practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also a range of concerns raised that did not warrant amendments to the bill. Some stakeholders argued that wording changes in subsection 115A(1) from 'reasonable steps' to 'such steps as the court considers reasonable to disable access' would lead to the court ordering inappropriate steps. But this change, which is intended to clarify that the court has the discretion to set the terms of the reasonable steps, is merely reflective of how the court has applied the test to date. In effect, the revised provision will continue to operate as it currently does in practice. Some were concerned that the primary effect test would increase the risk of carriage service providers being liable for costs in proceedings. Some also asked for subsection 115A(9) to be amended to provided that carriage service providers are not liable for costs even if they take part in proceedings. This is not an amendment the government supports. The Federal Court is best placed to decide on issues such as the awarding of costs, and it would not be appropriate to override or fetter this discretion. Some argued that copyright infringements are being effectively dealt with through voluntary actions to block and reduce access to infringing sites and that injunctions are therefore unnecessary. The government welcomes efforts by some players, including Google, to voluntarily curb access to copyright-infringing sites. This is a positive development and is entirely consistent with the government's overall approach to copyright. However, voluntary measures are just that; they're voluntary. The website-blocking scheme simply provides a fallback if voluntary measures prove to be insufficient or are not implemented broadly across the industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted earlier, the Senate committee inquiry considered submissions from a broad range of copyright owners, carriage service providers, digital platforms and digital rights groups. The committee concluded that, on balance, the benefits of the bill outweigh any potential negative impacts that could arise. The committee also recommended that the government review the effectiveness of the measures contained in the bill two years after its enactment. This is a sensible proposition and one that the government supports. A review of the operation of the copyright website-blocking scheme will be conducted within two years of the commencement of the bill, and the findings and recommendations of that review will be made public. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an important reform to Australia's copyright framework that will ensure that the Australian creative sector can continue to invest in quality content and stories. I thank colleagues across the chamber for their support for this legislation. I particularly acknowledge the positive and constructive approach that Mr Mark Dreyfus, the shadow Attorney-General, has taken in relation to this matter, and I do want to acknowledge that in copyright matters in general Mr Dreyfus has been a good colleague to work with. I also acknowledge Senator Griff and his positive contribution on behalf of Centre Alliance and also Senator Hanson-Young, who has also been very supportive of sensible changes to copyright legislation, particularly this piece of legislation before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I commend the bill to colleagues, I do note that Senator Hanson-Young was on the speaker's list but was not in a position, I believe, to make her contribution at the time I got the call for the summing up. So, Mr Acting Deputy President, assuming she wishes to make a contribution, it's in the hands of the chamber as to whether that is possible after the minister has spoken or whether that is best made in the committee stage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  Yes. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Leyonhjelm, and thank you to the minister for giving me some space to put on the record my contribution. I'll keep it brief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what the purpose of this bill, the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018, is: it is to ensure Australian artists are given due credit and payment for their work and to protect them from having their work stolen, pirated or abused. It will do this by targeting those who intend to steal their work online. We know that, while many Australian artists have had to adapt to the new world order of the digital revolution, they've done so having to back themselves, often taking the risk financially without knowing exactly how it was going to pay off. Over recent years, we've seen Australian artists starting to do more and more engagement with the digital world and grapple with the issues of copyright but also do more in how they reach audiences and build a reputation and support from those online audiences as well. This bill, notwithstanding the comments put on the record by my colleague Senator Steele-John, will go some way to ensuring that artists, particularly small and independent artists, can have at least an avenue to protect their work if, indeed, it is stolen or there is an infringement of copyright use that undermines their ability to get paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see Australian artists supported more and more. This bill creates a pathway for artists and creators to have their rights protected, but we need to do more than this to ensure that Australian artists are given strong policy backing in this country. That's one of the reasons the Greens strongly believe, in a creative Australia, we need a creativity commission—an agency in Australia that would underpin and support Australian artists and the ability of creativity to permeate across all sections of the economy and society. We believe, fundamentally, in the ability of the arts, of creativity, to improve all of our lives. We believe that our culture is made richer through the contribution of creative endeavours. We believe that artists have the right to have their work protected. That includes, of course, artists who work offline and also artists who work fundamentally and predominantly in an online and digital space. They too need to be respected and recognised for the amazing contribution that they give to innovation in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We pride ourselves on developing and advocating for strong policies to support creative Australia. That's why we've been leading an inquiry into Australian content creation, ensuring that Australian stories are promoted and supported through the various different platforms, whether that's traditional broadcast or platforms online or, indeed, even radio. I note that today is the Australian music awards, the ARIA awards, where, for the first time in a long time, the majority of nominees up for awards are Australian artists who are coming back to Australia and investing back into the Australian creative environment. Having their work recognised through those awards will be a great thing to see happen this evening. I just want to say: well done to all the nominees today, and congratulations to those who ultimately win those awards as they're announced later on tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A creativity commission would give Australian artists and creators the ability to have their contribution to the economy and to society recognised. We have a Productivity Commission, we have the CSIRO, we have the Human Rights Commission—all different areas which we understand deserve special recognition in a variety of ways. We have the Productivity Commission, we have the CSIRO, we have the Human Rights Commission—all different areas which we understand deserve special recognition in a variety of ways. It is time that Australian artists and creators also have the backing of a government funded agency that upholds and promotes the benefits of creativity to our entire community, economy and society. That is something I'll be pushing for very strongly over the coming months and I look forward to discussions on both sides of the chamber as to how we can ensure that Australian artists and creators, in the online and offline environment, can be supported better and wholeheartedly by all sides of politics and all sides of the chamber.</span>

Today there are more than 40 million people around the world in slavery. That is more than at any time in human history. Two-thirds of those people are in the Asia-Pacific region, right on our doorstep. In fact, there are now more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any time in human history. They're all around us: in our regions, our products, our services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deprivation of someone's liberty is one of the greatest violations of human rights. We can and must do more to prevent this practice. Labor believes that an effective, strong modern slavery act is an important first step in tackling this problem. That's why, over a year ago, Labor announced our commitment to introduce a modern slavery act and establish an independent antislavery commissioner if elected. We are so pleased that the government has followed our lead and introduced this bill. The bill would, for the first time, establish a supply chain transparency reporting obligation requiring major Australian businesses to report on what steps they're taking to identify modern slavery in their supply chains. Done well, this bill could reframe how businesses approach the issue of slavery in their supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as with all great reforms, the devil is in the detail. To make real change, the law must have teeth. Labor is very disappointed that the government refused to include penalties for companies that breached the proposed Modern Slavery Act and opted for a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner. This weak commitment is disappointing but hardly surprising from a government that has shown itself, time after time, to be toothless when it comes to regulating big business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor moved amendments in the House of Representatives to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the Modern Slavery Act and called for the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. While we support this bill because it's a step in the right direction, we believe that the government can and must do better to tackle the appalling human rights abuse. First and foremost, the Modern Slavery Act must have penalties for non-compliance. Labor believes we should not be leaving it to big business to police themselves on slavery. There is a genuine passion in the business community and in the broader Australian community to fight slavery. No business wants slavery in their supply chain. No consumer wants products tainted by slavery. But if there are no penalties there's a high risk that many companies simply won't comply.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Three years since the UK Act's enactment, only approximately half of the 9,000-11,000 organisations that the UK Government estimates are required to report, have produced a 'slavery and human trafficking statement'.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many stakeholders argue passionately for there to be penalties for companies who breach the Modern Slavery Act. This included the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam, all of whom called for penalties to be included in the bill. The ACTU, in their submission, argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Combating slavery should not be optional. There's no excuse for not looking. Labor will again be moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with the Modern Slavery Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also address the need for a commissioner. About once a month we hear, watch or read about a new case of slavery right here in Australia, whether it be migrant workers in agriculture or women in sex work. Earlier this year, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> reported that, just a few kilometres from where we stand right now in Parliament House, at least 20 domestic workers were trapped as slaves, yet no-one ever seems to be held to account, and the facts bear this out. The most recent figures from Senate estimates revealed that in five years, despite all the articles we've read about slavery in Australia, just seven people were successfully convicted. We must do more to crack down on this sickening crime. That's why, over a year ago, Labor committed to establishing an office of the independent slavery commissioner if we were elected. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Key stakeholders including the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner. The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern, as always, is to protect big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Labor is also very concerned that the bill includes forced marriage as one of the forms of exploitation required to be reported on by business. Key stakeholders have warned that this bill may have unintended consequences, including driving forced marriage further underground. As Good Shepherd state in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ordinarily it is not the role of business to inquire into the private lives of its employees, contractors or suppliers (or employees of its contractors) in order to identify practices such as forced marriage. If we liken the practice of forced marriage to that of family violence, corporate responsibility lies with supporting the wellbeing of individuals impacted by violence, not in identification and reporting on violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of driving this practice further underground by making it the problem of business, the government should improve the support services it provides to victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these concerns, I want to acknowledge the bipartisan and cooperative approach of the assistant minister Senator Reynolds, who's in the chamber today, and reiterate Labor's support for this bill more broadly. Labor passionately supports the introduction of a modern slavery act. We want to see action on this important issue of human rights, and we will be moving amendments to make this bill stronger so that we can move forward in the fight against slavery.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak on this very important piece of legislation, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, and indicate the Greens' support for this bill. Modern slavery as defined by this bill includes slavery, servitude, forced labour, deceptive recruiting, trafficking in persons, debt bondage and organ trafficking. People can, of course—and far too many people, both globally and in Australia, do—find themselves enslaved through threats of violence and bullying or, in some cases, actually through being bought and sold or having their movements restricted. As such, modern slavery can include being forced to work for low wages in sectors like construction, in sweatshops or in food supply chains, including in the agriculture sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the 2018 Global Slavery Index, there are in excess of 40 million people globally who are subject to some form of modern slavery, and collectively about US$150 billion, which is well over A$200 billion per year, is generated in the global private economy from forced labour alone. There are around 30 million people in the Asia-Pacific region who are enslaved, which is over 65 per cent of all people in that region, and, again, according to that index, there are over 4,000 people who are enslaved in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our country, modern slavery is found in the horticulture sector—for example, when backpackers are underpaid, denied visa extensions by their employers or forced to live in substandard accommodation—but it also exists in a range of other sectors, including, arguably, the underpayments of Australian workers employed by companies like 7-Eleven, Domino's and Pizza Hut. Cleaners working in retail chains for contracting or subcontracting cleaning companies are also indicative of oppressive working conditions that may amount to modern slavery. There are, of course, workers in the textile or clothing sector. When we talk about sweatshops, we usually think about things going on overseas, but in this country there are people who are often older migrants to this country, who may not have strong English language skills, who are stitching together clothes or labels onto clothes for as little as $3 or $4 an hour. So this is a serious issue globally but it is also a serious issue in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses, in our increasingly globalised markets, often have supply chains that span multiple countries, and for many Australian companies those supply chains are heavily networked into the Asia-Pacific region. And, because of this multinational complexity, many Australian businesses may actually be unaware of the risks of modern slavery being used in their supply chains. Earlier this year, the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply released the results of a slavery survey it conducted which found that 20 per cent of organisations had not taken any measures to ensure a slavery-free supply chain but 80 per cent said that they were motivated to address the issue due to the reputational risk of ignoring it. That survey also found that only 11 per cent of organisations have total transparency across their entire supply chains, whether that be food or any other sector. So, the time for an Australian modern slavery act is well upon us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill follows an inquiry into establishing an Australian modern slavery act undertaken last year by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Its report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span>, made 48 recommendations. Principal to those recommendations was the establishment of an Australian modern slavery act and, it must be noted, an independent antislavery commissioner to lead and coordinate Australia's response to combating modern slavery. I'll speak a little more about the lack of an independent antislavery commissioner shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, though, this bill comes on the back of decades of campaigning by antislavery advocates and non-government organisations in Australia. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of them—and some of them are in the gallery today—for their important and selfless contributions to getting us to where we are today, debating an important bill with broad public and political support in this country and in this parliament. The Greens have supported these campaigns and taken these arguments to parliament, and we're very pleased to be part of what I believe has been a genuinely collaborative approach in this place to deliver this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, once enacted, will require Australian businesses with annual consolidated revenues of more than $100 million to publish annual statements on the steps they are taking to address modern slavery in their supply chains and operations. At this threshold the act will capture about 3,000 companies. These companies will then be required to produce annual slavery statements, signed off at board level, to be published within six months of their annual reports. To educate affected companies on compliance, the government will establish a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs. Home Affairs will also produce and publish an annual statement in the Commonwealth parliament on possible modern slavery risks. Importantly, the act will be reviewed in three years, but the Greens have a very strong view that this should be a rolling review rather than a one-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out that this bill regrettably does not include an independent office of oversight. An independent office of oversight was something that was overwhelmingly called for and supported by stakeholders in the sector and, as such, was a recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill; it was recommendation 3. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, STOP THE TRAFFIK argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the issue of modern slavery is not addressed by one Government department alone … There are at least six government departments whose engagement and action will be required to implement the Act effectively … An Independent Commissioner would be able to work with these departments in a more effective manner than an interdepartmental mechanism led by one department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens completely agree with the sentiments in that submission. The Human Rights Law Centre mounted a similar argument, noting in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UK Anti-Slavery Commissioner Mr Hyland has, according to many UK organisations, been central to raising the profile of these issues within the UK and improving inter-agency cooperation, leading for example to increased numbers of prosecutions and convictions for modern slavery in the UK … Mr Hyland argued that the independence of the Office has been central to its success, enabling him to be a "critical friend" to government agencies, businesses and other stakeholders alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out here that, if you look at Australian political history, particularly recent history, it is people who have statutory independence and the resources and expertise to support them who are best able to drive change. For the Greens, the lack of a genuinely independent office of oversight is the biggest flaw in this legislation, and it is extremely regrettable that the government, having supported the findings of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill and having supported the recommendation for an independent antislavery commissioner, has now crab-walked away from that position. It's very disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interests of seeing this important bill pass in some form in this term of the parliament, we're not going to seek to move detailed amendments in the committee stage of this bill, because we do not want to risk the government—which is becoming increasingly chaotic and losing the capacity to manage its own affairs in the House of Representatives—denying this legislation the chance to proceed through the parliament. So we will reluctantly take a collaborative approach to this legislation in the interests of laying a foundation for a legislative program around modern slavery in this country. But we do want to make it very clear that we have a strong view that there needs to be an independent office of oversight. We would urge the government to come back and move amendments to the bill later in this term, and we would urge the Labor Party, in the overwhelmingly likely event that they win government within the next six months or so, to prioritise bringing amendments to this legislation back into parliament to fix up some of the omissions in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also doesn't provide for penalties. Some stakeholders, in their submissions to the inquiry and in public commentary, have argued for penalties. Others, however, have argued that the first three years should be without penalties and, instead, the focus over those three years should be on developing capacity and buy-in from business. In other words, that argument says we should be focusing more on the carrot than the stick. Many stakeholders that have met with the Greens have expressed a concern that, if organisations are faced with penalties from the day of enactment, not only are they being set up to fail but their efforts will go into avoiding penalties by hiding noncompliance. Although organisations may consider these avoidances as temporary measures until they gain an understanding of what compliance is and what it requires, they will most likely, once initiated, become systemic to their culture and operations, which would, of course, undermine the intent of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens hear that argument. We do believe there is a role for penalties to play in this legislation. Whether those penalties are implemented now or later on, once organisations have had time to understand what's required of them, is, in fact, a judgement call. But we argued in our additional comments to the Senate inquiry into this bill that, at the very least, penalties should be considered in the act's first three-year review. And we welcome the government's amendment which, I understand, will require that that occurs. We also believe there's an important leadership role for governments to play in ensuring their own supply chains are as compliant as those in the private sector that will be legislated by this act. For this, there should be a requirement that entities over the reportable threshold comply with the Modern Slavery Act in order to be eligible for government tenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Several submitters to the Senate inquiry also called for the act to include a national compensation scheme for victims of modern slavery. There are no greater defenders of human rights in this place than the Australian Greens. I could go through a list of areas where we have consistently stood up for human rights and consistently lost the argument based on the numbers in this place, with the Labor Party and the Liberal Party voting together against fundamental human rights. But we do support the fourth pillar—as we do the other three—of the Australian government's National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery. That fourth pillar, of course, is victim support and protection. But we're not convinced that this act is the most appropriate instrument with which to legislate such a scheme and, as such, it was our recommendation to the Senate inquiry that consideration of a national compensation scheme should be the next priority consideration for the parliament regarding modern slavery. We also recommended that part of this consideration by the Senate or parliament would include whether a victim support scheme would sit under this act or under other Commonwealth legislation such as the Social Security Act, which includes compensation schemes that provide for payments to Australian victims of terrorism overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another shortcoming that we and many other stakeholders recognised in this bill is its single review of the act in three years. It's worth placing on the record that once this legislation passes—and I genuinely hope it does pass this year; it's ultimately a matter for the government, or the House of Representatives—it'll be a massive learning curve both for businesses and for government. There'll be many elements of this legislation, such as the need for and form of the penalties that I spoke about earlier, that will need to be reviewed after three years. The first three-year review will likely lead to significant changes being made and administered after its conclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will also need reviewing once they've been implemented and bedded down. For this reason, the Greens have a strong view that regular rolling reviews of complex acts like these ought to be standard practice, particularly in areas that exist in changing and evolving environments such as this. But, once again, the government doesn't appear willing to support that, and that's regrettable. Rather than placing the passage of this bill through the parliament at risk, I'll instead move a second reading amendment for a rolling three-year review of the act which would be conducted by an independent statutory antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make the point that, on a bill this important and life-changing to so many vulnerable and exploited people around the world, it would be extremely regrettable if this bill were not to pass through the parliament. What we have before us is a bill that will bring Australia into line with jurisdictions such as the UK, the European Union and some states in the United States—and some sectors in the US—when it comes to taking strong action against modern slavery in our backyards and beyond. This is a bill that has broad cross-party support in this parliament, and it's something that everyone who supports it should be proud of. I've always regretted, through my political career, that more attention in the media and on social media is not paid to issues where people come together and work collaboratively and are prepared to put aside political differences to progress an important issue. Again, this is a classic example of a really important piece of legislation that's flown very much under the radar in media and public commentary terms, which is regrettable because, as I said, it's come about as a result of a genuinely collaborative approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, I want to thank everyone who's worked so hard to get this legislation up, including stakeholders who are in the gallery today watching this debate. I also want to particularly acknowledge the effort and the constructive work put into this by Senator Reynolds, who I genuinely believe deserves great credit for the collaborative way that she's approached this issue. Although there are, arguably—and in the view of the Greens—ways this legislation could have been made better, we're not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good in this case. This is a good first step for Australia to take in accepting responsibility and joining global efforts to stamp out modern slavery worldwide. That's why we will support this important bill and all that it seeks to do, but we will continue to work to see the improvements that we believe are necessary made to this legislation in the future. I move the second reading amendment in my name:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add "but the Senate is of the opinion that, every three years, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Slavery Act 2018</span> should be subject to a review conducted by an independent statutory Anti-Slavery Commissioner".</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which I chair, investigated the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, held hearings into the bill and came to conclusions which are set out in the report of the committee, which was tabled a couple of months ago. I want to start by thanking all of those who made submissions to the inquiry and those who came and gave evidence to the committee. The work of the submitters was very much appreciated, and I congratulate them on the work they've done and the work that I know that they've been doing over a long period of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that I'm very proud to be part of a government that actually introduced this bill. This is something that has been talked about for a long time, but it's taken a Liberal-National government to actually introduce the bill and to move ahead with the fight against modern slavery. I particularly want to acknowledge Senator Reynolds, one of our colleagues in this chamber, who has done an enormous amount of work on this particular bill. I also congratulate Mr Chris Crewther, who was chairman of the joint committee that investigated this issue—modern slavery in Australia—over a long period of time, putting in a very detailed report with a number of recommendations, some of which were taken up by our committee in reviewing the government's legislation. The report of the joint committee was not in relation to any particular piece of legislation but a general review of the whole subject, and I believe it was as a result of the work of that joint committee that the government has introduced this bill and taken the first step in Australia towards combating modern slavery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very often our opponents in this chamber, as is their ability, of course, try to pretend that they, rather than the government, are the sole guardians of social justice in Australia. But if you look back through history you'll find that it's the Liberal and National parties that have done most of the work in social justice, and this particular bill is a great example of that. I acknowledge that the committee I spoke about previously has done a lot of work, but I again acknowledge there are many groups in society who have been working on this for a long time, who the government has consulted with and who gave evidence to our committee. I again thank them for alerting other Australians to the issue and to proposing solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After its deliberations, the committee made five recommendations, and I'll briefly run through them. I thank the government for adopting, I think, three out of the five recommendations and, on the two others, noting reasons for not accepting them at the present time. Before I do that, I will refer to some of the issues. A number of submitters proposed amendments or suggested ways in which the bill could be improved. But I think those submitters who were particularly involved came to the conclusion that, whilst the bill wasn't absolutely 100 per cent perfect, it was important to get the bill dealt with, and dealt with quickly, and to adopt the bill on the basis that it would be reviewed in three years and that this quite significant change to the way businesses operate in Australia could be assessed over that three-year period and any recommendations for the future could be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to refer to what I thought was the very good evidence given by a person who I might say would be surprised, along with me, that I would ever say that he was right on the mark, and that's Mr Chris Evans, who was, as you might recall, the Leader of the Government in the Senate during one of the Labor periods of government. Chris Evans gave evidence on the behalf of the Walk Free Foundation, and he gave evidence at the same time as Ms Heather Moore, who is from the Freedom Partnership to end modern slavery. Some of their evidence to the committee was very mature and very sound and influenced the committee in the resolutions it reached. Ms Moore, on behalf of the Freedom Partnership, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in our submission, we think that there could be some minor improvements to this bill, but I'd like to say first and foremost that we think it's a very good bill, we support this bill and we would like to see it passed as soon as practicable—before the end of the year if possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very grateful for the support of the Labor Party, who I acknowledge joined with government members on the committee to recommend passing the bill with the recommendations the committee made. That means that this bill will pass by the end of the year, as Ms Moore asked. I'm delighted, I might say, to hear Senator McKim also adopt that approach, the approach of Mr Evans—that is, whilst some people may have some reservations, it's important to get it dealt with and dealt with as soon as possible. In his opening remarks, Mr Evans said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You might be surprised, Chair—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as we had a bit of a talk about this before he gave his evidence—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">that I'm here to support the government's legislation in large part, and that's because I think they got it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then gave some evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was some comment, as Senator McKim and others have spoken about, about the statutory officer. There was debate about what this officer should do. As I understand it, the committee came to the conclusion that this officer should just be a friend of those—like a friend of the court—who were getting involved in defeating modern slavery. It is quite a remarkable change for business. We've looked at it, certainly, from the point of view of the victims of modern slavery, as we should. But, for this to work, businesses will have to make quite a dramatic change in the way they operate, particularly businesses with very long supply chains. I don't have the figure in my mind, but Qantas, I think, were given as an example where they had—again, don't hold me to these figures—over 10,000 different suppliers in their supply chain. For Qantas, or any business, then to be able to ensure not only that they were doing the right thing, which they can easily do, but that every one of those 10,000-odd suppliers was doing the right thing as well is, of course, a mammoth task and a mammoth change in the way businesses operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of having a statutory officer was, as I recall, to give help to businesses in that first three-year period. That's why the government and the committee opposed the suggestions that penalties should be introduced straight away. It is going to be a dramatic change. It will involve my old profession of the law. It will involve a lot of work for lawyers, and I suspect lawyers are looking forward to this, because it will be a lot of work. Businesses will have to look at this very carefully and make sure they're doing it correctly, and that will involve paying highly paid lawyers, which is good for the profession but also good to make sure that businesses do do the right thing, as is required by this law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In dealing with this bill the committee heard a lot about the UK provisions and the Hong Kong provisions, as I recall. We had the advantage of learning from the beneficial parts of operations in other countries and also where those operations have gone wrong. Mr Evans was one who did not agree with the view that it would be something 'which we associate with mediation, arbitration and decision-making'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I haven't found a really good name, but I think of it as an advocacy or advisory role—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that a statutory officer could have. That was one of the recommendations made by the committee, which the government, I don't think, has taken up, but I'll come back to that later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Mr Evans and Ms Moore, and indeed, many of the submitters, agreed that it was important to get this bill in place, to get the bill working and to have that review in three years when we can determine what sort of amendments need to be made, whether penalties were necessary and whether businesses were doing the right thing. The committee, you might note, Deputy President, did recommend that the government establish a list of those reporting entities, work towards building a list of reporting entities and publish compliance standards publically in order to test the proposition that reputational risk, which had been spoken about by many of the submitters, is a sufficient motivator for reporting entities to comply with the requirements of the act. That was the first recommendation of the committee, which the government has accepted in principle. That will occur at an administrative level, as I understand it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second recommendation was that the committee suggests that the list of entities who do report, including entities outside the compliance threshold who report voluntarily, should be published publicly. This was suggesting that, even when you didn't have to report, many companies would, for business reasons, report and say, 'Although we're not required to do this, we're going to tell you what we've done so you will know that we are a good corporate citizen, that we're doing the right thing.' And of course there was the suggestion that, as I said, there was reputational advantage to companies that were able to report. The committee made a recommendation about that independent statutory officer, with powers to be a help. Although the government hasn't accepted that at this stage, they've noted the suggestion and the recommendation by the committee, and I understand that that's something that will be at the forefront when the review takes place in three years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee further recommended that the three-year statutory review period include consideration of all aspects of the act, with particular attention to compliance thresholds and compliance standards, and that the review be required to consider whether a mandatory penalty is required, drawing on the evidence and data gathered in the first three years of the act. The committee acknowledges that it may be shown that penalties are not needed. The government has accepted that recommendation, I'm pleased to say. The committee heard contrasting views on whether the bill should or shouldn't include provision for penalties. Some argued that industry-driven compliance rates would be low without penalties. Others suggested that compliance standards would be more rigorous and meaningful without the penalty regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted that the lack of a penalty regime makes the bill consistent with similar legislation in the UK and some parts of Europe and the US and that it is designed to encourage a race to the top rather than to set up a coercive punishment regime that may be counterproductive to compliance and quality of reporting statements. The committee said in its report that it's not averse to the inclusion of a penalty scheme but it is of the view that any consideration of the potential efficacy and scope of the penalty scheme would be most usefully conducted as part of the statutory three-year review of the act, with the benefit of the substantial data that will have been amassed by that time regarding the act generally and compliance specifically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee recommended that the various legislative pieces relating to modern slavery and our various acts, including the Criminal Code and certain migration bills, be collated into one place to make it easier for those seeking to comply. The government's noted that and will look at whether it is possible and will be useful. Of course, there was another recommendation of the committee, and that was that the bill be passed, taking into account the other recommendations made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted that this bill will come into effect with, I think, the support of all parties—even, dare I say, the Greens political party, who, responsibly, have said that they are not going to move amendments in the committee stage. Whilst there are some aspects of the bill that they don't like, they recognise that the greater importance is to get the bill through. I conclude by saying how proud I am—and how proud I know all the members of the government are—that it is this government, the Liberal-Nationals government, that has actually worked and legislated for an issue that has been around for a long, long time. Again, I thank all the other groups. I've mentioned two of them, but there was a series of them, mentioned in our report, who made some submissions and gave evidence, and I want to thank all of them. I again acknowledge the work of Senator Reynolds and Mr Crewther in the joint standing committee that looked into this in some great detail, as it was their work that has initiated this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by thanking other members of the committee, most of whom I think have spoken or will speak in this debate. That includes the deputy chair, Senator Pratt, and Senator Molan, Senator McKim, Senator Hume and Senator Watt. I thank them for the contribution they made to this report. As always, I thank the hardworking and very astute staff that the Senate is fortunate to have in the committee secretariat, who support Senate committees in delivering their reports. This shows the Senate committee system at its very best. Sometimes I'm very critical of the system when it is used for purely crass political purposes, but this bill report is a great example of how the Senate committees work properly. People work together, they take submissions, they consider submissions, and they say to the government at times, 'Thanks for this, but you haven't got it quite right and the whole system would prove better if it were amended slightly.' I'm delighted that our government has been mature enough and good enough to say, 'We accept that our bill needs some tweaking and we're going to do it.' Congratulations to all involved—the committee, the submitters and the government—for doing it. It is a good bill, long overdue, but hopefully it will be here in 2018.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I rise to contribute on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 after a hard-fought campaign by a wide range of stakeholders that Labor has listened to and responded to. The clothes we buy and the food we eat in Australia is often imported or includes imported parts. Many countries from which it is sourced do not benefit from the labour regulations we enjoy here at home. Indeed, new research published in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Communications</span> found that fishing crews all over the world are working excessive hours for little or no pay in horrific conditions. Modern slavery is real, it is pervasive and it is everywhere. There are more people in slavery or slavery-like conditions in 2018 than at any other time in human history. Many of these are children. The International Labor Organisation has estimated that about 168 million children worldwide are engaged in child labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two-thirds of the 45.8 million people trapped in slavery worldwide are in the Asia-Pacific region. Many of them are stuck in the global supply chains of products and services that Australians use every day. They are victims of exploitation in private sector activities like manufacturing, construction, agricultural and fishing. Even in Australia, an estimated 4,300 people are currently trapped in slavery or slavery-like conditions. They are migrant workers, international students, backpackers and women; they are people working in horticultural industries, our convenience stores or for labour-hire companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we rightly find the notion of slavery abhorrent. It conjures images of subjugation, pain and fear. As a society we know this is unacceptable. Modern slavery is the worst abuse of humanity by humanity. We are all shamed by this shocking reality. Modern slavery harms people of all ages, genders and races. It deprives people of their autonomy, their freedom, their potential and their dignity. It harms their physical and mental wellbeing. Eighty per cent of the 75 million people who make our clothes are women between the ages of 18 and 35. Often these women live in poverty, suffer from exploitation and verbal and physical abuse and work for as little as the equivalent of A40c an hour. That is why a number of countries, including the UK, France and the Netherlands, have acted with legislation to curb the rise of slavery in business supply chains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this modern slavery legislation introduced by the government is welcome, it is indeed very much overdue and it does lack the teeth contained in models adopted elsewhere. The lack of an independent antislavery commissioner or adequate penalties makes it a lost opportunity to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts broadly and child labour in particular. Its major legislative omissions will substantially curtail the success of the implementation of this act. No person wants to purchase goods tainted by slavery. No business wants slavery in its supply chains. With this legislation, turning a blind eye to allegations of slavery will no longer be an option, and that is a very good thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislative change in Australia has been the culmination of advocacy across a multitude of sectors by people dedicated to ensuring human rights in Australia are respected, and it should be no surprise that it has been Labor that has been very supportive and has been listening to that sector and leading every step of the way. In 2016, I initiated an inquiry into human trafficking as part of my role as deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. It ended with key recommendations to prevent such instances and provide support to victims. This was then followed in 2017, as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, with an inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. The committee held public hearings in Mildura, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, and its recommendations were consistent with those of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's inquiry into human trafficking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that there are serious gaps in the way victims are identified and supported as well as in the ways our criminal justice agencies cooperate to bring perpetrators to justice. Particularly concerning were the reports by stakeholders of serious misconduct in overseas residential institutions and within Australia, particularly in the horticulture and labour hire companies. For example, in Mildura, the committee heard from Mr Turaga of Fiji. He had been promised the opportunity to work in Australia and to earn a fair living, with the opportunity to study and the ability to send money back home to his family. Instead, he had his passport taken upon arrival, he was told he had to pay back a debt associated with the cost of him coming to Australia, he was forced to work over 12 hours a day and his wages were not repatriated to his family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further investigations revealed that this kind of exploitation was not isolated. The committee heard that such passport seizures, wage theft and violations of even the most basic workplace health and safety laws had become a business model for labour hire companies. As a result, the foreign affairs committee's report recommended a series of changes to the way Australia's victim support programs operate, including the introduction of a national compensation scheme; improvements to how victims are supported in the visa process; the delinking of this support from criminal prosecutions; and the introduction of a national labour hire licensing scheme. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee listened to stakeholders and recommended the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner, the introduction of global supply chain reporting requirements and penalties for their breach. The committee also made a series of recommendations to improve coordination and training for Australia's law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supported these recommendations. In fact, the recommendations were in lock step with Labor's policy to introduce a modern slavery act in Australia, announced by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow justice minister, Clare O'Neil, in June last year. Labor's proposed Australian modern slavery act includes supply chain reporting requirements for major Australian companies and the establishment of an antislavery commissioner. A Labor government would enforce supply chain reporting requirements for all major businesses, ensuring that no Australian company is either directly or indirectly engaged in modern slavery. Major Australian companies will be required to comply by reporting annually to the government with a slavery and human trafficking statement detailing the steps they've taken to ensure that modern slavery is not occurring in their business or their supply chain. Each statement must include specific information about the company's supply chain: where risks have been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being taken to ensure slavery is not part of that supply chain, training provided to staff on these matters, and whether slavery has been found in the supply chain and what action has been taken. The list of companies in Australia who are required to report under Labor's Australian modern slavery act will be publicly available. A central repository of statements will be established, and, most importantly, there will be penalties for noncompliance with the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will also establish an office of an Australian independent antislavery commissioner, recognising the importance of this role in ensuring the effectiveness of the legislation. A Labor government, unlike this government, will introduce an independent antislavery commissioner to monitor and scrutinise the government's work in tackling modern slavery and to help address the gaps in enforcement and victim support. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of such a role. Labor's commissioner will work with victims of slavery to receive inquiries and complaints. Labor's commissioner will assist business in building and improving best practice in protecting their supply chains from the taint of slavery. Labor's commissioner will work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Labor's commissioner will lead Australia's global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations. The legislation before us does not achieve any of this. The government's decision to reject an independent antislavery commissioner in favour of a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern, unfortunately, as always, is with protecting big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absence of civil penalties in this bill is baffling. Leaving companies to police themselves has not been effective in any other jurisdiction. The banks didn't do it, and neither did the insurance companies, and companies aren't doing it in the United Kingdom. Evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that, in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that are reporting still hovers at around 30 per cent of those that supposedly have had an obligation to do so. That is not good enough. Conforming to the law cannot be an option. It is important to achieve the right balance to ensure companies are encouraged to undertake best practice and scrutinise their suppliers to ensure that they are also compliant. Regardless of size, all businesses have a responsibility to ensure that they are not trading in the misery of modern slavery, and penalties will ensure this. Penalties should include: a civil penalty provision for failure to report, with an immediate start date, focused on the fact of reporting rather than the content of the report, to give business time to build compliance procedures and gain familiarity with these new requirements; a civil penalty provision for submitting an inadequate report, with a delayed start date of two years from the date on which the bill receives royal assent; and a requirement that the minister report annually to the parliament on the companies that have failed to comply with the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders who provided evidence to the Senate inquiry into the bill also raised a number of further concerns, including the threshold for reporting. The reporting requirement in the bill will apply to entities with consolidated annual revenue of more than $100 million. Some stakeholders have called for a lower threshold of $25 million, to align with ASIC's definition of 'a large corporation', or $50 million, which is closer to the United Kingdom's model. Labor is committed to reviewing changes suggested by stakeholders at the Senate inquiry, including the threshold for reporting, as part of a three-year review provided for in section 24 of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clandestine nature of modern slavery makes it very difficult for authorities to detect, investigate and prosecute incidents when they occur, wherever they may occur. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. Modern slavery acts and similar legislation are currently in place, as I said, in the UK, France, the EU and some states of the US such as California. A modern slavery act will encourage businesses to take every step they can to put pressure on suppliers and notify authorities, as well as ensuring that they are more careful about checking who their suppliers are and what kind of labour practices they are engaged in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, despite the shortfalls in this bill, it is an important piece of legislation and this parliament needs to enact it for the best interests of our community and communities elsewhere in the world. Vigorous consultation with stakeholders, including NGOs, the business sector and departments, has made clear that modern slavery is an issue which needs to be dealt with immediately. I want to sincerely thank all of the stakeholders who made submissions and appeared before the law enforcement committee, the Senate committee and the joint foreign affairs committee, particularly the Law Council of Australia and its former president, Fiona McLeod; ACRATH and Christine Carolan from there; the Walk Free Foundation, particularly former Senator Chris Evans; and the Salvation Army Freedom Partnership, particularly Heather Moore, who has worked tirelessly on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Fuzz Kitto of STOP THE TRAFFIK and the petition that was received by Senator Penny Wong and our shadow justice minister, Clare O'Neil, on 13 November, signed by tens of thousands of people from around the world, calling on this Australian parliament to be a global leader against slavery by enacting a strong and effective modern slavery act. I understand that Fuzz presented that petition to Senator Penny Wong and to Ms Clare O'Neil on 13 November. Fuzz, as the national co-director of STOP THE TRAFFIK, was doing so as a response to members of its Australian coalition, which represents over 30 organisations working together to prevent, disrupt and abolish modern slavery. I understand that STOP THE TRAFFIK has been actively engaging with members and senators on all sides of politics, as well as with business, industry, non-government organisations and consumers on this issue of a modern slavery act for Australia. That petition that Senator Wong then presented to this Senate was signed by some 52,719 people from around Australia and the world, coordinated by Freedom United. It commends the Australian parliament for taking bold first steps towards creating a modern slavery law that could greatly impact the lives of millions of people working under conditions of forced labour. It went on to outline how, as we know all too well, many workers in Asia endure forced labour to bring us, as I said, the garments, the food, the electronics and other goods we enjoy. I am very pleased that Senator Wong presented that petition to this parliament and I thank STOP THE TRAFFIK for presenting it to Senator Wong to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more, of course, who have fought for this legislation to end slavery for many years. There is no doubt that this legislation, limited though it is, will drive corporate change and will have a positive impact on countries around the world. It will create a framework for business, government and civil society to address modern slavery. I want to congratulate members throughout this parliament, particularly our shadow minister, Ms Clare O'Neil, but also the chair of the foreign affairs committee inquiry, Mr Chris Crewther, from the other place, and indeed my Senate colleague Senator Linda Reynolds, with whom I had the pleasure of working closely on this issue. I understand how passionate she is about this issue and I share her passion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the work is not over, and Labor is not ready to stop working. We will ensure that we are doing all we can to fight this horrific practice, rather than leave the job half done. We do not accept modern slavery in any form, whether in Australia, the Indo-Pacific region or anywhere else throughout the world. We do not accept slavery in the supply chains of companies operating in Australia. That is why we must legislate to ensure that the tragic stories we have heard are never, ever repeated. It is abhorrent to me—it is abhorrent to so many in this place—that in this day and age, 2018, we still have to deal with issues of slavery and slavery-like practices. The reality is that there is modern slavery within our communities and indeed within our region. It is real, it is pervasive, it is everywhere. We must stamp it out. We must end this practice. It is abhorrent. I commend the bill in front of us today and hope it can be improved upon in time to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. My remarks will be brief, given the Senate's difficulties of late in debating and passing legislation that truly does matter. Although some members of the public may beg to differ, there are times that the parliament can pass legislation that is for the common good. The Modern Slavery Bill represents such legislation. While there have been some speed bumps along the way, Centre Alliance is committed to ensuring that this passes both houses of parliament this sitting fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 June 2018 following the extensive consultation process initiated by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade during its inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. The bill was then referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which tabled its report on 24 August 2018. The majority report contains six recommendations centred around reporting requirements imposed by the bill, the appointment of an independent statutory officer, matters to be considered by the legislative three-year review of the act, and references to existing modern slavery offences in Australia. As with many bills that come before the Senate, there's always room for improvement. Just how much the bill should be improved has been the subject of much debate and discussion, especially in the last three months—actually, especially in the last few weeks—in the backrooms of this building.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A range of aphorisms are relevant to the current circumstances: 'Perfect is the enemy of good'; 'Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without'; and—I say in my best Shakespeare voice!—'Striving to be better, oft we mar what's well'. And that may well be the first and last time you'll hear a submariner quoting Shakespeare! It is against this backdrop that I can indicate that Centre Alliance will not be supporting the amendments circulated by the opposition. The message we have been receiving loud and clear from some of the key stakeholders is that we are better off passing something this year, or else we risk delaying this legislation's coming into force for perhaps another 12 months. Centre Alliance has decided to focus on what outcomes can be achieved rather than what can't. Once passed, this bill will ensure that some of the biggest companies operating in Australia will be required by law to examine their supply chains for signs of modern slavery. If modern slavery is found, they must take steps to ensure that it does not continue. The significance of this cannot be underestimated. The lives of millions of people working under cruel and unsafe conditions stand to change for the better because of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some exchanges between Minister Reynolds and me in the last few committee stages, where I've called her out for being wrong. I don't resile from that, and I would always do that with any senator in this room. On the flip side, we must always recognise when the minister has done a fantastic job. In this case, I truly believe the minister has done some great work in getting this through not only the Senate and its crossbench but also her own party. I will put it on the record that we took her to the brink and then had to march back a little bit. But I think we've come to a reasonable compromise. Thank you, Minister. I would also like to acknowledge my former Senate colleague Skye Kakoschke-Moore. Skye has remained a special adviser to the International Justice Mission, and I hope she will be back here in July next year. I would also like to acknowledge Heather Moore. Her pragmatic approach helped ensure the best possible outcome could be achieved. I look forward to this bill passing and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I too would like to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. In terms of the Senate and in terms of the Australian parliament, it is a momentous occasion that we are debating this bill. As part of the committee inquiry looking into modern slavery, I had the experience, along with Senator Reynolds, of visiting the UK. From my own experiences in the North, and from the concerns around the businesses that we have, I know the questions that have been raised about the exploitation of workers. Going to the UK to examine the UK Modern Slavery Act provided enormous insights. But, even more than that, it is imperative for Australia to stand with the rest of the world in trying to combat slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and it should have been abolished a long time ago. Sadly, it hasn't been abolished. Sadly, there are way too many women, in particular, and children caught up in the vile norm of disempowerment of men, women and young children. In the UK, we heard Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne speak very strongly about why the UK act focused on having an antislavery commissioner. Senator Reynolds and the chair of the committee, Chris Crewther, were also able to see this. I know that it has been a bit of a journey to actually get this bill to this point, and I certainly commend you, Senator Reynolds, and the others who were on the committee with me that we are able to be here to discuss this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the UK, we heard of the profound importance of the role of that commissioner and the need for that commissioner. Yes, this is a first step, but Labor is very committed to ensuring that we go to the next step as well and have the commissioner role included in the bill. Strengthening the legislation around policing is necessary, and the ability of businesses to monitor themselves is critical, but it doesn't go far enough. I think we all accept that. I think we know that. Those are the areas that I will constantly focus on. The committee travelled as far away as the United Kingdom, and we were left with a really strong impression of what is important in legislation that comes before our parliament to ensure that slavery does not exist. We have to make sure that this bill has the teeth that it should have to send a very strong message right across this country and to any people across the seas who think that it is okay to enslave people in conditions that are abhorrent. We have to make sure that we're sending a very strong message. That is the next step and that is the place that I hope we will get to. Penalties and an independent commissioner are the steps that we have to aim for in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in the UK, we had the opportunity of also speaking with some of the businesses. One that really stayed with me was our visit to Sky UK and the time that we had there. I was quite impressed with the diligence of Ms Fiona Ball, who was the responsible business manager at the time. She gave us a very clear briefing on Sky UK and what they were doing, and not only in terms of the UK legislation on modern slavery. They were talking about the practical steps in how they look at their supply chain, and, again, it gave us a great insight into what is very possible and what should be possible for businesses in Australia. Sky UK talked to us about the fact that everything they do is recorded and monitored, right down to where they get their television screens from and where they get the material for establishing their studios and the flow-on effect of monitoring even those businesses who provide them with just an earpiece for the presenter sitting at the table. They follow the supply chain and make sure that the monitoring of that supply chain is consistent with the recommendations of the UK legislation. That is where Australia needs to get to. We need to make sure that our legislation enforces that kind of diligence on companies, that they are following the supply chain to make sure that there is no-one, not a single person, enslaved in the production of that product. That's where we need to get to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you've heard from previous speakers on this side, Labor will be moving amendments in relation to the areas of the bill that we see as needing to be strengthened. But I do, once again, want to commend the members of the committee whom I travelled with on this report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span>, and I would say to the Senate: it is well worth reading. Please, we've got to do more to stop slavery in this country.</span>

The bill might not be perfect in everybody's minds, but I think it is, as everybody here has said, a great step. So, Senator McKim, thank you very much for your contributions. I also thank Senator Singh and Senator McCarthy for their engagement when I was a member of the committee inquiring into this matter. It has been a labour of love and passion for many of us. I also thank Senator Patrick for his contributions and robust engagement in coming to this point, and Senator Storer, who has had significant engagement with this in the last few weeks. Despite our wide range of views, we all agree on the fundamental principle that modern slavery has absolutely no place anywhere in the world today, and particularly in our supply chains for the goods and services that Australians use every single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, the Hon. Alex Hawke MP, for initiating this bill and for taking into account the wide range of views presented in civil society and industry on combating this issue. I also pay tribute to my colleague Chris Crewther MP, who very ably and passionately chaired the inquiry into the establishment of a modern slavery act here in Australia. As Senator McCarthy has said, that committee produced one of the best reports in this period of parliament on this particular issue. It was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lain </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ight</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>Every member of the committee believed that title was very apt, as modern slavery is something that, while we might see evidence of it in our own communities—even here in Australia—is hidden in plain sight because, while we see it, we don't understand it for what it actually is. Without Chris Crewther's passion and commitment as chair of the subcommittee, we wouldn't be here talking about this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many civil society organisations that have also engaged in this process, and I notice there are a couple of people from those organisations here today in the gallery. I'd particularly like to thank Heather Moore, from the Salvation Army, for the amazing work that they have done at all stages of the inquiry, the reviews and the development of this bill, and Fuzz and Carolyn Kitto, from STOP THE TRAFFIK, who have worked tirelessly to make sure we got to this day. I sincerely thank them, Save the Children and the many other organisations that have worked so collaboratively together. I also thank the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that inquired into this bill, which was very ably led by my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald. As he said in this place, the committee put a lot of serious consideration and thought into this report, and the government has largely adopted the committee's recommendations. The Modern Slavery Bill 2018 is a critical milestone in our response to this heinous practice. When legislated, this act will build greater transparency by shining a light into the length and breadth of the global supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The term 'modern slavery' is used to describe a range of activities. We're not talking about the unfair labour practices and fair pay for a fair day's work; we're not talking about that aspect of labour laws. We are talking about the most serious deprivation of individual liberty and individual freedoms—servitude. Modern slavery today encompasses human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices, servitude, forced marriage and forced labour. Each of these on its own is a serious exploitative practice and a grave violation of human rights, and they simply have no place in the world today. Just as fundamentally, modern slavery practices are a denial of individual liberties and democratic freedoms. Bonded labour, indebted servitude and trafficking are all the most gross violations of personal freedoms and individual rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today slavery rarely involves chains or obvious physical control over victims—although, sadly, in some places there is evidence that chains still do exist. Those who exploit others in this way typically use more subtle forms of coercion, such as threats and deception, to maintain power over their victims, who are some of the most vulnerable and powerless in the world today. The United Nations International Labour Organization estimates that there are at least 40 million people around the world caught up in modern slavery. Of the victims, at least 25 million are exploited in global supply chains, including at least 16 million in the private sector supply chains, and about 15 million in forced marriage. Sadly, our region is also the global epicentre of modern slavery, with about two-thirds of victims situated in our Asia-Pacific region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exploitation of people, sadly, is a highly lucrative business. Slavery alone generates more than $190 billion annually, globally. I will say that again: $190 billion annually. Every single dollar of that is on the back of the exploitation of other people. That $190 billion every year is more than the combined profit of Apple, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Microsoft and Facebook combined. The personal and human cost to people who have been subject to this abuse is immeasurable. There are many industries at risk of having modern slavery in their supply chains, including garment manufacturing, mining, seafood, construction, electronics and agriculture. Awareness of the problem globally is gradually increasing, and international efforts to combat it are gaining momentum. I would particularly like to congratulate and thank the Walk Free Foundation and their founder, Andrew Forrest, for really driving a lot of the global awareness of modern slavery and harnessing a desire to tackle it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government also recognises that this is a global problem, and it's not confined to the poorest nations in the globe. Edmund Burke once remarked that slavery is a weed which grows on every soil. But slavery is not just something that Australians contribute to unknowingly when they buy their clothes, when they eat their food and when they use their electronic devices. It also exists here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, I would particularly like to say to the Senate how personally happy and delighted I am that, with the passage of this legislation, Australia will become the first country to acknowledge, and seek that companies look for, the practice of trafficking of children into foreign orphanages to be enslaved, with the orphanages earning money from us. It was during a visit to Cambodia in 2016 with Save the Children that I became aware of the issue of voluntourism, with thousands and thousands of Australians unwittingly supporting the institutionalisation of vulnerable children in so-called orphanages that get money from us when we volunteer. It is perverse, it is evil and we have a responsibility to fix it. Again, like the UK has found with the introduction of their Modern Slavery Act, modern slaves are often hidden in plain sight—and not just in the UK, the US and across the EU. We have people in slavery here in Australia today. They are working on our farms, sometimes in our shopping centres, in nail bars and in massage parlours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia already does have a legislative framework and criminal justice arrangements to deal with these sorts of crimes domestically, including specialist police investigative teams, a dedicated victim support program and comprehensive criminal offences. Here in Australia, specialist police investigative teams have received more than 800 referrals for suspected modern slavery crimes right here in Australia. A dedicated visa framework has already provided over 150 victims and family members with permanent residency in Australia. However, what our existing legislative framework lacks is a mechanism to directly target modern slavery in global supply chains, or methods to support the business community to take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian business and industry are exposed to modern slavery risks, but they also have enormous influence and enormous power to address these risks and to cultivate change. In developing the bill, the government worked closely with business as well as civil society, including 16 consultation roundtables with more than 170 businesses and civil society proponents. We've had more than 50 targeted meetings with key stakeholders and provided targeted exposure of the draft bill with more than 40 stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to some of the comments from those opposite, while many in this chamber are so ready to demonise this sort of phantom concept of big business, what they actually forget is that working in each and every one of these Australian businesses are everyday Australians who want to do the right thing. People in these companies, Australians in these companies, are absolutely appalled to think that their business practices and what they do, and the goods they source from overseas, are the result of slavery. I have found nothing but cooperation and engagement from every aspect of the business sector, because not only is it good business but it is also the right thing for them to do. And, in fact, more than 90 per cent of the submissions on the government's consultation process were overwhelmingly positive about this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The centrepiece of this legislation is the introduction of an annual modern slavery reporting requirement for large corporations and other entities, like universities and large charities. The reporting requirement will apply to around 3,000 entities in the Australian market with annual global revenue above a $100,000 threshold. It will apply to all Australian businesses as well as foreign businesses with operations in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mandatory reporting requirements include the entity's structure; operations and supply chains; potential modern slavery risks; actions they're taking to address those risks; and how entities themselves are assessing the effectiveness of their actions. Importantly, and I believe a global first, this reporting requirement will also apply to the Commonwealth government. So, not only is this government asking others to take these important steps; we're also asking ourselves and making sure that within the federal government we also comply in our own supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These modern slavery statements will be published on a central website so they are accessible to the public, investors and business peers. This promotes transparency and ensures the community can easily access them. And I believe, and as others have said in this chamber again today, that market scrutiny and increased awareness will drive positive and virtuous behavioural change, and this is all designed to promote a race to the top as investors and consumers reward positive business engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reporting requirement will be reviewed after three years to ensure that the legislation remains best practice and continues to evolve in line with international developments. However, we recognise this is an important and a significant change for business, which is why the government is establishing a $3.6 million expert modern slavery business engagement unit in the Department of Home Affairs to provide advice on how to comply with the legislation but also, if they find slavery, to provide advice and assistance on how they can go about dealing with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most non-compliance over the first three years of reporting will be due to a lack of awareness from business. That is clearly the experience and the advice from the United Kingdom. Initially, their lower compliance reporting rates were not deliberate; it was really because many of their 8,000 companies did not know how to address it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that we're moving today will ensure that the bill includes a clear pathway to future penalties if required. The amendments will explicitly require the three-year review of the reporting requirement to consider compliance rates and whether additional compliance rates are actually required. Lastly, the reporting requirement is subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation by the parliament, which is only right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Australia has dedicated more than 15 years of consecutive regional aid investment to combat human trafficking in our region and we continue to place a high priority on regional engagement in forums, including through the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. As my colleagues in this chamber have acknowledged today, the passage of this modern slavery bill into law is the next step forward for Australia in combating trafficking and slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global nature of modern slavery demands a global response, and no one country alone will ever be able to address this scourge. This modern slavery act will set a clear standard for action, which will help Australia deliver tangible results, and result in the freedom from slavery for many, many people here and also overseas. I would like to conclude with the words of William Wilberforce: 'You may choose to look the other way, but you can never, ever again say you did not know.' Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Protecting the community, and keeping Australians safe and secure is the greatest priority for any parliament and for any government. It's a commitment that I share and this government shares with Crime Stoppers Australia, particularly when it comes to local community safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crime Stoppers is a wonderful organisation. It is a state-by-state organisation that's predominantly volunteer-led. It's set up to assist state police forces directly with information gathered from local community reporting on suspicious behaviour, wanted criminals or drug dealers in their community, because police and any other law enforcement agency cannot be on every street corner and in every house, and no-one knows their local communities like the residents do themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our law enforcement organisations would leave many investigations open without the vital information that they receive from communities and that volunteers collect to pass on. As the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, I want to thank the many volunteers that man the phones in each and every state and territory Crime Stoppers office. Your work, I think, all too often goes unnoticed and unthanked, but today I'm here to thank you all for the vital work you do for all of our local communities. You are a vital link between law enforcement, the criminal justice system and your local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, I was delighted to attend the Grovelands Primary School in the city of Armidale in the great state of Western Australia to launch the WA Dob in a Dealer campaign. Since 2015, Crime Stoppers Australia has received almost $5 million for various projects on an ongoing operation, including the Dob in a Dealer campaign. This campaign fights the impacts of both drug use and drug dealing by seeking Australian community support to report individuals suspected of dealing in illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine or ice. Research from the 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey on ice looked at the data by geographic region. It showed 55 per cent of drug users lived in outer regional, remote and very remote locations, 52 per cent lived in major cities and 39 per cent lived in inner regional areas. The problem is nation wide. It is in every suburb and in every community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last Dob in a Dealer campaign in 2016 had remarkable results. It saw an average increase of 95 per cent in drug related information reports to Crime Stoppers nationally. That included an increase of 143 per cent in the number of amphetamine related reports that came in from the public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home state of Western Australia, there was a 49 per cent increase in the drug related information reported through Crime Stoppers. However, a worrying sign is that Western Australians were more than twice as likely to have used ice in the previous 12 months compared to every other state and territory. So we must ensure the success and continuation of this particular program. Clearly, the program is working and making a real and tangible difference, not only in my home state but also in vulnerable communities right across our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has committed a further $1 million from the proceeds of crime funds to contribute to this Dob in a Dealer campaign. The Commonwealth funding is also being used to facilitate Crime Stoppers engagement in the Asia-Pacific region and to support awareness-raising initiatives of Crime Stoppers' function, including campaigns in culturally and linguistically diverse communities to increase engagement within these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the numbers are quite astonishing. Crime Stoppers receive a call, on average, every 100 seconds, all day, every day. The information that they obtain from the community results in almost 22 arrests each and every day. This is a clear indication of the success to be had when the community work together with local law enforcement to keep their community safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the light of this success, the Australian government has committed a further $1 million for a second phase of this program through Crime Stoppers. And—I think, particularly fittingly—the program is funded from the assets confiscated by the Commonwealth as proceeds of crime, money that once was destined to line the pockets of our most serious criminals in this country. The government, in conjunction with Crime Stoppers, is committed to disrupting the importation, manufacture and supply of illicit drugs in Australia—particularly, as I said, in our local communities. They have simply devastating effects and impacts on local communities, on individuals, on families and on their friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are faced with a challenging and very rapidly evolving threat environment in transnational and serious and organised crime. Technology has provided criminals and malicious actors with new and unprecedented means to undermine our sovereignty and to do harm to local communities, to business and also to critical infrastructure. In establishing Home Affairs, the federal government is now delivering greater coordination and connection between all of the portfolio agencies, which is enabling information sharing and enhanced results against a wide range of criminality that plagues our nation, whether it be terrorism, violent extremism, foreign interference and espionage or transnational, serious and organised crime—and, of course, the rapidly increasing threat of cybercrime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Home Affairs agencies are working in close collaboration with state and territory counterparts. We couldn't tackle any of those without that close cooperation. Within that framework, Crime Stoppers are one of our most important and key partners. Crime Stoppers are proven to be a trusted and vital connection between the community, the media and law enforcement in solving and preventing crime. All Australians expect effective responses to crime when it happens, but preventing crime in the first place is always the preferred option. Crime prevention initiatives are an important element of the government strategy to keep all of us safe in our homes and in our local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also recognises the important role that local councils and community organisations play in disrupting crime, complementing the work of government agencies and also organisations like Crime Stoppers. Since 2013, this government has announced funding of more than $150 million for local crime prevention programs. That includes funding for projects such as $50 million for the Safer Streets Program. That has gone to fund security infrastructure projects such as closed-circuit TV and lighting to support local areas experiencing problems with criminal behaviour or antisocial behaviour and also to improve community safety through projects such as Neighbourhood Watch Australasia and Youth Off The Streets. In addition to this funding, we've committed $70 million under the Safer Communities Fund, which has already supported more than 200 projects around our nation to upgrade security infrastructure—as I said, things like CCTV and enhanced lighting—and environmental design initiatives to help prevent crime in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion: I am very proud today to be the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, with responsibility for programs such as this. There are so many ways to serve our local communities. Many men and women across our country give their time, their passion and their commitment to work for Crime Stoppers. That is something we should recognise in this place, and we should thank them all. So congratulations and thank you again to Crime Stoppers, who are deeply committed and give their time and their commitment to making their local communities a much safer place. Thank you.</span>

                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:54):</span>  Last week I was in the Pilbara, in Karratha, to listen to the impact that financial institutions, particularly banks, administrators and liquidators, have had on local people during the boom and bust associated with the mining boom. Labor's been holding roundtables across the country to give people who've found themselves to be victims at the hands of the banks an opportunity to tell their story. Up in Karratha I held two small roundtables and then a larger meeting. We heard the most alarming and concerning evidence from people about how disgracefully the banks—in particular, Westpac—had behaved. I thank all the people who told us their stories. I acknowledge how difficult it is to tell your personal financial story—how it's affected you, your family, your life and your businesses. So thank you to those who came along. I'd also like to thank the Pilbara Community Legal Service for the statements they gave us of the people they've assisted. I particularly want to thank Labor's member in the Pilbara, Kevin Michel, who, along with his team, got those people along to tell their stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said at the outset that I did this because the banking royal commission hasn't heard from many—just 26, I believe—of the individuals whose lives have been affected by the disgraceful behaviour of the banks. I would urge the Morrison government to give the royal commission more time, and I would ask the royal commission to visit the Pilbara, because I think this region has a particular story to tell. Sadly, I doubt that the Morrison government is going to extend the time of the royal commission, because this government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the establishment of the commission. In fact, Melissa Price, the member for Durack, voted 26 times against the establishment of a royal commission—a royal commission that Labor pushed for, which was eventually established. And remember: it was our Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, who said that the call for a royal commission was a 'populist whinge'. He went on further to say that Labor's call 'threatened to undermine a key pillar of the Australian economy'. He described our attempts to establish the royal commission as 'reckless political games'. He, Mr Morrison, along with the member for Durack, Melissa Price, voted against the establishment of the royal commission 26 times. It just shows you how out of touch they are with the issues and concerns of ordinary Australians, particularly those in Ms Price's electorate of Durack and those living in Karratha.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some of the people I met and put their stories on the record here. Some of them are exclusive as to the sorts of extremes we've seen in the Pilbara. A gentleman came to see us who runs a large family business. He wanted to extend the business. He wanted to buy another business, worth about $4.5 million. At that particular time, Westpac offered this family $50 million. There was no business plan, there were no documents, there was no business case—nothing—just a verbal agreement: 'Here, have $50 million.' That's how much cash was floating around in the Pilbara during the boom. So he took it. Later, when the paperwork came, Westpac was going to charge him an interest rate of—wait for it—16 per cent. That is 16 per cent on $50 million. Can you imagine? This gentleman took his matter to the Ombudsman, who, he said, was weak and pretty toothless. The Ombudsman at that point negotiated a $10,000 payment, but of course this gentleman told him where he could put that. We know that, on this occasion, Westpac didn't adhere to its own code of conduct. This matter went to the bank's internal complaints department, but there has been no real resolution of this matter, and it remains a live matter today, where Westpac initially offered $50 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard some common themes from the people we spoke to. We heard that money was just given out like confetti. I can't think of any other way to describe it. There was never any paperwork or any kind of business plan—nothing. In fact, one gentleman told us that, at the height of the boom, the Pilbara, Karratha, had four loan managers. That's how keen they were to give people money and put them into debt. The bank manager would often ring him up and say, 'Hey, mate, we haven't really met our KPIs on fixed term; can I offer you a fixed term?' It was as though it was some commodity being traded backwards and forwards. Money was just being thrown at people with gay abandon. I have to say that, after hearing this story, I was pretty gobsmacked—but there was worse to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then heard from a not-for-profit who had money that the state government had given him to set up—funding of $2 million—and they owned property, and yet the bank took four months to secure a loan, which obviously cost that NGO a lot of money. We heard the story of a woman and her husband who had built during the boom in Karratha—so they paid a premium for the house they built—and they also bought an investment property. Sadly, seven years ago, her husband contracted cancer and died quite suddenly. This woman is a JP and a marriage celebrant and a long-term resident of Karratha. All of these people are long-term residents of Karratha. Without any paperwork, without any payslips, without any investigation into this woman's capacity to pay, the bank simply transferred that debt. Despite working four jobs, there was no way she could pay the $4,500 a month that Westpac was charging her for the two mortgages. Eventually, after grinding herself down, this woman had no option but to declare bankruptcy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As some of us in this chamber would know, if you're going to be a JP and a marriage celebrant, you have to be a fit and proper person. So, suddenly, because she was bankrupt, not only did she lose the home she had shared with her husband, lose the investment property and have massive debt; she also lost her livelihood, because she lost her licence to be a marriage celebrant and she lost the ability to be a JP. Thankfully, this woman, who now lives with her family, because she has no ability to pay anything or to take out any loans because she is a bankrupt, was able to fight to re-secure her JP licence and her ability to be a marriage celebrant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the banks well and truly preyed on people in Karratha. It seemed there was a loans department where everything was hunky-dory and you were offered the world, and then there was the hardship department, which really didn't do much for people. Nobody in Karratha had a good word to say about the hardship department. Then there were the credit managers, once you got into a bit of difficulty. In fact, the gentleman who was given $50 million by Westpac was told by the bank, 'It doesn't help your cause to take us to the ombudsman.' Threats and intimidation were common themes in the stories that I heard in the Pilbara. One man told us that, after the bank's credit department went after him, he spoke to a receiver who said, 'I'm a mad dog and I'll come after you and eat you up unless you give me $150,000.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how the banks have been behaving, completely unfettered, whether it's handing out money or forcing people into bankruptcy, in the Pilbara. Yet this government, the Morrison government, and Melissa Price, the member for Durack, voted 26 times against a royal commission. It's best summed up by a young man who gave us a written submission. He is a finance broker. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's much more than a populist whinge. It's about our values as a nation and whether we want to sell out so completely to economic rationalism that we lose sight of the fact that we owe each other and every one of our fellow citizens our support and love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And he is a finance broker. So we know banks can behave differently. The commission needs to be extended.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  This Saturday, 1 December, is World AIDS Day, a day held every year to raise awareness across the world and in the community about the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS, a day for people to show support for people living with AIDS and HIV, and a day to remember those who we have lost. It's also a day for people to learn about HIV, to take action to reduce the transmission of HIV and to support people in our community who are living with HIV and ensure they can live and participate fully in our community, free from stigma and discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to say that HIV infection is declining amongst men who have sex with men, and this is due to the rise of the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis, otherwise known as PrEP. In one trial in New South Wales, HIV infections declined by almost one-third, and the declines were highest amongst Australian-born men and those living in the 'gay' suburbs of inner Sydney. However, reductions among non-English speaking immigrants were lower: for example, there was only a 21 per cent decline for men born in Asia. But the most concerning statistic was that we've seen a 33 per cent increase in new HIV diagnosis rates amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, compared with the 22 per cent decrease in newly diagnosed HIV rates amongst Australian-born non-Indigenous people. This is attributed to higher proportions of Indigenous people with HIV going undiagnosed and the low uptake of PrEP. In fact, of the almost 17,000 people in PrEP trials in Australia, only around 200 are Indigenous. This disparity must be fixed. We need targeted efforts to encourage the uptake of PrEP in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. We also need to ensure that the needs of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including brotherboys, sistergirls, and gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, are met in public health prevention efforts and service provision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we've seen some good progress in the overall decline of HIV rates in Australia, the fact remains that stigma for people living with HIV remains a real issue, particularly for those in the LGBTIQ+ community. Reducing stigma leads to more people getting tested, and early testing is essential for the elimination of HIV. There is a very important role for government to play in this. I commend the listing of PrEP on the PBS and would like to acknowledge the massive community campaign and the hard work of LGBTIQ advocacy organisations and activists, and health organisations, that led to this. Without this listing, PrEP would have remained prohibitively expensive, costing around $5,000 per year. Its listing will continue to reduce HIV transmission, but what's also needed is further government resourcing of interventions, such as testing and culturally appropriate education programs, if we are to end the transmission of HIV in Australia. The Greens will continue to advocate for federal action to address HIV and continue to fight the stigma that people with HIV experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stigma of HIV is strongly linked to the still ongoing stigma of being same-sex attracted and outdated attitudes that the disease is due to being gay, and, in some circles, still presented as punishment for being gay. Stigma, of course, is strongly connected with discrimination. Where legal and illegal discrimination against same-sex-attracted and gender-diverse people continue, people feel lesser. They feel that they have to struggle with their sexuality and gender identity, rather than feeling valued and respected in society for who they are and feeling they can be out and proud. So removing HIV stigma starts with removing discrimination against LGBTIQ+ people, and a good place to start is in schools, ensuring that LGBTIQ+ students feel safe and respected for who they are. The government needs to step up to make sure that this is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just on home turf that the Australian government needs to step up. We need the government to be doing more to advance the rights of LGBTIQ+ people globally. While marriage equality has been at the forefront of media attention in Australia and while marriage equality is legalised now in 26 countries, the reality is that, for many LGBTIQ people around the world, being who they are is a risk to personal safety; living freely is only a dream; violence and discrimination are daily occurrences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week voters in Taiwan rejected same-sex marriage in a referendum. While Taiwan is more progressive than other Asian countries in terms of LGBTIQ rights—with some legal prohibition against discrimination in work and education and with transgender people being allowed to change their legal gender—the result of this referendum is devastating. My heart goes out to all the Taiwanese people who were hopeful that this reform would be an important step towards equality, and we will continue to stand with Taiwanese LGBTIQ+ communities until they achieve this important reform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But things are worse elsewhere. In 73 countries worldwide, including in our Asia-Pacific region, consensual sex between same-sex adults is illegal, and punishments range from fines and imprisonment to the death penalty. In the last 12 months or so, our other close neighbours have cracked down on LGBTIQ people. In Indonesia there have been raids on gay bars, and in 2017 more than 200 LGBTIQ people were arrested under a law enacted to target them. In Malaysia, punishments facing LGBTIQ people are severe, including fines, prison sentences and even caning. This year two women were convicted for attempting to have sex in a car parked in a public area and were caned before an audience in a courtroom. Human Rights Watch notes discrimination against LGBTIQ people is pervasive in Malaysia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, the marginalisation of LGBTIQ communities fuels the rates of HIV and AIDS. In 2007, the Malaysian Minister of Health was banned from advocating the use of condoms to prevent the spread of the disease due to a concern that this would imply an endorsement of sexual conduct outside of marriage. And there's a correlation: countries where homosexuality is illegal are countries with elevated rates of HIV. Where homosexuality is criminalised, men are much more likely to avoid HIV testing and less likely to learn about safer sexual practices. Criminalisation also destroys LGBTIQ networks and communities, and therefore the ability to implement HIV prevention strategies. Australia's strong LGBTIQ networks and community have been acknowledged as one of the most important elements in our success in reducing HIV transmission compared to many other countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also very concerning LGBTIQ rights abuses in Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia, and there's the attempted rollback of LGBTIQ rights under the Trump administration, including the push to ban transgender people from the military and removing protection for transgender prison inmates. In Brazil, of course, there is a newly elected president who has declared that he is a proud homophobe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also, looking more positively, need to acknowledge and celebrate the positive steps and achievements we've made globally in achieving and advancing LGBTIQ rights. There are five countries in the world that have constitutions that explicitly guarantee equality for citizens on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and five countries whose constitutions provide protections based on sexual orientation, and the number of these countries is only going to continue to grow. Just a month ago in India, the British colonial era law banning homosexuality was struck down. Thousands of people marched to celebrate, chanting, 'We got our freedom!' One of the marchers said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It will take one more generation for social acceptance, but the fear factor is gone. I'm enjoying my life as a free citizen now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing LGBTIQ activists emboldened around the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge our government to build on the good work they are already doing both in our region and globally to advance LGBTI rights as well as in HIV protection. Since the 1980s Australia has taken a range of measures to achieve a sustained low prevalence of HIV and AIDS. Federal and state governments responded proactively in 1982 once HIV was identified. This was a cross-party response, and it was only possible by putting people's needs above politics. There were often many controversial programs that were implemented and, most importantly, we publicly talked about the risk factors for HIV transmission. Australian communities mobilised to prevent HIV transmission. We were able to do it in Australia. We were able to work with the communities most affected. We can help make it happen around the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I rise this afternoon to honour those who have served our nation in our defence forces and to recognise the historical significance of this year, which is the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice. Earlier this month, I had the distinct pleasure of attending events to mark the centenary of the armistice, two of which I would like to highlight today. The first was hosted jointly by the Naval Association of Australia Perth North Subsection and Wanneroo RSL Sub-Branch, and the other was hosted by the Returned Services League's Highgate RSL Sub-Branch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event held in Wanneroo's Memorial Park featured a presentation symbolic of the moments leading up to the cessation of hostilities. Riflemen took up position at the memorial and at two other points in the local area. Blank shots were fired from these points in a symbolic descending order—three rounds from each of the three locations, two rounds from each location and then one round from each location. Immediately following the crack of the final shot, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Last Post</span> started. One bugler played at the memorial and the other buglers played at the three other locations in the area. It's hard to convey exactly what it was like to be there, but it was truly moving and I'm sure that's a sentiment shared by the many locals who also attended. I sincerely thank Mr Graeme Woodford, President of the Naval Association of Australia Perth North Sub-Branch, and Mr Jack Le Cras, President of the Wanneroo RSL Sub-Branch, and their respective organisations, for extending an invitation for me to attend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other event I wish to highlight was the Centenary of Armistice luncheon hosted by the Highgate RSL Sub-branch, held at the State Reception Centre in Kings Park, with special guest the Hon. Kim Beazley AC, the Governor of Western Australia. The luncheon followed a formal Remembrance Day service to launch the Remembrance Walk project and the Virtual Memorial Project and thank the Department of Veterans' Affairs for supporting and funding the projects. The Remembrance Walk project brings wartime heritage into the digital age. The application communicates the historical significance of each of the 29 war memorials in Kings Park in the context of Australia's military service over the last 100 years and beyond. The application includes historical photographs and accounts of each memorial, access to information relating to the wartime campaigns and military units, and links to the veterans' associations and the Australian War Memorial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Virtual Memorial project aims to digitise all war memorials in Western Australia and provide public access to the names and biographical details of the soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen commemorated on them. Starting at the State War Memorial for World War I, the project's mission was to list, and provide details about, every name inscribed on the memorial by the Centenary of Armistice. Upon completion, the project was expanded to include those named on the State War Memorial for World War II and all subsequent military conflicts. The digitised memorial includes biographical details from the Australian War Memorial, the National Archives of Australia, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the nominal rolls of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Further research connected with this project has revealed names that should be added to the State War Memorial. This project has preserved—and, in some cases, uncovered—the legacy of those who were, or should have been, listed on the State War Memorial and made it accessible to the public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to extend my thanks and the thanks of many others to the Remembrance Walk project's director Lieutenant Colonel Steve Chamarette (Rtd), and the Virtual Memorial project's director Group Captain Ian Petkoff AM (Rtd) for their invaluable contribution to the community of Western Australia. Their efforts will ensure Australia's military history and service records are safe, secure and accessible by all, well into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to an important point. Why is it that we, as a country, as a land of free people, commemorate those who fought, and remember those who fell, in service of our great nation and its values? I would like to share with you something that I saw on that particular day. On the back of the Centenary of Armistice Remembrance Day program, there was a harrowing quote from a former Prime Minister of Australia, Mr John Curtin. This quote from Mr Curtin was written by Mr Curtin in November 1918, almost two decades before he, a proud Western Australian, became the Prime Minister of this great nation. In November 1918, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For more than four terrible years the tumultuous flames of war have lit the sky with death … History has no parallel to the destruction that has been occasioned. The toll demanded of life and limb; the price paid in anguish of spirit and bafflement of high hope; the tears; the suffering; the terrific mortality of actual combatants; the actual and potential devitalising of civilisation itself, is too vast a computation for living men to make … Tomorrow must assuredly be a better and fairer day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the words of a proud Western Australian, a great Western Australian indeed, a former Prime Minister, made almost two decades before he led our nation into terrible conflict. This is a deeply stirring and emotive quote. Let's take a step back and reflect on what it was that John Curtin was talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great War, the First World War, saw over 330,000 Australians serve overseas and around 60,000 never returned. The social impact on a young country like Australia, with its small population, was absolutely enormous. It touched every Australian life. Almost every person, family and community suffered some kind of loss. For example, in my home state of Western Australia, we played an especially important and significant role in our country's first and most significant military endeavour. Albany, a small town on the south of our great Western Australian coastline, was the final departure point for the first convoy of soldiers to leave Australia, including those who had come from New Zealand. Over 30,000, approximately 10 per cent, of Western Australia's resident population enlisted to serve. For a small population, Western Australians should be proud that 10 of our soldiers received the Victoria Cross, the highest military honour awarded for acts of bravery. On those numbers, WA contributed a higher proportion than any other state in Australia. Every Australian has reason to reflect on what this meant for a small community and a country populated as sparsely as Australia was at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia at large, there were nearly 272,000 Australians who survived in the war and 170,000 suffered from wounds or illness. But not all injuries were physical. Even as the guns on the Western Front fell silent, for many Australians the effects of the First World War never stopped. The memories, scars and nightmares remained with them for the rest of their lives. The term 'shell-shocked' was used to describe the condition of soldiers who had suffered mental breakdown, a condition where a person would be stuck in a constant state of fear and anxiety. We now know this condition by its modern name, post-traumatic stress disorder. But, back then, the psychological scars were so often left untreated due to the limited knowledge of psychiatry at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">War and conflict have a unique impact on those who experience them and on the families of those who return from them. The government and civil society groups across Australia, like the Returned and Services League, continue to provide for veterans and their families to honour their service and commitment to our nation. Referring back to Curtin's reflection on war, I extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to every Returned and Services League branch across Australia, particularly to the Wanneroo RSL and the Highgate RSL, for the continuous work they do to remember, reflect and ultimately reward the loss and sacrifice made by so many others in the name of our great Commonwealth, Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  Tomorrow this parliament will table a report that will lead to what I hope will be a very courageous, brave, bold, visionary direction in terms of First Nations policy, representation and influence since 1967. I will not pre-empt the findings of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, but I do want to speak a little bit about the important journey we have been on to reach this point and the road we will travel towards the establishment of an Indigenous voice to the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect on my story with the Yanyuwa and Garrwa peoples. I speak now so that I can encourage senators and members in the other place to prepare to look and listen to the importance of First Nations voices in this country. I am deeply honoured to work beside Senator Pat Dodson on this journey, along with Linda Burney, the member for Barton, and also Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari, as we have travelled across the country along with many other members of this committee. But I reflect on where I come from as a Yanyuwa-Garrwa woman in this instance—that is, as the Yanyuwa people we are known as li-Anthawirriyarra, which means our spiritual origin comes from the sea country. That means that our decisions, our debates, our happiness and our sadness come back to li-Anthawirriyarra, to our sense of spirit and place as First Nations people. We have what is known as the kujika, and the kujika is the songline, the journey, of our stories, of members of the clans of the Yanyuwa, the Rrumburriya, the Mambaliya, the Wuyaliya, the Wurdaliya. We are the clans of the li-Anthawirriyarra and we hold the kujika, the songline, very strongly. Everyone has a songline for the Yanyuwa. We all have a journey to walk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament has a journey with the First Nations people, and an ongoing journey, a part of the continuing journey of First Nations people in this country, and I ask senators and members to check with their spirit, li-Anthawirriyarra, when they come together to talk about empowering the voices of First Nations people in this country. It is significant that you use that not just to stand and talk with words that have no meaning but to stand and talk with words that come from the heart, because that is how First Nations people speak. That is the story we ask the parliament, the Senate, the House of Representatives, to hear, to empower our voices. And whilst, as Indigenous members of this parliament, we can be heard, there are thousands and thousands of First Nations people out there who need to be heard, and this process has been enormously important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been 10 years since the issue of constitutional recognition was first raised. First Nations people have made clear that their preferred form of meaningful recognition is a voice to parliament, and we cannot ignore those calls. The convention brought together 250 First Nations delegates from around the country at Uluru, on Anangu land. Anangu mob have a name for their songline. They call it Tjukurpa. The Yanyuwa call it kujika. It was remarkable—the gathering on Anangu country. It brought the spirit and the strength of First Nations people together in their calls for their voices to be heard in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Discussions at the convention built upon a discussion paper produced by the council and it reflected on the diversity of views raised by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in consultative dialogues with the Referendum Council during the previous six months of last year. The majority resolved in the Statement from the Heart to call for the establishment of a First Nations voice in the Australian Constitution and a makarrata commission to supervise the process of agreement-making and truth-telling between governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Makarrata is the meaning of two groups coming together after conflict. It's the space and time where there has been so much conflict that you need to come together. That is the Yolngu word—'makarrata'. We have another word in Yanyuwa. But the meaning is to come together after conflict, to sit down, to work through and to agree that peace and prosperity for both sides is the way forward. Truth-telling is equally significant as part of that. And I urge senators and members to think very carefully, and again, through the spirit, li-Anthawirriyarra, in preparation for these conversations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and now the Scott Morrison government have not supported the voice to parliament, and that disappointment came two months after the announcement at Uluru. But what individual members of these two houses of the parliament have chosen to do—including members of the government and the Greens and Independents—is to come together, to walk together, to revive and keep alive the respect that is required for the voice. We will be able to speak in more detail once that is tabled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is certainly our priority for constitutional change, and there is a deeper message. For the people of the Northern Territory: we have seen and we have heard the conversations around constitutional rights. We saw the Wave Hill walk-off and the push for wage justice, followed by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, followed by the Yanyuwa, who were the first under the Northern Territory land rights act to push for land. We know that the bark petition from Barunga, presented to Prime Minister Bob Hawke at the time, was an important statement then by First Nations people across the Northern Territory calling on this parliament to listen and to work and engage in a very sincere way with First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is all part of this journey—the history and the politics. The journey is the kujika. So I remind all members that this side of the house calls on you to talk with your heart when that report is tabled.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I had intended to raise a matter of pressing public importance today, but something has trumped that. I feel very disturbed by some of the comments that were made in this chamber this morning in regard to a notable and obvious decline in standards in this chamber. It's very hard and galling to be accused of falsehoods. It is very galling to listen to the pious words mouthed by the Leader of the Australian Greens party, Senator Di Natale, and want to gag, because they ring so falsely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, Senator Di Natale tried to turn his blatant and flagrant disregard for the authority of the President and the rules of the Senate into a virtue—into somehow his own strength and courage in levelling personal abuse at others. It was nothing less than an abject disgrace. He sought to blame the individual who withdrew their comments as soon as they were drawn to their attention as inappropriate. He sought to blame for dysfunction the individual who did the right thing by acknowledging that the wrong thing had been done. And then today he dresses it up, suggesting it is because there is rampant sexism and misogyny happening in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'm calling that out as a load of baloney. I've had enough of it, because the identity politics that is being played out in this place is reducing the ability for us to do our jobs. Yesterday I heard a Labor senator say that it was sexist when an Independent senator denied leave for a procedural matter in here, because the tone he had used in saying no was somehow sexist. I'm tired of those in the Greens feeling free to level whatever personal abuse they like, whether it be about someone's religion, their skin colour, their age, their sex or where they come from. They can level those sorts of abuses at will and there's nothing wrong with it, but God forbid you actually call one of these people out for their failings, for their falsehoods, for their fictions!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They hide behind the mask of identity politics. Every time Senator Faruqi gets up, she's calling everyone else a racist because some of us in this place are critical of radical Islam. Well, Islam isn't a race, but apparently we're all racists. Every time we say that Senator Hanson-Young has done the wrong thing by misusing taxpayers' money and failing to repay it, or taking whale-watching trips with her family, she hides behind identity politics, saying, 'You're picking on me because I'm a mother; you're picking on me because I'm a woman.' When you ask Senator Hanson-Young to withdraw the vile homophobic slurs that she's levelled at others in this place, she denies having made them until the evidence is produced, and then she goes, 'I withdraw; I did say that.' We're calling these people out for their bad actions—not because of their gender but because of their own conduct. As I look around this place, I don't see a man or a woman or a transgender or a this or a that; what I see is senators. Each senator needs to be held to account, but we're getting to a point where all of a sudden you're not allowed to criticise behaviour or conduct or ideas that you disagree with because pejorative slurs will get levelled at you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the sanctimonious hypocrisy of that in evidence this morning. Let's understand exactly what happened yesterday. Senator Di Natale referred to another senator in an appalling manner, an unparliamentary manner. That's not unheard of in this place, but when it is heard the request is made to withdraw the remark. Common courtesy dictates you withdraw the remark because of your breach of the standards we accept here. Senator Di Natale thought that, somehow, he'd be the new incarnation of former Senator Bob Brown and refuse to do it and take a stand on principle—except there is no principle. The President asked Senator Di Natale to withdraw multiple times, and he refused to do it. Somehow, he's now trying to blame the rest of the Senate for his own conduct. He's aided and abetted by those, most notably Senator Hanson-Young, who only seek to play every identity card of politics to protect themselves from criticism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Hanson-Young cries in this chamber because she's upset about how someone's treated her, apparently that means she's off limits to criticism. When Senator Hanson-Young says terrible things about other people in this chamber and you call her to account for it, apparently it's being sexist. Senator Hanson-Young wrote in a book that somehow I'd sidled up to her and whispered in her ear. That's a dangerous fantasy in itself. I've never sidled up to Senator Hanson-Young and never whispered anything in her ear. This is from the same person who believed that <span style="font-style:italic;">Sea Patrol</span> was an actual documentary about Australia's border protection. This is the same person who repeated the egregious mistake about Captain Cook and about Australia Day and its significance for Australia—on two occasions. This is a person who has had to enter into repayment systems with the Australian government, which she's failed to fulfil until drawn out through publicity, and she's meant to be above criticism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are reducing ourselves to little compartmentalised identities, and that's not what we're meant to be about. Sure, we can be identified by our politics, by our world view, but each and every one of us is open to criticism. It doesn't matter whether you're gay, straight, male or female or indeterminate; you're a senator in the Australian Senate. We will be held to account for our words, we will be held to account for our actions—and we should be able to be held to account for our actions and our words. It's not bullying. It's not misogyny. It's not misandry. It's holding people up for examination. It is testing their participation in the democratic process, and no-one should be protected from that. No-one should be protected from it. Yet, shamefully, those who commit the most regular abuses of the standing orders, those who have very little respect for the customs or conventions that bind this place together, the ones that have diminished this place more than any others over the last decade or so that I've been here, are the ones that pretend they are now the victims. It is appalling and galling hypocrisy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want this place to function as it should, which is as a battle of ideas, you cannot hide behind the fact that you're wearing a suit or a skirt—or a burqa, for that matter. You should be held up to the same standards as everybody else. And, when someone wants to stand up, like Senator Hanson-Young did, and refer to ugly old white men or deny the existence of rampant sexism, misogyny, sexual abuse and allegations of rape within the Greens party, when they want to hide behind those things which we've talked about, and when Senator Hanson-Young wants to accuse ministers of being corrupt, unfit for office, on the take, a fool, whacky, a racist or a bigot, we're meant to put up with all of that. A crazy old white man—we're meant to put up with all of that. But, when you call Senator Hanson-Young someone whose ideas are completely out of touch and are based around fallacies, fictions and falsehoods, apparently you're a sexist. Well, I'm over it. I'm over the victim game being played in this place at any cost. I'm tired of it. The fact that we are all subject to the same processes and procedures means that we should all be subject to the same potential outcomes. If I say something wrong in this place—and Lord knows that I have on occasions—I've either stood by what I've said or I've retracted it. Very few of us are without sin in this place, but I will not take a lecture from Senator Di Natale or Senator Hanson-Young, who are the most egregious exponents of the things they've condemned this morning.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Last week I drove from my home in Ayr to the sittings of parliament in Canberra, some 3,104 kilometres away. I did that because I like to get out to western Queensland as often as I can to let people in small communities out there know that politicians do care and that we're prepared to get to their place of living in the way they do—driving the roads that they drive. I went to experience firsthand the devastating drought which is affecting many parts of south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales. I was also very keen to see what more the government could do to help in those drought areas. But another reason for my visit was to get firsthand evidence of what I have always known to be the case, and that is the additional cost of living that is imposed upon people who live in remote parts of Australia. Regrettably, this cost of living really creates two Australias. For people in the west—there aren't a lot of them; they're not a politically significant group—getting to a major footy match involves an airfare that could cost up to $1,500 return. Getting to see the grandkids could involve a long drive at expensive fuel prices. Getting to a specialist or even a doctor in many places involves a cost that people who live in the capital cities simply don't comprehend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a long time, I've been aware that these remote parts of Australia produce a great deal of the wealth of our nation—the wealth of our nation that's gained from mining and exploration, the cattle industry, the wool industry and the other industries that occur in remote Australia. I always use this figure: in northern Australia, with only five per cent of the population, we produce something like 55 per cent of Australia's export value. So people in these remote areas make a major contribution towards the wealth of our nation, but they're penalised for it because of the cost of living. An example of this is that in Bedourie a loaf of bread costs $6, and $2 of that is the cost of transporting the loaf of bread from Quilpie, where it's made, to Bedourie, a few hundred kilometres away. When I left Townsville last Tuesday, I filled my car with diesel and paid 158.9c a litre for diesel. When I got to Bedourie, to fill up the car again I had to pay $2.09 per litre for diesel. So you can understand the impact that has on people who live out in those areas, paying something like 50c a litre more for the diesel fuel that everyone has to use to get around in those parts. It is clearly unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 1945 the then government—I concede it was a Labor government—devised a program called the zone tax rebate scheme. If you read the speeches of the then Treasurer, you'll see that this zone tax rebate scheme was intended to try and compensate people in remote Australia for the remoteness, the cost of living in remote areas, and some of the difficulties of living in those remote parts of Australia. It was set at the time at 20 pounds and 40 pounds, in the then currency, for different zones, depending which zone you were in. Zone A involved some of the very, very remote parts of Australia. Zone B was for some of the less remote parts of Australia and included places like Townsville and Cairns, which now, of course, have every type of amenity, specialist, theatre and sporting event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, over the years the boundaries that were assisted by the zone tax rebate have needed change, and the amount of compensation to people has fallen behind because it's only been indexed on a couple of occasions. Had it been indexed since 1945, my rough calculation is that the special zone A rebate would have been something around $15,000 to $20,000, which would mean that some of the additional cost of living in those very remote parts would be compensated. In the lesser zones, the current allowance of about $300 would have been something like $5,000 to $6,000 and therefore a compensation for those costs of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a long time now, I and a lot of my colleagues from the coalition have been advocating a complete review of the zone tax rebate scheme and how it applies with fringe benefits as well, and also the remote area allowance given to those on welfare payments. I'm delighted to say that just 10 minutes ago the Treasurer, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, announced that the Productivity Commission will undertake a review into remote tax assistance to ensure it remains fair and contemporary. The review is in response to concerns raised that the remote tax assistance has failed to keep pace with a changing Australia. The zone tax offset, the fringe benefit tax remote area concessions and the remote area allowance provide financial support to people living in remote areas of Australia. The locations eligible for these forms of assistance are determined by geographic zones defined in the tax legislation, which have largely remained unchanged since they were established in 1935. Concerns have been raised that the remote area tax assistance has not fundamentally changed over a number of decades to reflect the changes in demography, infrastructure and cost of living. In response, the Treasurer has requested the Productivity Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the tax assistance and provide recommendations on an appropriate form and function into the future. The review is to commence early next year, and the commission is due to report to the government within 12 months. The commission will undertake broad public consultation, including meeting directly with remote communities and inviting public submissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, I congratulate the Treasurer for taking this step. I, and many others, have been asking treasurers for the last 30 years, in my case, to do this. These requests have been ignored, and so congratulations to Mr Frydenberg for at last taking up the challenge and getting a serious review by the Productivity Commission into the zone tax rebate scheme and the cost of living for those Australians who live in remote parts of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I urge all of those people—and many of them I spoke to last week on my drive from Ayr to Winton, Bedourie, Boulia, Windorah, Quilpie and Cunnamulla—who live in areas like Cape York, Western Australia, outside of Perth, the Northern Territory and remote parts of New South Wales and South Australia to look at the terms of reference and to make a submission to the Productivity Commission. It's important that we do make the Productivity Commission aware of the additional costs of living in remote parts of Australia and give examples of the cost of living and how that impacts upon the livelihoods of people in those remote parts, how it makes it difficult to get workers of any sort, skilled workers, into remote parts to run the mines, to run the schools, to run the police stations, to run the hospitals and to run the councils. The cost of living is prohibitive, and very few will leave the capital cities. This, if it is done properly, may change that and bring some fairness to our fellow Australians who do live in remote parts of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I rise to make a statement today about the appalling state of the National Broadband Network rollout in parts of my duty electorate of Dickson. This is an issue that I have raised in the Senate before: the mess that the NBN has become and the negative impact it's having on local residents and businesses, particularly small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me no pleasure to stand in this place and criticise the rollout of the NBN, because rolling it out across Australia was Labor's idea. We had a vision for the NBN—a vision of levelling the playing field between city and country when it comes to technical capabilities; a vision of new opportunities for communities, particularly in rural and remote areas, in health and education; and a vision of increased possibilities for new businesses and for people to have the flexibility and capability to work from home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the problem is this: under the Liberal-Nationals NBN rollout, people are going backwards in some areas. I constantly hear stories from residents who tell me that they were getting a better service under ADSL. And I hear from local businesses fed up with the NBN ping-pong, being passed from retail providers to the NBN and back again, with no-one taking responsibility and just fixing the problem. The problems caused because this chaotic, dysfunctional government wanted to save a buck are costing people time and money. Workers are taking time off work to wait for NBN installers who never come. Businesses are forced to turn customers away when their EFTPOS machines go down. And, in far too many places, like Samford in the electorate of Dickson, the internet is working too slowly to keep pace with the demands of our modern-day life. Staff in a regional hardware store told me this month that they get better internet service hotspotting on their phones than on their new NBN plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital divide, in my opinion, is getting worse and not better. Across the country, while some new estates are getting fibre to the curb, older homes—often in the same neighbourhood—have to settle for inferior fibre to the node and still have to rely heavily on the old copper connections to deliver their services. Only the wealthy can afford to run fibre all the way to the home, because, under the Liberal-Nationals plan, anyone who wants that superior service has to pay for it themselves. People are fed up. Labor is fed up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Samford &amp; Districts Progress &amp; Protection Association in Samford are also fed up. With my support and that of federal Labor candidate for Dickson, Ali France, they are now starting to take action. Residents in the Samford Skies estate first raised concerns about the new NBN technologies with the Samford &amp; Districts Progress &amp; Protection Association, Ali France and me earlier this year. At that time, I made representations to NBN Co on their behalf. The association then invited NBN Co to send a representative to give a presentation on the rollout to the community in July 2018, and I thank NBN Co for doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents were informed about a variety of the technologies being rolled out from February 2019 through to June 2020. A number of the residents currently using ADSL2 technology are going to receive satellite. This is in a community about 20 kilometres outside of Brisbane—but, in reality, just outside the outskirts of Brisbane. Residents on different sides of the street will be receiving different technologies. There are 1,230 premises to get fixed wireless, with the towers needed to develop this technology polarising the community and yet to be approved by council. It appears the community is split on this particular issue. Residents were very unhappy with NBN Co apparently unable to explain the reasons or the rationale for rolling out different technologies across the one community. The group tell me that they had no response from their federal member, the member for Dickson, which of course is Mr Dutton, to their complaints and pleas for assistance. This I find most galling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Dutton can find the time to copy Labor's policy on the Linkfield Road overpass—which, by the way, Labor has committed to funding—and is putting up billboards around his electorate and another one in the suburb of Ferny Grove. He can find the time to book the new billboards and to campaign on issues that Labor has committed to, but he can't seem to find time to respond to the local community group on an issue that his government has royally stuffed up. If there were anyone on the other side who might admit that the coalition's rollout is a shambles, you would think it might be Mr Dutton, given that it was his nemesis, Mr Turnbull, who oversaw it. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to say that the progress association has decided to stand up and fight to make sure that the whole community can receive satisfactory internet services. The group is in the process of starting a petition, one that I am very proud to sponsor, and I look forward to tabling it in this place next year. Throughout December and January the petition will be advertised in the local community newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The V</span><span style="font-style:italic;">illage</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Pump</span>, through local businesses and local school communities. Ali France and I met with the association president, Mr O'Sullivan, and Samford Skies estate resident Mr Ferguson last Wednesday to talk about the petition, which is quite informative. The draft of it talks about the need for delivering fair and equitable broadband services across Samford Valley districts; the fact that currently the fixed wireless and satellite that are being proposed will deliver unreliable and capacity-constrained fixed wireless and satellite to those currently using ADSL services, which is one of the key complaints from this part of the community; increase the digital divide of unfair and unequal access to broadband—which is something that the community themselves have identified; and reduce access to online educational facilities. It's quite clear that this community has worked out that NBN Co has failed the Samford Valley districts area in fostering productivity and providing a platform for innovation in order to deliver economic and social benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network. Last week we released a report which found that regional Australians have copped a raw deal under the coalition's NBN. I want to reiterate our finding that 'the decision to reduce Labor's fibre footprint in order to save a buck has oversubscribed the fixed-wireless network and resulted in poorer outcomes for residents'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I look forward to further considering the feedback from communities like Samford in my ongoing role on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network. Most of all, I look forward to the fight to secure a Labor government to implement some changes where NBN is concerned, changes designed to bring the NBN a bit closer to Labor's original vision.</span>

Certainly one would always wish, in a workplace and more broadly, that if, concerns need to be raised in relation to behaviours or other matters, then they can be raised in an appropriate way without fear or, frankly, favour. I would make that observation. Secondly, again, not having seen the statements to which Senator McCarthy has referred, I can say that as sentient adults, by and large, in this place, we all face the consequences of our actions.</span>

Nevertheless, let me tell you what the Prime Minister will be talking to Australians about when we go to the election. He'll be talking about the fact Australia's economy is growing at 3.4 per cent, more strongly than at any other time since 2012. He'll be talking about us meeting our promise of the creation of one million new jobs by businesses in this country, supported by government. He'll be talking about the fact more Australians are finding jobs and that the percentage of working-age Australians on welfare has fallen to 15.1 per cent—the lowest rate of welfare dependency in over 25 years. He'll be talking about the fact that we're making income taxes lower, fairer and simpler—</span>

I listened to her intently. She has not stopped shouting at the Minister for Defence. I usually try to stop her, but I have taken notice of what you've said, Mr President, so I intend to call a point of order every time Senator Wong breaches standing orders and interjects continuously on ministers that they've asked questions of.</span>

Indeed, in the five years we've been in government, we have been able to increase the level of investment in most of the essential services that Australians expect without the need to make decisions to increase the tax burden on the economy. Our expenditure on hospitals went from about $16 billion in 2012-13 to about $23 billion in 2018. That is an increase of about 42 per cent. Indeed, over the period of the current forward estimates, it will go up about 63 per cent all up. Schools went from $14 billion to $20 billion. Child care went from $4.6 billion to $8 billion and will increase by more than 100 per cent in the period to 2021-22. Indeed, for the NDIS, there was no expenditure on the NDIS in 2013. Today we are spending $17 billion, and that is projected to increase to about $24 billion by 2021-22—and all of that without having to make decisions to increase the overall tax burden in the economy. In fact, we got rid of Labor's mining tax, we got rid of Labor's carbon tax and we reduced taxes for small and medium-sized businesses across the economy. We have delivered income tax relief to the tune of about $144 billion for hardworking families right across Australia while increasing government investment in the important services that Australians rely on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How have we done it? Our lower-taxing agenda helped to deliver stronger economic growth, with more Australians employed, more Australians paying personal income tax and fewer Australians claiming as much in welfare, because they've got a job. That is how you put the budget on a strong and sustainable foundation for the future. That is how you pay for the important services in hospitals, schools, child care, NDIS, aged care—you name it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our approach is to build a stronger economy with a stronger budget to ensure that we can afford to pay for the essential government services that Australians rely on over the medium to long term. Labor, on the other hand, when last in government lost complete control of the budget. When Labor lost government the economy was weakening, unemployment was rising and the budget position was rapidly deteriorating, to the point where they couldn't even pay for the listing of new medicines on the PBS.</span>

Labor, on the other hand, lost complete control of the budget. And do you know what happened? This is our message to the Australian people, and it will be our message to the Australian people every single day between now and the next election, in May next year: whenever Labor run out of money here in Canberra, they'll come after your money, with $200 billion in higher taxes, which will hurt the economy and which will lead to lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment and less revenue for government. The message to the Australian people is that under Labor you will earn less and you will pay more, and the government will be in a mess again.</span>

Our approach to energy policy is to ensure we deliver reliable energy and lower electricity prices, and, of course, Labor's approach is to whack Australian families with higher electricity prices on the back of the return of the carbon tax and also on the back of a completely irresponsible and unsustainable 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target. What has happened since the National Energy Guarantee was first proposed and, incidentally, opposed by Bill Shorten—or, if he supported it, he was very much in hiding—is that we had an ACCC report that made a whole series of very sensible recommendations which the government has adopted. They are all a matter of public record. I'm quite happy to send all of the paperwork to Senator Pratt. If the Labor Party wants to engage with us, support our plan for lower electricity prices and walk away from their carbon tax—which would harm the economy, put jobs at risk and also harm the opportunity for Australian families to get ahead—I'm all ears.</span>

There are four key parts of our plan. The first is a price safety net to stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers who don't have time to shop around for a better deal. We know that some households are paying over $800 more per year and some small businesses nearly $3,500 more per year. We'll also be stopping price gouging and dodgy practices by the big energy companies, including banning sneaky late payment penalties and making energy retailers pass on savings in wholesale prices to customers. We'll be backing investment in reliable power by underwriting new electricity generation to improve competition, increase supply and reduce wholesale electricity prices. We'll be supporting 24/7 reliable power by requiring energy companies to sign contracts guaranteeing enough energy to meet demand. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:19</span>):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Cash. Minister, I note that your government's finally caved to public pressure and has brought a number of children and their families from Nauru to Australia. Can you confirm that either all or the overwhelming majority of those children who've been brought to Australia along with their families are currently being held in detention in Australia's onshore immigration detention network? How many children from Nauru do you currently have locked up in Australia?</span>

Senator McKim sits there and yawns, colleagues, because he doesn't understand the reality of the policies that they have agreed with—policies that saw in excess of 50,000 people come to this country illegally. Senator McKim, the fundamental difference between those of us on the Liberal-Nationals side of politics and those on the left-wing side of politics is that we don't even want to see children go into detention in the first place, which means that we have tough border protection policies, because, Senator McKim, under the former Howard government—</span>

But, Senator McKim, as I was stating, in excess of 8,000 IMA children were detained whilst you supported the policies of the former Labor government. As at 28 November, 45 children were in detention.

On this side of the chamber, the Morrison government, we know that a fundamental role of government is to ensure that our nation, the nation of Australia, has a strong economy. As the Leader of the Government has said: why do we need a strong economy? Well, without a strong economy, you cannot deliver record funding for education. You cannot deliver record funding for health. And you certainly would not be able to guarantee the essential services upon which Australians rely.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we will always put in place policies that will ensure that Australia has a strong economy. Of course, those policies will back small and family business every step of the way. Under the coalition government, under the Liberal-National government, we have seen the creation of almost 1.2 million jobs since we were elected to office. How do you create jobs? You put in place the policies that ensure that businesses are able to prosper and grow and, of course, have a strong economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been able to deliver, because of the strong economy, tax cuts for 10 million Australians. You cannot give tax cuts if you don't have the economic fundamentals right. We've been able to give tax cuts to not only up to 10 million Australians but also the 3.3 million small and family businesses in Australia, because we know that, when Australians have more money in their back pockets and when small and family businesses have more money in their back pockets, they'll invest in themselves and they'll spend more money. In doing that, businesses are able to prosper and grow and create more jobs. The Liberal-National government understands small and family businesses. They are the backbone of the Australian economy, and our policies ensure they prosper and grow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Whilst we were in Launceston, we met with a number of small and family businesses. In fact Tasmania is home to more than 7,000 small businesses, and, as Senator Bushby knows, our government is committed to putting in place policies that will help them prosper and grow. We met with a gentleman by the name of Lindsay Bourke. Lindsay Bourke owns Australian Honey Products. They have some of the best honey in the world, often known as manuka honey. Lindsay has actually taken advantage of the free trade agreements that we signed as a government. Having been able to take advantage of these free trade agreements, Lindsay now exports Tasmanian-made honey all over the world. That's what backing small and family businesses is all about—ensuring they have opportunities to prosper and grow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's why Senator Birmingham is out there every day looking for further opportunities for small and family businesses in Australia—to ensure their products are able to get into the channels that will take them overseas. And, of course, a fundamental difference, as we move towards the next federal election, is: do you want to pay higher taxes? If the answer to that is yes, vote Labor. If you want to have a government that will do everything it can to lower your taxes, whether it's personal income tax or the tax you pay as a business, vote Liberal-National. There's a fundamental difference. Higher taxes: vote Labor. If you want a government that backs you and backs lower taxes, vote for the Morrison government.</span>

Can you confirm the department's view that siting of such a facility within the Woomera Test Range would present what is claimed to be an intolerable risk for range operations?

As I understand the nature of the FOI, the material that has been released relates to the analysis that was done of Commonwealth landholdings which indicated that there was no Commonwealth land suitable for hosting the facility. But a number of the parcels included in that analysis were Defence land, as the senator has noted. This response has come from the department and relates to that analysis.</span>

Noting that, can you tell the people of Hawker and Kimba why there is nowhere within 122,000 square kilometres of the prohibited area where you can place a facility?</span>

Australia is a small business nation and our economy is strong, with growth rates that the OECD nations are jealous of, thanks to the hardworking small and family businesses right across our country. The Liberal-National government has a strong track record of backing small businesses, increasing jobs and building stronger regional economies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just our fishers, our foresters and our farmers operating small and family businesses out in regional Australia; regional tourism is making a significant contribution to the economy, in excess of $51 billion—and it is booming in your home state of Tasmania, Senator. In fact, Robert Knight, who runs the Bruny Island Long Weekend, has been expanding and developing his business and ensuring that he in turn supports other local businesses by procuring some fresh local Tassie produce. We're backing small businesses like the Bruny Island Long Weekend all the way by cutting the small business tax rate, changing competition law to level the playing field, extending the instant asset write-off, simplifying the BAS and cutting payment times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that cashflow is key to small business and crucial to the day-to-day operations. Small businesses shouldn't be used as a bank by government or indeed by big business. That's why we've taken action to reduce those payment times, and now we're asking for big business to follow our lead. We are working with 3,000 of Australia's largest businesses with over $100 million turnover to develop a reporting framework to make sure that, when they buy from a small business, they pay in a timely manner. We've also created the $2 billion Australian Business Securitisation Fund, to enable greater access to finance for small family businesses on competitive terms when they need it. Small-business owners shouldn't have to put the family home on the line in order to gain access to finance. More than three million small businesses, including our agriculture, fishing, forestry and regional tour operators, are critical for a stronger economy.</span>

Local economies will grow and regional jobs will be created because we want more cash to stay in the pockets of small family-owned businesses. That's more money these families can invest back into their business, keeping the cash flow local and being spent in our regional economies. We're investing $60 million in a wage subsidy trial to support employers in rural and regional communities to engage more apprentices in trades like plumbing, mechanical and electrical trades. We're doing more to support female entrepreneurs because when women do well their families do well, and our economy and nation prosper. We want small businesses to thrive, so we're cutting down the hours of paperwork and regulation by simplifying BAS. They can now submit online because we've done the heavy lifting with regional connectivity. We're creating the settings and practical initiatives to enable small regional businesses to grow and prosper.</span>

Labor is no friend of regional small businesses. Labor see the small business sector as a threat to their union membership mates. They do not understand the importance or realities of small family-run businesses out in regional Australia. Instead of backing agriculture and our farmers, you want to shut down our live sheep exporters. Instead of backing our primary industries to export to the world, you want to damage our trade relationships. Instead of backing regional small businesses, you want to actually make it harder for them to employ locals. You stand for higher taxes and higher energy prices, and want to make it more onerous for small businesses to grow and prosper out across regional Australia. You constantly fail to back businesses. You fail to back the people you claim to represent—the labourers and tradies out in regional communities. It's small businesses that create jobs, not the unions or the Labor Party.</span>

The New Zealand government recently endorsed a Ministry of Health cabinet paper that proposed support for smokers to switch to significantly less harmful alternative products. This support involves improving smokers' access to quality vaping and smokeless tobacco products, and improving publicly available information on vaping. The cabinet paper emphasises access to vaping in particular for Maori smokers because a greater proportion of the Maori population smoke compared to the non-Maori population. Are there lessons for Australia in New Zealand's desire for Maori smokers to switch to significantly less harmful alternative products like vaping? Given the very high rates of smoking by Indigenous Australians, why would this not be relevant to Australia?</span>

The government currently takes an evidence based approach to the subject of e-cigarettes and vaping devices in efforts to reduce harm from tobacco. We acknowledge there are a range of studies internationally which appear to demonstrate the safety of vaporised nicotine products. But, equally, there's no conclusive evidence that can say with any certainty that these products are safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death, premature death and disability in Australia, and this government remains committed to doing everything we can to reducing smoking levels. Sadly, Indigenous smoking rates, unsurprisingly, are parallel with socioeconomic opportunity rates and they remain unacceptably high at around 45 per cent compared with only some 12 per cent in the general population. As the senator indicated, that is very similar to the New Zealand example. Tobacco is the only risk factor shared by all main categories of non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has committed to reducing the rates of smoking in Indigenous communities. In February this year, Minister Ken Wyatt announced $183.7 million to continue the Tackling Indigenous Smoking program. The Tackling Indigenous Smoking program is a key part of the implementation of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. I'm pleased to report that the reduction-of-smoking goals contained in this plan are all on track to be met.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tackling Indigenous Smoking program complements work already being done by the national Don't Make Smokes Your Story campaign. But, importantly, with New Zealand now moving to regulate e-cigarettes, we will have a live example of how this works in a very similar population across the ditch, which we'll be watching with great interest. I'm very confident that the lessons from the New Zealand experience will be heeded here in Australia.</span>

The legal use of nicotine for use in e-cigarettes would require an amendment to the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons—that's the Poisons Standard—which is a record of decisions regarding the classification of medicines and chemicals into schedules for inclusion in the relevant legislation of the states and territories. There's a clearly defined process for amending the Poisons Standard to be considered. It's important to note that this is independent from government.</span>

I've got a lot of time for Ms Westacott, who does a great job as the CEO of the Business Council of Australia. One of the missions that Jennifer Westacott has pursued in recent years is a lower and globally more competitive tax rate for businesses in Australia. So I assume, now that Senator Marshall is a fan of the BCA and is promoting the arguments put forward by the BCA, that Senator Marshall is now going to advocate for a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate.</span>

We know that Labor governments around Australia in the past, most famously the Labor government in South Australia, have failed to keep the lights on in their state jurisdictions. We know that Labor governments in the past, having promised, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' have then turned around to push up electricity prices in a way that hurt the economy, put jobs at risk and hurt the opportunity for families around Australia to get ahead. Under our government, you will get a continuation of stronger growth, more jobs, a stronger and improving budget position, lower electricity prices and more reliable energy supplies. That will be the choice before the Australian people at the next election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:54</span>):  I thank Senator Gichuhi for her question and her deep interest in the success of Australian exporters, who, of course, come from all walks of life, all backgrounds. Last night nearly 100 exporters gathered here in Canberra to celebrate the 56th Australian Export Awards. These were 100 amazing examples of Australian ingenuity, the drive, the innovation and of course the risk-taking that come from those who decide to look beyond our shores and to sell high-quality Australian goods, services and products into markets overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was particularly pleasing to see last night is that 35 per cent of those participants at the national export awards were small businesses—businesses employing fewer than 20 people but who were out there selling their products on the world stage. They'd come through the export awards at a state or territory level to represent their state or territory and then gone on to be here at a national level. That's a credit to the fact that Australian business is willing to have a go. They're increasingly willing to have a go thanks to the work of our government in making it easier for Australian businesses to export and to access international markets. A significant number, 45 per cent of the participants in the export awards, are exporting into markets like Japan, Korea and China—markets in which our government has delivered free trade agreements over recent years, ensuring exporters can get improved, enhanced access into those markets. That is an example of where we have managed to expand the scope for business. Five years ago, Australian business only had duty-free or preferential access into 26 per cent of markets where goods and services trade occurred. Today that stands at nearly 70 per cent—a huge increase in terms of the markets our businesses can access, and that's why trade has contributed an estimated one-quarter of Australia's economic growth over these last five years. </span>

This is outstanding news. South Australian businesses were recognised in the category of Australian Exporter of the Year and received the Regional Exporter Award and the e-Commerce Award. South Australian exporter SEAPA jointly won the Exporter of the Year Award with ACT business Aspen Medical. SEAPA specialises in innovative injection-moulded plastic oyster baskets, enabling oyster farmers to grow higher quality oysters at lower cost. They began exporting to North America but today also export into Europe and Asia, a great example of Australian ingenuity, driving export businesses overseas. Torbreck Vintners won the Regional Exporter Award. I expect Senator Wong would look up there—I suspect she enjoys Torbreck's drops. They are great Barossa Valley red wines. It is a fine South Australian business, exporting now to 42 countries across the world. Adelaide business SWEAT, winner of the e-Commerce Award, is the world's largest— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Exporters are a core part of the strong economy that Australia has that is stronger thanks to the work of our government that allows us to be able to fund all of those investments whilst ensuring that we bring the budget back to balance as well. Export businesses also, on average, hire 23 per cent more staff than non-exporting businesses, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity that is 13 per cent higher. We can see real benefits from those businesses who look outwards. But those opportunities are under threat, because, whilst our government has done such a great job expanding market access, we see from the Labor Party promises to go out and renegotiate Australia's trade agreements, a threat of uncertainty that will hamper investment and risk those many benefits that come to Australia— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For over 12 months, the government has resisted Labor's calls for the establishment of a national integrity commission. On Monday, the Prime Minister declared the establishment of a national integrity commission a fringe issue. Does the Prime Minister stand by that statement?</span>

Of course, in Australia, traditionally, under governments of both political persuasions, we have had a multi-agency framework in place to ensure that corruption is appropriately detected and dealt with. Now, we've always said, consistently, that we're always open to suggestions and ideas on how these current arrangements can be further improved.</span>

We know that Mr Shorten announced a headline about a year ago saying that that was based on 12 months of consultation, but we haven't actually seen a single draft bill. We haven't seen any detail to deal with some of the complex issues that have to be dealt with in this context. We know, of course, the legislation that has been put forward by the crossbench, and, to their credit, at least they have gone to the effort of putting forward a bill, but there are a whole range of issues, complexities and problems with that, so we are currently considering the best way forward.</span>

Just making change for the sake of change is not the right way forward. I might also just say that Australia, under governments of both political persuasions, internationally has a very good track record when it comes to the fighting and the prevention of corruption. Australia has got a very good track record, by international standards, and we will continue to ensure that whatever reforms are pursued make the current arrangements better and more effective rather than cause a whole range of undesirable problems.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals and Minister for Regional Services, Sport, Local Government and Decentralisation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I would like to update Senator Hinch with some answers to questions I took on notice. My advice from the Deputy Prime Minister is the port of Portland is Victoria's third largest grain port by tonnage and the world's largest exporter of woodchip. The line carries 500,000 tonnes of freight each year and provides direct connection to the port of Portland. However, the success of this line depends on the condition of the network that supports it. That's why the Australian government is taking a long-term approach to rail investment in the region by investing over $240 million to upgrade, standardise and reopen the lines across the Murray Basin. This investment is an important first step to ensure freight can be moved efficiently across the north-west of Victoria before being transported to Portland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Projects in the region need to be well sequenced to maximise industry and employment benefits and reduce network disruption and construction costs. Our immediate priority is to complete upgrades in the Murray Basin. This work is underway and is expected to be completed by 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government will continue to review freight demand in the region and discuss with stakeholders the potential merit of upgrading the line to Portland. The Australian government is aware of interest in upgrading the line from Portland to Maroona, but the upgrade of the line to Portland was not included in the scope of the Murray basin freight rail upgrade as developed by the Victorian government. The rail line is currently leased to the ARTC, who operate it on a commercial basis, and they've advised that, while the upgrade has merits, they are unable to fund it on a commercial basis, as the capital and maintenance costs will outweigh the expected revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any decision to upgrade the line to Portland will need to be made with the support of the Victorian government. In the meantime, the government is prioritising the Murray basin freight rail upgrade as the most important project to be brought to completion. Doing so will ensure the appropriate sequencing of rail projects across the region and maximise the benefits to industry, and this will also give additional time for the ARTC to consider the commercial viability of the upgrade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commence my remarks by acknowledging that Senator Payne is one of the few women on the front bench of the Liberal Party. Despite the fact that she's a childhood friend of my husband, I am very disappointed in the minister's answer today. The question that she was asked, which really was a test of her capacity in the role that she holds in this place representing the Minister for Defence, was a question which went to the matter as put:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister should have been prepared for that very important question. She represents the Minister for Defence in this place. She should have been prepared—prepared to stand up for the women in her party, prepared for a question about the great shame of what's happening to women in the Liberal Party and the people whom they should be representing here in the government. The great shame is that she was not prepared, and her answer was:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a joke! 'I'm not aware of those statements,' she said. How could she not be aware that the member for Chisholm walked away from the Liberal Party yesterday and took a spot on the crossbench because, as a woman, she says it's intolerable to remain within the Liberal Party?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are a divided, dysfunctional government. Whatever they're doing when they show up for work here, there's no way you could characterise it as governing. In fact, for women in the Liberal Party—who found a small, quiet voice for a day in the words of Julia Banks yesterday—they are doing anything other than governing. They're not interested in looking after the Australian people. They've broken promises left, right and centre. They're more interested in their preselection games. They are a model of disunity. You can have the division between the Right and the Left or the pro-Morrison group and the anti-Morrison group. Pick a team. Or there is the pro-Dutton group and the anti-Dutton group, the pro-Turnbull group and the anti-Turnbull group, or the pro-Abbott group and the anti-Abbott group. But do you know what the biggest group they've got is? It is 'every man for himself, and let's leave the women behind', and that's what they're doing to create a culture of fear and intimidation that was so well articulated by Ms Banks yesterday.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The gift of time and reflection has provided some clarity regarding the brutal blow against the leadership. Led by members of the reactionary right wing, the coup was aided by many MPs trading their vote for a leadership change in exchange for their individual promotion, preselection endorsements or silence. Their actions were undeniably for themselves—for their position in the party, their power, their personal ambition—not for the Australian people who we represent; not for what people voted for in the 2016 election; not for stability, and disregarding that teamwork and unity deliver success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt, said? He was reported in an article by Katharine Murphy in which she describes what he said. This is what he said about a woman he calls his friend—so God help us for what he says about people he doesn't like, like the rest of us! This is what he said, and it was described as 'caustic':</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He said she would have to "take the opprobrium"—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">that's the word he used—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you've got enough time, Google the word 'opprobrium' and see what it means—the shame, the vilification, the attacks. That is what the Minister for Defence of the nation of Australia said about a woman in his own party: 'She should get ready to take the vilification.' That is why Julia Banks took a spot on the crossbench—because this Liberal Party, which seeks to govern the nation, cannot govern itself and certainly is not supporting women. In fact, it's doing the exact opposite. It's ditching them and it's pushing them under water, as they all scramble for their own success at the cost of the country. There's one picture I want to celebrate today: the picture by Alex Ellinghausen, which shows— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  She did. She said there are so few. To my left and right, we have absolutely outstanding contributors on our front bench, male and female. Some of those outstanding female contributors include, of course, Minister Payne, who the question was directed to, and Minister Cash, who cops nothing but abuse from Senator Cameron and others every time she gets up. He has a history of abusing her. The Labor Party never does or says anything about that. The Labor Party tolerates that kind of abuse. It also comes from Senator McKim, from the Greens. We heard it again today—the constant abuse of and yelling at the outstanding Minister Cash, Minister Ruston, Minister McKenzie and Minister Reynolds.</span>

They are doing an outstanding job and they often do it despite the abuse that is hurled at them by members of the Labor Senate team and by members of the Greens Senate team. We don't hear leaders within the Labor Party or the Greens doing anything about that. We've seen some of the disgraceful behaviour, particularly from Senator Cameron, in that regard.</span>

Senator Pratt smiles, but we don't smile at some of the disgraceful behaviour that has been conducted in the name of senior CFMEU officials—for example, Luke Collier, who was defended so strongly, with many questions asked on his behalf by Labor senators, such as Doug Cameron. But the Labor Party takes money from that disgraceful organisation, despite their abuse of women, despite their aggressive behaviour towards women, despite the violence that has occurred to women by some of the senior officials, including those who have been convicted for that behaviour.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Neill also claims that we're not getting on with the job and delivering. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. We need only look at the Australian economy, with a 3.5 per cent growth rate and with the over one million jobs that have been created under this Liberal-National government's watch. We have created the conditions so that business, small and large, in this country can get on and employ more people, become more profitable and invest more in their businesses. More than a million more Australians today have the opportunity for work than they did when Labor left office, and they left us a failing economy and a failing budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're bringing the budget back to surplus, despite the opposition of the Labor Party and the Greens, and we're doing it whilst delivering record investments—not just in health, not just in education, not just in infrastructure but also, of course, in the important defence of our nation. That mob over there not only threw open the borders when it came to border protection but also ran down the defence budget in the most reckless way to the lowest level of spending since the Second World War. That was under the Labor Party. We've restored it. We've increased it year on year with a defence construction program, with defence infrastructure, with a defence build that will set this nation up. We're doing it, delivering for the economy and getting people into work. Under this government we have the lowest proportion of Australians of working age on welfare in a generation. We are very, very proud of that record. It stands in contrast to the Labor Party's record. If they were to come back we know that their $200 billion tax hit, their hit on the family home with everyone's values going down and their hit on renters through the negative gearing policy would destroy our economy. That's what we'll be arguing for right up until the election next year, whenever that is held.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  As debate in the nation's parliament and around the country has shown, this government has not a woman problem but a man problem. In rising to take note of the answers to the questions asked by Senator McCarthy, I note that the kind of chaos that besets this government is very, very clear. As Julia Banks characterised it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My sensible, centrist values, belief in economic responsibility and focus on always putting the people first and acting in the nation's interest have not changed. The Liberal Party has changed, largely due to the actions of the reactionary and regressive right wing, who talk about and to themselves rather than listening to the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at those people in the coalition and in the government, it shouldn't surprise anyone to see that, at the core of those debates, perhaps with the exception of Senator Fierravanti-Wells, are the reactionary right in the men of the Liberal Party. You are creating chaos in your own government and across the nation. The problems you beset this nation with are vast, deep and important to the nation's wellbeing. The question I asked in the Senate this afternoon was about the National Energy Guarantee and about policy. But, because of the climate change deniers among you, you are unable, as a party, to land simple policy propositions in the national interest. You've changed your minds, I don't know how many times, in trying to come up with a climate change and energy policy. Why? Because your internal processes and your leadership are absolute chaos. Why is that the case? You sacked one prime minister in Malcolm Turnbull, who had to sack Tony Abbott before that, and now we've got Scott Morrison. Why? Because you cannot put together a coherent and substantial agenda for this nation in the national interest. You have no coherence as a government or as a party anymore. As Senator McCarthy's questions to Senator Payne rightly went to, when will Mr Morrison do this nation a favour, do his MPs a favour—as one coalition MP purportedly put it to Patricia Karvelas—and put you out of your misery and have an election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this nation needs is a plan to fix our schools and hospitals, to ease pressure on household budgets, to stand up for workers, to invest in cheaper, cleaner energy and to build a strong economy that works for all. Yet, on all of these questions, all those opposite can do is to send us into a quagmire of inattention to the real needs of the Australian people. This government is so self-absorbed and so out of touch that it cannot land a real punch on any major policy initiative that this nation needs in terms of leadership and governance. Take a look at what's happening in our nation's schools. You haven't delivered fair funding to the public school sector in Australia. You have absolutely failed, in your inaction on climate change policy and energy policy in this nation, to do anything that is easing pressure on household budgets. You've been in government for five years, and still you've changed your policy minds some five times on this question. So, senators—through you, Madam Deputy President—we have a government that is divided, out of touch and only working on behalf of very narrow vested interests, including those inside its own party, as Julia Banks's remarks to the lower house yesterday made clear. We cannot stand for any more of this chaos—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I too would like to make a contribution to the take-note debate on the question asked by Senator McCarthy of Senator Payne. I don't quite know where to start today; it's an unusual one to be taking note of. I will perhaps go to the middle of Senator Pratt's contribution, where she talked about the very important issues of health, education, a strong economy and creating jobs—the things I know Senator Payne did refer to in answer to the question asked. It is important for those listening to the debate, those who are here today, to understand exactly what was asked—questions, again, about internal party politics, reports in papers and unsourced comments by MPs—something one coalition MP apparently said. Senator Pratt pointed to, rightly, a number of things that are important to Australian voters—things like funding our hospitals appropriately through our state governments and ensuring schools are appropriately resourced to educate our children so they can read and write. Something I've made mention of in this place many times before is that the functional literacy rate of adults in Tasmania is woefully low. It's these things that are important—not the things that we are taking note of today, not the question that we are spending half an hour of the Senate's time reflecting on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A million jobs have been created across the country. That seems to have been lost in the consideration of what we spend our time in the Senate talking about, what the opposition focuses on during its time to interrogate the government about its policies and plans. Instead, we spend our time talking about this. Here we are, on Wednesday, and we have spent most of this week considering these internal political issues—things that matter to the press gallery but not to the people of Wragg Street, Somerset, or Mount Street, Burnie, or Collins Street, Hobart—all those people who actually depend on us governing in their interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we focus on what actually matters to Australians, not insider politics to fill the front pages of our daily papers and fill air time on Sky News, as fun as that might be. We've got to get outside the Canberra bubble. That's why I liked when Senator Payne, in answer to the question asked by Senator McCarthy, outlined some of the great achievements of this government. The rate of growth this economy has experienced under this government is something we don't hear questions about during question time; we talk about unnamed MPs providing quotes to papers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax reforms that we've seen will benefit millions of small to medium businesses. Even though we are not taking note of it, my question was about that. The tax reforms, as Senator Payne referred to, will create thousands of jobs in regional Australia, where they're needed. These are important issues—ensuring Australians can pay the bills they are confronted with every month, making sure they can support their children as they grow up and are ready to leave home, and making sure families are financially capable of looking after themselves into the future. When I go out doorknocking, when I spend time at street stalls or country shows, people aren't asking me about this sort of stuff. They're asking us to just get on with the job and to do the right thing by them. And that means for us to actually focus on these things here in this place, in the Australian Senate—to get on with policy matters that actually matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is disappointing that we've seen debate degenerate to this level. I take issue with the opening line of Senator Pratt's contribution to this debate on taking note of answers, suggesting, 'It's not a women problem; it's a man problem.' I, as a father of three young boys, want to set an example for them about how to conduct themselves. We have values in our household. I have my own values as a Christian. I want to impart to them the right way to grow up, the right way to conduct themselves with women, with men, with old people, with young people—with people of all sorts of different views and philosophies on life. To characterise all the things Senator Pratt talked about as relating to gender—that it's a 'man problem'—I find offensive. I want us, in this place, to focus on things that actually matter to Australians, that matter to my children, when they take the reins as adults in the next generation, not the issues being asked about. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite who've contributed in this last half hour have missed the point completely. The rate of growth of the economy, jobs, tax reform for millions of Australians—everyone wants to see a better life for all Australians. But, if the behaviour that is reflected in this Senate and in the House of Representatives were reflected out there in the broader Australian community, it would be totally unacceptable. The most senior person in the previous Prime Minister's cabinet said exactly that, yet today my question to the foreign affairs minister couldn't be answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we uphold the highest values in the way women in particular are treated in the parliament. Our contribution matters, and we should be able to make it without fear of retribution, without fear of being humiliated, without fear of thinking differently to others. I would like to believe that that is at the core of the values of our country in respecting each other. It is important that we debate all sorts of issues, but we must have fundamental ground rules about the way we relate to each other. We've seen the member for Chisholm drawing her line in the sand and resigning from the Liberal Party because of the way women are treated. The member for Chisholm said in her speech yesterday that, when good women call out or are subjected to bad behaviour, the reprisals and commentary portray them as being bad. It certainly didn't take long for her former colleagues to do exactly that. It didn't take long for them to reinforce the message that the coalition government is hostile to women, calling points of order today instead of addressing the question, and choosing to hide behind questions of procedure rather than address questions about why women in the coalition government are concerned and constrained by fears of reprisal and retribution if they speak out. Bullying and intimidation—it is behaviour out of step with our country. It is behaviour that should not be tolerated here in the parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's ironic that the timing of the former Liberal, now Independent, member for Chisholm's resignation came on the same day that the new Labor government in Victoria unveiled a 50 per cent female cabinet. In my home in the Northern Territory, women make up the majority in cabinet. Labor is not a political boys club. We are certainly a better party and we reject bullying of any kind. As Senator Wong said today, we will not tolerate sexist and abusive behaviour. We will not tolerate it in the Senate and we will not tolerate it anywhere. The Senate itself will not be respected if the behaviours exhibited in here demean it. That goes not only to rules but also to standards and expectations. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKim today relating to asylum seekers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to take note of Senator Cash's responses, and I use the word 'responses' advisedly, because it was very, very difficult to categorise Minister Cash's responses as answers to my questions. I want to make these points. Over the last few months we've seen an incredible groundswell from people right across this country in defence of the children who've been locked up for years in offshore processing on Nauru. The Australian people, over the last few months, have stood up and demanded an end to the cruelty and demanded that those children and their families be brought to Australia and given freedom and safety. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cruelty of offshore detention is underpinned by an assumption that that's what the Australian people want. That's an assumption that is made time and time again by the Labor and Liberal parties. It's an assumption that assumes the very worst in people. That assumption is wrong. Australians do not want this cruelty. We are better than that. The knowledge that we are better than that is why the government have fought so hard to keep journalists out of Nauru and why they fought so hard to keep politicians, including me, out of Nauru. They have tried to keep their cruelty hidden so that the Australian people won't revolt in horror at what is being done in their name. But the Australian people have fought back, and it is yielding results. Their pressure has meant that dozens of children have been brought to Australia for medical treatment. However, Minister Cash today confirmed that many of these children are being locked up in onshore detention, here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom and safety mean exactly that. No child should be in detention. Whatever the question, the answer is never locking up innocent children and it is never deliberately harming kids. These kids have been so brutalised by the policies of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party that they cannot hope to properly heal while they are locked up. They cannot hope to properly heal when they're not out in our community. They cannot hope to properly heal while they don't have proper access to the supports that they need, including the education support that they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These kids and their families need to be given permanent protection in the Australian community. Every other man, every other woman, every other child that Australia has locked up on Manus Island and Nauru deserves freedom and safety, and I've got no doubt that the pressure from the Australian people will continue until those demands are met, because the Australian people are showing that we are better than the erroneous assumptions made about our values by the Labor and Liberal parties.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today you asked the Procedure Committee to consider developing an order requiring that motions to suspend standing orders moved during formal business time be put without debate. The committee has considered the matter and recommends the adoption of a temporary order to have effect immediately until the last sitting day of this parliament. The proposed order provides that the question be put immediately, without amendment or debate, on (a) any motion to suspend standing orders to provide for the consideration of a motion for which formality has been denied and (b) any other motion to suspend standing orders moved during the consideration of formal business under standing order 66.

The size of the operation can be gauged from the fact that, when found out, some $2m worth of meat certified in this way was still held in cold-storage. The operator had paid a registered AFIC slaughterman to provide false certificates at a rate of 20c per carton certified. It had paid him more than $38,000 in the space of just over ten months. The slaughterman presented his false certificates to the state Islamic Council office which issued final certificates without question. The matter came to light only by chance when an employee at the state Islamic Council tried to ring the man at work only to be told he did not work there."</span>

                  </a>  In the wake of the global financial crisis, lower economic activity had an impact on emissions—not a carbon tax, which shifted emissions and jobs overseas. The repeal by this government of the carbon tax resulted in residential electricity bills dropping by up to 10 per cent and cost-of-living savings to households of $550. The government does not support a carbon tax or a carbon price. A carbon price would drive up electricity prices, lead to job losses and impact on our economy.</span>

The government has the right mix of policies to address climate change and keep our economy strong. Both emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the economy were at their lowest levels in 28 years in the year to March 2018.</span>

                  </a>  Labor notes the hypocrisy of this motion coming from the Greens. When Labor attempted to legislate an economy-wide carbon price in 2009, it was the Greens who sided with the Tony Abbott-led opposition, who voted it down in an act of vandalism that has gone down in the annals of climate change infamy. Labor took comprehensive climate change policy to the last election and we will do so again next year, and no amount of grandstanding by the Greens will cause the Australian people to forget that, when push comes to shove, the Greens choose political opportunism over practical climate action every time.</span>

                  </a>  It seems that we have that contribution from Senator Chisholm referring back to the 2010 decision to institute a carbon price as political opportunism—political opportunism in 2010 when we worked with the Labor Party, when we worked with the progressive Independents and we got what the International Energy Agency described as model legislation for combating climate change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Chisholm, why is it that you won't defend what was then and remains now a piece of legislation that, if adopted by this parliament, would put us on track to tackling dangerous climate damage? Why is it that you walk away from that legislation? Why is it that you don't defend it? Why is it that you go back to 2009 rather than stand up and defend what we did together in 2010? You should be proud of that achievement. We are. We worked together. We got action done, and you seem to be ashamed of it. You should be ashamed of yourself for not having the courage to stand up for what was a great piece of legislation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Labor does not support this motion. We are the only party with a consistent, comprehensive and credible policy to take serious action on climate change. Labor's policy is focused on creating a clean energy economy as well as taking an active and constructive approach to international efforts to cut carbon pollution. Our policies are based on meeting a 45 per cent whole-of-economy emissions reduction target and achieving zero net emissions by 2050, in line with the Climate Change Authority's advice on Australia's fair-share contribution to keep warming below two degrees and in line with UN and International Energy Agency advice on what is needed to meet Paris accords. In regard to the mine approval, Labor stated yesterday that we believe that the early advice from the independent expert scientific committee needs to be updated to consider impacts on groundwater and water systems as well as the cumulative water-related impact of the proposal in the context of past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions. Labor is committed to action on climate change and environmental protection.</span>

                  </a>  This motion is nothing more than a cheap political stunt. Labor should be embarrassed for relying on the fabricated evidence of the disgraced former Australian Border Force commissioner. They should be embarrassed for pursuing a Senate inquiry which only proved that the Minister for Home Affairs acted within his ministerial power. These base political games cannot change the fact that the Liberal-National government has ended Labor's chaos at the border. The government has stopped the boats, ended the deaths at sea, got all the children out of detention and kicked thousands of non-citizen criminals, including murderers, child sex offenders and outlaw motorcycle gang members out of our country.</span>

                  </a>  We oppose this motion because it is based on a false statement about the role of the ACT in this action. It's terrific that young people want to get active on the issues that matter to them. Young people want to see the government take serious action on climate change. We share their strong feelings. We don't want to see students missing out on schoolwork. There are plenty of opportunities for young people to campaign for climate action outside of school time, including school holidays and weekends, and we would be the first to support them. Labor set targets to improve Australian schoolchildren's performance, and these targets were scrapped by the government—of which Senator Bernardi was a member at the time—as being red tape. Australian schoolkids should get the best education in the world, and Labor's investments in schools will make this happen.</span>

                  </a>  Our Liberal-National government is putting veterans and their families first by investing more than $11 billion each year in support. We've invested more than $275 million in the most significant reform of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in a century. Rifle Company Butterworth's service is recognised in the context of the legislation and policies that applied at the time of the service. The service of Australian Defence Force members who served at Butterworth during the period 1970 to 1989 has been and will always be valued by Defence and the Australian government. This service is recognised by the awards of the Australian Service Medal 1945-75 with Clasp SE Asia or the Australian Service Medal with Clasp SE Asia, depending on the period of service. As such I ask that the question on part (a) of the motion be put separately from the question on parts (b), (c), (d) and (e).</span>

                  </a>  Labor understands that this matter has been reviewed a number of times, including: the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards in 1993; the Review of Service Entitlement Anomalies in Respect of South-East Asian Service in 1999; the Review of Veterans' Entitlements in 2003; the inquiry into recognition for members of Rifle Company Butterworth for service in Malaysia between 1970 and 1989, which was conducted in 2011; and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Final report by the Medallic Recognition Joint Working Group on service in South-East Asia 1950 to 2011</span>, sponsored by the New Zealand government, in 2013. In addition, this was reviewed in 2014 by the Department of Defence in response to a petition seeking a review to enable reclassification of service by Rifle Company Butterworth from 1970 to 1989. As illustrated, this matter has been reviewed a number of times, including several of an independent nature. These reviews, several in the context of medal recognition, have concluded that service at Butterworth during this period is not considered warlike.</span>

                  </a>  Lady Cilento was an incredible woman, a pioneer in the fields of women's and children's health. She was a household name in Queensland due to her decades of tireless work across a variety of different fields. The decision made by the then Queensland Liberal and Nationals government to honour Lady Cilento by naming the children's hospital after her was the right one. The politically motivated decision by the Queensland Labor government to remove Lady Cilento's name from this hospital is shameful, and their decision to use a rigged, gerrymandered survey to justify this name change is embarrassing. Nearly 18,000 votes, or half the votes in the entire survey, came from the same 74 IP addresses, including some of the same IP addresses as used in Queensland ministerial offices. A total of 6,000 votes from just four computers is alleged. The Queensland state government should be condemned for their sneaky tactics, their attempt to dishonour an incredible woman and their misuse of taxpayer funds. I urge senators to support this motion.</span>

                  </a>  This is another attempt by the government to hide from their own record on health funding. The coalition government is cutting $6.9 million from the Queensland Children's Hospital between 2017 and 2020 alone. This is part of a massive $160 million cut to Queensland hospitals over the same period. The LNP in opposition in Queensland has drummed up a fake scandal about the children's hospital name, because they have no health policies of their own. They are too weak to call out their mates here in Canberra over their hospital funding cuts. The Queensland government changed the name of the hospital to Queensland Children's Hospital following requests from doctors and staff at the hospital and taking into account a range of considerations. The medical staff association had been campaigning to change the name of the hospital ever since the Newman government named the facility, in late 2013, without any public consultation whatsoever. A petition with almost 1,000 staff signatures calling for the facility's name to change was given to the Queensland health minister recently. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I wish to express my strong support for this motion. Lady Cilento was a truly great Australian and a pioneer in women's and children's health. Perhaps more than anyone else, she richly deserves to have a children's hospital named after her. Queensland Labor's efforts to erase the name of this wonderful Queensland lady from the hospital, especially by using fake surveys and deregistering the name in advance of any purported consultation process, is an absolute scandal. Labor are only too keen to rush to name public assets in honour of has-been Labor Party hacks, like the Clem Jones Tunnel, but take exception to having the name of a real achiever and a great contributor to the lives of so many Queenslanders. The real reason Labor wants to erase the name of Lady Cilento from the children's hospital is precisely because she wasn't one of their hard-left cronies. Lady Cilento was a high-achieving woman who held traditional Christian values. For comrade Palaszczuk and her socialist sisterhood— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Labor acknowledges the work Tony Seabrook undertakes on behalf of the agriculture sector. However, Labor cannot support the motion due to the continuing controversy the AgDay award continues to deliver. Last year the inaugural AgDay award was given to Barnaby Joyce with a $40,000 cheque and an event co-sponsored by the National Farmers' Federation and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources at an event held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. This year the award was held in Sydney on a boat cruise in Sydney Harbour at $175 a head. Unlike last year's event, this year's event was not supported by the National Farmers' Federation or the agriculture department and there was no $40,000 cheque. The government is constantly telling the parliament and the Australian people that the government is standing up for those people in agriculture and that we should be engaging with those in the region, yet it's happy to support the AgDay award events in capital cities, rather than provide much-needed economic benefit to those in our regions.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens will not be supporting this motion. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia may well have represented the interests of agricultural producers, but this is not necessarily taking action in the interests of the broader community and our environment and animal welfare. Much of what they have done is not something to be congratulated. In particular, the motion noting that the PGA of WA successes include advocating for property rights is code for advocating for removing clearing controls which are protecting native vegetation in Western Australia. The motion also notes that the PGA of WA successes include defending the live export trade. The motion notes that what they do is not always popular. I note that today, in my inbox, I have received 20 emails passionate about stopping the live export trade because of animal cruelty and awful animal suffering. This is not something to be congratulated and not something that the Greens are supportive of.</span>

I think it's a very sad state of affairs and it does show where those on this side of the chamber stand in relation to agricultural industries.</span>

                  </a>  The Commonwealth government is proud that Australia's firearm laws are among the strongest in the world. While we recognise that many Australians have legitimate reasons for owning legally registered firearms, community safety remains our paramount concern in firearms policy. In addition to the tough firearms laws, the government is committed to removing illegal firearms from our community and tackling gun-related crime, such as through the 2017 national firearms amnesty. The 2017 amnesty resulted in the surrender by the community of more than 57,000 illegal firearms, including 2½ thousand fully automatic and semiautomatic firearms. The government consults with the states and territories as well as the community and industry groups. We welcome feedback on all aspects of the National Firearms Agreement and broader firearms issues.</span>

                  </a>  The gun lobby's attempts to replicate NRA tactics in Australia are reprehensible and must be rejected. The NRA is a blight on American democracy. The Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia, SIFA, is bankrolled by the gun industry heavyweights, such as Beretta. The gun lobby is becoming increasingly active in election campaigns, with a clear strategy to weaken our gun laws. SIFA contributed $220,000 to a political campaign in Queensland last year and at least $165,000 to a political campaign in Victoria this year. This shouldn't just alarm us; it should terrify us all. We have to make sure that our gun laws are never watered down.</span>

We stand with over one million law-abiding firearms owners across Australia who have purchased their legally obtained firearms from a local law-abiding business. These businesses go through thorough processes to ensure that our nation's gun laws are adhered to. It is because of law-abiding store owners, shooters and industry that we've had such a small amount of breaches over two decades.</span>

But you've got to remember that this means not supporting shooters, hunters, farmers and our elite medal-winning athletes who own a firearm. Further restricting law-abiding businesses, individuals and industry will not reduce the amount of gun related crime or the use of illicit firearms by criminals. We must continue to work on ensuring that law-abiding sporting shooters, hunters and farmers are respected and are able to continue to enjoy legally partaking in their activities and sport.</span>

                  </a>  Once again the Greens have shown that they have NFI about the NFA. In fact, they have no idea about firearms, the firearms industry or gun control in general. They pretend the National Firearms Agreement is a binding contract the states must follow or else. It isn't; it is a guide the states can adapt to their own circumstances. This motion is essentially calling on the federal government to bully the states into implementing a non-binding document that's over 20 years old and has many unintended consequences that punish a million law-abiding shooters. Also, for the record, it's 'Beretta', not 'Baretta'.</span>

                  </a>  The National Firearms Agreement was a travesty—simply a left-wing plot to undermine the constitutional rights of the states to independently legislate their own gun laws. Like the $400 million registered buyback after Port Arthur, the NFA has been of zero value in reducing firearm related crime, because terrorists and criminals do not buy registered guns. Restrictions on licensed firearm ownership by law-abiding citizens do not target those who own and misuse firearms illegally. So this motion, like the policy to which it refers, makes no sense. You might as well try to crack down on unlicensed, dangerous drivers by increasing the difficulty of the driving test.</span>

                  </a>  I brought this motion to the Senate today because of concern amongst my constituents for the Saharawi people. This motion largely restates the UN's position on Western Sahara and Australia's endorsement of it. As a DFAT official explained at estimates earlier this year, we support UN efforts to find an enduring settlement for the people of Western Sahara. During our time on the UN Security Council Australia participated in regular consultations on the issue. We commend the ongoing efforts of the UN mission and the Secretary-General's personal envoy, who is attempting to resolve the issue. I hope resolution is achieved. The people of the Western Sahara deserve it.</span>

                  </a>  In line with the government's longstanding view, motions that cannot be debated or amended should not deal with complex foreign policy matters. The mandates of the United Nations peacekeeping missions are matters for the UN General Assembly and Security Council to consider in the correct forum and in the context of the resolutions passed by member states. Australia is a longstanding and strong supporter of the United Nations and other bodies such as the Human Rights Council. Successive Australian governments have used these forums to properly consider and decide the UN approach to issues of human rights, peace and peacekeeping and conflict resolution.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government is deeply concerned about the re-emergence of the preventable disease silicosis. Safe Work Australia has prioritised action to address the risks posed by dust exposure in the workplace, including in the engineered stone industry. The agency is developing strategies to raise awareness of the duties and control measures for minimising respirable silica dust in the workplace. This includes reviewing the workplace exposure standard for respirable crystalline silica, research into behavioural and cultural motivations to manage dust exposure in small and medium-sized enterprises in the stone industry, and developing a targeted awareness campaign for respirable dust in the workplace. Council Of Australian Governments health ministers have committed to requesting that the clinical principal committee consider creation of a national dust related diseases register including silicosis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance debate today. This is a very timely debate on energy policy. Although we already knew it, the United Nations has today confirmed that Australia will not meet our Paris emissions reductions commitments under the current Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government energy policy paralysis. We won't meet the commitments that this very government signed up to just a few years ago, and yet what is this government's response? From Prime Minister Morrison down through his ministers, we hear that Australia will meet our commitments in a canter—a statement that is misleading and downright dangerous. Of course we didn't need the UN to tell us this galling fact; the government's own data shows that, under Mr Scott Morrison's hopeless climate change policies, carbon pollution will continue to rise all the way to 2030, which is as far as the projections go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're finally beginning to admit the ridiculousness of their statement that, under their policies, we will meet our commitments in a canter. As Senator Fawcett told a Senate estimates hearing:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the reduction we had over the 2016-17 year, if we continued that and that was our current settings then we would do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that reduction is not a real reduction but a reduction relative to the forecast emissions. The government's own data shows that, in each year since they came to power, emissions have increased, and perhaps worst of all is reliance on the current settings. What are the current settings? Policy paralysis, no certainty for the renewable energy industry and an arrogant government that doesn't seem to care about our future energy needs. They don't care about reliability, they don't care about price and they don't care about emissions. All they care about is playing politics to see coal as their electoral saviour. It is an obsession akin to the Greens in reverse. Instead of sensible, pragmatic policies to transition Australia's energy sector to focus on what is the most cost-effective, cleanest energy, all they want to do is talk about the government building a coal-fired power plant as though it will solve all our energy policy problems. But they have no desire to work through a bipartisan agreement on energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's position is clear. In fact, despite the roller-coaster of positions adopted by the government, our position has always been clear. We are willing to work with the government to deliver a bipartisan energy policy. On no fewer than six occasions today in question time, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Cormann, was asked about the government's shambolic approach to energy policy. What is their current policy? What was it? What is it? They could work with Labor to find a path forward on the very policy, the National Energy Guarantee, the NEG, they proposed just months ago. Would this Morrison government—with the architect of the NEG policy, Minister Frydenberg, as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party—work with Labor to deliver the very policy they proposed just months ago? What was Minister Cormann's response? No commitments to work together, no acknowledgement of the complete shambles the Liberals and Nationals have left the energy sector in over the past five years, and no vision for how to break their self-imposed impasse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear only one party is serious about taking up the challenge of energy policy, and that's the Labor Party. Last week, Labor leader Bill Shorten and energy spokesperson Mark Butler announced our plan for more renewable energy and cheaper power. What we're proposing is not a short-term political fix—that seems to be the obsession of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government—but a comprehensive 10-year energy investment framework that will deliver certainty for industry, lower power prices, improve reliability in the grid and drive investment in the renewable energy generation that will address climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How are we going to do that? First, we'll double the original investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation from $10 billion to $20 billion. Then we'll provide $5 billion to futureproof our energy network through the Energy Security and Modernisation Fund, and we'll implement a new $31 million energy productivity agenda that will seek to turn around Australia's flailing energy efficiency performance, which has seen us fall to last out of developed countries in energy efficiency policy and performance on the Liberals' and Nationals' watch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the CEFC and ARENA are achieving fantastic things across our energy generation and distribution sectors, as well as working with organisations and business to improve energy efficiency. But, to keep doing this work, more finance is needed. In contrast to the ATM government, who wanted to shut the CEFC down, we see its great work and want to boost its impact across the country. We want to boost investment in large-scale generation and storage projects including solar and wind farms, boost the use of solar and battery systems for homes across the country, and boost investment in energy efficiency projects, commercial and community renewable energy projects, and industrial transformation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, the CEFC's major investment is in the Granville Harbour wind farm on Tasmania's magnificent west coast. I've been a passionate supporter of the Granville Harbour wind farm since its inception by a farmer and his mate, Royce Smith and Alex Simpson. The CEFC is investing $59 million for the $280 million project. Once completed, the wind farm will produce up to 112 megawatts of renewable energy, generating enough electricity to power more than 46,000 homes. That's enough energy to power most of the homes in the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, improving our generation capacity and creating much-needed construction and maintenance jobs. It's happening right now on the north-west coast and on the west coast of Tasmania. I'm excited by this project—and by other wind farm proposals on the table in Tasmania, including at Cattle Hill and Robbins Island—and I'm excited that it is being assisted by the CEFC, a body that Labor created back when I first started in this place in 2011; a body which, with only around $5 billion in investments, has leveraged a massive $19 billion of investments in clean energy projects so far; and a body with the personnel, the mandate and, with Labor's support, the resources to drive further investment. Such further investment will hopefully include Tasmania's Battery of the Nation project. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Battery of the Nation is a phenomenal proposal that could see a number of projects built that cumulatively would deliver an additional 3.5 gigawatts in storage and up to 3.5 gigawatts in transmission interconnection, unlocking 6.5 gigawatts of wind generation. It uses Tasmania's natural hydropower assets and our amazing wind resource to deliver pumped hydro to boost Tasmania's contribution to the National Electricity Market. It will boost reliability and decrease emissions. While ARENA is currently co-financing the feasibility study with Hydro Tasmania, the power of the CEFC is that it could provide a large amount of finance for the delivery of the project and crowd in any private investment that may be needed to get it over the line. But the Battery of the Nation isn't feasible without a national energy policy. It needs strong leadership from government to see the project over the current hurdles and into construction. It needs a national energy policy that supports greater investment in renewable energy. It needs governments in Canberra and Hobart that will drive the case for a second Bass Strait interconnector, not the current sop from Liberal energy ministers Taylor and Barnett—and not the stunts we saw today from the Greens that are more focused on reigniting division than on delivering improved outcomes for households and the environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has put a strong plan for more renewable energy and cheaper power on the table. It picks up some strong policy work by the government in the reliability space and builds on the clear gap in their policies around emissions reductions. Labor's plan will help deliver 50 per cent of power from renewables by 2030. It will keep power prices lower, it will improve reliability in the electricity grid, and it will create tens of thousands of jobs in the renewable industry. It's time for the other parties in this place to embrace our plan and end the senseless division that we are continually seeing on energy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  The Labor Party seek to have 50 per cent renewable energy. They seek to reduce Australia's carbon emissions. But I might just start on this point, because I see a number of children in the gallery. I just want to mention to the Senate, as I have mentioned before, that Australia produces less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. That is a fact. You won't hear it from the Greens political party because they never tell the truth in things like this. So I asked the Chief Scientist: 'If Australia stopped its emissions by 1.2 per cent—that is, if we stopped every car operating in Australia, if we turned off every light in Australia, if we shut down every factory in Australia, if we turned off the lights in every school in Australia and reduced our emissions by 1.2 per cent—what difference would that make to the changing climate of the world?' And the Chief Scientist said, 'Virtually nothing.' So this focus of the Labor Party and the Greens on reducing carbon emissions to, so they say, save the Great Barrier Reef is a complete falsity, a complete farce. The Chief Scientist acknowledges that nothing Australia does will have any impact on the changing climate of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, when every other country reduces their emissions and gets them down to 1.2 per cent like Australia, Australia should do that too. Australia is a good citizen of the world. We attend conferences. We agree that everyone will try and reduce their emissions. And Australia has a target to reduce emissions, signed up to in Paris. You might have heard about the Paris Agreement. We agreed that we would reduce our carbon emissions by 26½ per cent by 2030. And do you know what? We're one of the few countries in the world that is going to meet its targets and meet them well. Why do I know that? Because we've almost met them now, a couple of years ahead of the target date. We've done that by encouraging people to do the right thing. We're not going to legislate for a 50 or 80 per cent renewable energy target, because all that does is put the price of electricity up. It makes everything that happens in your home more expensive—because you need electricity for your refrigerator, for your lights, for your TV, and for your heater if you happen to be in the southern parts of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened is that the electricity companies have been ripping off the consumers. And one of the biggest rip-off electricity producers is the Queensland Labor government. I looked at the list today to see how many Queensland Labor senators were appearing in this debate, because I wondered how they would explain the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. The Queensland Labor government has just approved a licence for new coal-fired power stations and new coalmines in Queensland. I congratulate them for that. Coal is plentiful, it's cheap and it brings Australia huge amounts of income from our exports. And the way they build coal-fired power stations these days, there is very little emission of carbon. So the Queensland government's done that. The Labor Party people in the Queensland government acknowledge that coal's good. In fact, royalties from coal keep the Queensland government budget afloat. Yet when you come down to Canberra the same Labor Party wants to ban coal. They don't want any coal at all. They're promising to shut down the coalmines in the years ahead of us. Never mind about all the workers who would lose their jobs if that happened. Never mind about states like Queensland, who only exist because of the royalties from coal. They don't worry about that. They're only interested in trying to gain some political advantage in the leafy suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, where they can tell whatever mistruths they like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that, before the Batman by-election, Mr Shorten, the Labor leader, went to Batman and said, 'We're totally opposed to Adani.' A few weeks later he was up in Townsville, where I live, where Adani has its headquarters. He was telling everyone there, 'Adani's a great company, and we welcome their investment in coal in Queensland.' So, you cannot believe anything the Labor Party says. In fact, the most common saying in Australia these days is simply this: Labor lies. And you'll find that time and time again. Unfortunately, there are no Labor senators listed on the speaking list today—and I can well understand why, because how could they explain the hypocrisy of Queensland Labor supporting coal while federal Labor, of which they're a part, are not supporting it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the biggest rip-off in Queensland is the state government owned—that is, the Labor state government owned—energy supplier. They run all the distribution of energy, particularly in North Queensland, where I live. They make huge profits each year—Ergon, the Queensland state government's business entity. And what do they do with those profits? They pay them to the Queensland government as dividends. Now, if you wanted to reduce electricity prices in my state of Queensland, you would simply get the Queensland state Labor government to tell their energy supplier, Ergon Energy, to reduce their prices. That way, those of us in Queensland would pay less for our electricity. It would mean, of course, that the Queensland government wouldn't get as much of the profits to try to balance their budget. So, you see, Labor is completely in shambles over energy policy. I heard the previous speaker asking why we weren't supporting the NEG, the new energy policy that the government was talking about some months ago. In those days, Labor was totally opposed to it. Today, suddenly, they think it's a great idea, and they want to introduce it. How hypocritical of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've promised as a government that we will get prices down. It's already started to work. We've reined in the power of the networks, which has secured better deals for about 1.6 million households. The retail prices in Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales will come down because of the activities of the federal Liberal-National Party government. Our pressure on the energy companies has already lowered power prices for AGL customers on standing offers, and AGL will protect customers on standing offers by implementing a price safety net. Victorian and New South Wales AGL customers will benefit from a 10 per cent discount on their usage charges. That's because the Liberal-Nationals federal government has put pressure on those big companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've long said in this government that the lower power prices would happen. We've made that happen, and I expect that more will happen from the big energy companies. They've had it too good for too long, and this government is pressuring them into reducing their prices. We have an energy plan that's been put into place—it's actually working as we speak—as opposed to Labor's plan, which is all over the place, and it depends on whether you believe in what Queensland Labor are proposing or in federal Labor. Nobody quite knows what the Labor Party is going to do. All we know is that you'll pay more for your power under Labor, that you can't trust Mr Shorten to keep the lights on, as the last Labor government in South Australia showed, and that it's quite clear that Labor is on the side of the big energy companies, because it owns the one in Queensland. You can't trust Labor to take a big stick to the energy companies to stop those rip-offs. That's why the coalition government's energy plan is workable and is working. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I rise to speak on the MPI. It looks like a Greens motion! We welcome that, and we welcome the strong language on renewables. As we've said, we want to work constructively with Labor on energy policy in the future. But this motion is just words. What does 'ending the power privatisation mess' mean in the real world? The Greens have, in our policy platform, a public energy retailer. We would see the states building and owning these crucial network interconnectors. What is Labor's policy to end this so-called privatisation mess? Everything's already been sold off, and much of it was under your administration. The difficulty of staying below 1½ degrees, which the science tells us we've only got 12 years to do, requires more than just words, and it requires a policy that does more than just subsidise renewables. We support that, but it's not enough on its own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Energy Market Operator—AEMO, as it's known—has said that business as usual would get us to 46 per cent renewables by 2030. Labor's policy is for 50 per cent by that same year. That's only a four per cent difference—an extra one gigawatt of new renewables over and above what would happen anyway in the next 10 years. That isn't transformative. It's not enough. Building just one gigawatt in a decade is not a solution to the climate breakdown. In South Australia, there's one chap building one gigawatt of solar already, and yet this is Labor's plan for the whole country over a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transformation is bringing the carbon price back. It's linking it to the EU market immediately. It's picking up where we left off with the world-leading climate laws and carrying on as though Tony Abbott never happened. In addition to strong support for renewables, an economy-wide carbon price is what we need to push out coal, to encourage farmers to sequester carbon and give them an additional income stream, to tax the fugitive emissions from gas and coal mining and to change the investment decisions of Australian industry. The Labor Party are sadly so traumatised by a scare campaign on carbon pricing that they can't even support a motion Senator Di Natale moved today that simply stated the facts about how successful that carbon price was and the benefits that carbon pricing brought to the economy. And, tragically, neither side of the chamber supported my motions yesterday and today about ruling out a new water-hungry, climate-destroying thermal coalmine in Queensland's Galilee Basin, right next to the Adani mega-mine, which both sides of politics support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is affecting us now. This is not something to worry about for future generations. It is happening now. Queensland is on fire. There are more than 138 fires burning in my state right now. The fire commissioner has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We have never ever in this state been in this situation before. We've not had a catastrophic level before.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Premier has said this has never been seen before. This is exactly what climate change is going to continue to do to weather events. More than 30 schools have been closed, which is kind of ironic. The Prime Minister yesterday was condemning kids for wanting to participate in the school walkout on Friday to beg governments to take action on climate change, and now these kids in Queensland don't have the chance to go to school because of climate-induced bushfires. I hope the Prime Minister can see that irony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that support for climate action is stronger in the community than it's been since 2008. The community want us to do something. They can see that we've lost half the reef's coral cover. They can see that people are suffering from the sorts of climate-induced weather events that are currently wreaking havoc in Queensland and, I might add, in Sydney, with the massive downpours. But all Labor are doing is salvaging the policy that the Liberals threw in the bin. The NEG was a policy that was designed to get through a Tony Abbott government. It would further entrench the market power of the big three energy companies and simply add to the so-called privatisation mess, which this motion apparently opposes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I beg both sides of the chamber: please stop approving new coalmines. The science could not be clearer. Our planetary system cannot handle new coal being added to the system. We welcome the strong support for renewables by the Labor Party. It's not as strong as we think the science would tell us it should be and it's not as strong as the Greens will push for—that's exactly why you need us in this chamber—but we welcome your strong steps. But please stop backing new coal. The reef can't handle it and our communities can't handle the extreme weather events. My heart goes out to Queenslanders and the fantastic emergency service personnel coping with what will become the new normal. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  Climate change and energy have been in the media again this week after reports that this issue was raised by disgruntled voters on polling day in Victoria on Saturday. I'm always glad to see climate change being discussed, but I think it does a disservice to the issue to speak about it just as an electoral question. The government doesn't need to address climate change because of what happened in Brighton or Hawthorn or, indeed, Wentworth. The government needs to address climate change because of what is happening to the Great Barrier Reef, what is happening to our bushfire season and, indeed, what the science tells us is happening all around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need to act is real, and the government is failing to meet it. There is no plan at all to address climate change. What is their policy on climate and energy? Minister Cormann was asked about it repeatedly in question time today and it was very clear that there is no answer. There's a jumbled set of recommendations that draw on a really important report by the ACCC, but it goes nowhere near being a comprehensive energy policy. It goes nowhere near creating the kind of long-term certainty that industry tells us again and again and again that they require if they are going to invest. That's what's needed right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be very clear about the problem in the energy sector. It is an investment strike. Investors in that sector are saying that, until there is clarity and until there is certainty about energy policy, they will not be in a position to make the necessary investments. All the while, our existing capital stock is running down. It's past its used-by date. It is going to need to be replaced, and that's going to need private sector investment. But no-one will invest while the government is all over the shop about the energy policy that they propose. Part of it is a failure to be able to deal with emissions reduction. Nothing about the energy policy that they've got at the moment—weak as it is—deals in any way with climate change. It's confirmed explicitly by no less than the energy minister. Mr Taylor, in the other place, has stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Emissions reductions are the least of our problems …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tell that to the people of Kiribati. Tell that to the people who risk having their livelihoods eroded by damage to the Great Barrier Reef. Tell that to the people who work in the alpine area during the ski season as each year we see a decreasing likelihood we'll get the kind of snow cover necessary to sustain a skiing area. Tell that to people whose houses will be threatened by bushfire. Tell that to people who are at risk of very serious illness or death owing to the increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves. Tell them that emissions reductions are the least of our problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emissions reduction ought to be at the forefront of our thinking, but this government cannot come to terms with it. They are bereft of policy ideas. The environment minister, Melissa Price, has indicated that the government may revive the Direct Action policy, a relic of the Abbott period. We're five years in and back to what was always a cobbled-together policy. Direct Action is expensive and ineffective. It is a form of corporate welfare. Research confirms that many of the projects funded through the Direct Action program are projects that would have gone ahead anyway. Landfill operators have been awarded subsidies in each of the auctions. Their projects, often, were already generating revenue from electricity sales and already generating revenue from renewable energy certificates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Advice from the Wilderness Society is that land clearing undertaken in states where the LNP have wiped out land clearing protections has basically taken out all of the value obtained by the $1.5 billion in taxpayer funded emissions gains. That's according to the government's own figures. So public money that was spent cutting greenhouse gas emissions by planting trees and restoring habitat under the coalition's own Direct Action policy will effectively have been negated by little more than two years of forest clearing elsewhere in the country. It is a hopeless joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund has contracts to present 124 million tonnes of emissions through vegetation projects, but, in the same period, forest clearing has released more than 160 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since the fund began in 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very sad thing is that there has been no lack of options for this government. But, like a fussy toddler, they've just taken everything that's been given to them, chewed it up and spat it out. We understand, more than anyone in this chamber, the need for bipartisanship. We've offered bipartisanship, because we think that's what the country deserves and what industry deserves. We offered it for the emissions intensity scheme, but that was vetoed by then Prime Minister Abbott. We offered it for the clean energy target developed by Dr Finkel, and that was also vetoed by Prime Minister Abbott. We offered it for the National Energy Guarantee, the next iteration of their policy mess, but that was first abandoned by Prime Minister Turnbull and then ignored by Prime Minister Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does this government keep proposing energy policies and strategies and then abandoning them? It is because they are fundamentally divided. They cannot work out what they stand for on energy policy. They cannot come to any internal settlement about how they ought to approach this question, because half their party room doesn't even believe climate change is real. Many of them are in this chamber, and I'm certain their contributions this afternoon will reflect that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is wrong. We do need action on emissions. Climate change has, in one way or another, cost the Liberal Party two Prime Ministers, but the Liberal Party's inaction on climate change has really cost Australians. Australia's emissions in this last year, once you exclude unreliable data on land use in forestry, were the highest on record, and it's the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions. At this rate, we will not meet our Paris commitments. No amount of wishfully saying, 'We've met them in the past and that in itself is sufficient guarantee that we'll meet them in the future,' will cut it. You actually need a policy. Prices are going up. Industry tell us that it is the uncertainty in the market that is driving up prices, and they are demanding action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back when the Finkel review came out, the Business Council chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia hasn't a moment to lose now that we have a comprehensive, independent blueprint to restore the security, reliability and affordability of our electricity system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of Energy Australia and a board member of the Reserve Bank, Catherine Tanna, has said, 'The solution to high prices is a national plan to transition the future of energy into renewables.' How has the government responded to this? With nothing—nothing about the future emissions intensity of our energy system. They have the big stick of divestment, which they talked about endlessly, but that is a policy that is almost entirely bereft of support or friends. How far from the pack have the coalition government drifted if the BCA is criticising them on their policy because it provides insufficient certainty to industry? The BCA have described the government's current energy plan as 'ad hoc' and 'extreme' and, like Ms Bishop, they have urged the government to adopt the NEG.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a plan to reduce emissions. I say this to the Greens political party: it doesn't matter if a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice. The real thing that matters when it comes to the environment and when it comes to climate is your target. I will tell you what our target is. It is zero net emissions by 2050 and 50 per cent renewables by 2030. We know that investment in technology will be necessary to meet that. That's why we've announced support for batteries and that's why we're saying that we will double the investment for the CEFC. Research and analysts are telling us that the best policies not only have an impact on emissions; they will drive prices down. That's the basis of the Labor policy. That's the policy we've put together, because we know renewables are the cheapest form of new generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we need new generation capacity, and we know that we cannot afford to muck around any longer. We have had five years of inaction. Consumers are suffering, the environment is suffering and, frankly, confidence in our national political process is suffering. We take climate change seriously. We take energy policy seriously on this side of the chamber. That is not a question of electoral maths; that is a question of science and a question of engineering.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  Labor's audacity and lack of self-awareness in opting to choose energy for the topic of today's policy discussion would be laughable but for energy's criticality to the wellbeing of our fellow Australians. Labor's energy policy is not about helping pensioners, helping low-income families, helping small business and helping our farmers to balance their budgets and pay their bills. Labor's energy policy is not about helping the young or the environment. Labor's energy policy is about appeasing its extreme Left, who worship at the Paris altar of impractical, counterproductive and job-destroying green ideology. Make no mistake: the Labor Party, led by Mr Bill Shorten, will deliver the Australian people an energy bill that will leave them short. In Labor's desperation to develop an energy policy, they crept into the Liberal Party room, rummaged through the Liberals' rubbish bin and are now hailing as their policy bits of our discarded policy. They claim that somehow that is innovative and worthy of support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the Labor Party's commitment to recycling, because that is practical environmentalism, but can I say: recycling is not so good when it comes to policy. The policy was discarded for a reason: the cost to our fellow Australians—to our pensioners, low-income earners, small businesses and farmers. The Liberal policy in this space is clear: we commit ourselves to being good, very good, environmental stewards. And being good environmental stewards does not mean wrecking people's lives with carbon taxes and higher energy bills and breaking household budgets. Our policy puts price before Paris—an agreement which is now disavowed by or not impacting India, China and the United States, making up a very large proportion of the world's CO2 emissions. So, with a bit over one per cent of the world's emissions, through which we provide the hungry populations of the world with cheap and quality cereals, dairy and meat products, we have nothing of which to be ashamed and everything for which to be thankful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was experienced under Labor, Labor's high energy bills saw jobs and production flee to our near neighbours, who were using our coal to ensure that they had cheap energy prices. So, under Labor, we were reducing our emissions whilst others were increasing their emissions with our coal so they could manufacture things that used to be manufactured in Australia and have the privilege of then exporting them back into Australia—not good environmental policy for the world, not good social policy and not good economic policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On being elected, the Liberals abolished the carbon tax and restored economic confidence. Make no mistake: you can have all sorts of people talking about a lack of confidence in our economy, but there is one very good, independent indicator of economic confidence, and that is jobs growth. And have we delivered on that front—over one million jobs in less than five years. Tens of thousands of our fellow Australians are now benefiting from being fully engaged with the economy, which enables them to regain the dignity of self-reliance and the capacity to contribute to themselves, their family and their nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's latest attempt to increase our energy bills and leave us short is to pursue a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target—a target which will swing the wrecking ball through household budgets and the Australian economy. If you want to quote the Business Council of Australia, that is exactly what they have said about the Australian Labor Party policy, something that was missing from the previous speaker's commentary. As a nation, to date, we have sunk literally tens of billions of dollars into renewable energy whilst our energy bills have in fact gone sky high. This is Labor economics at its destructive worst. Talk about welfare for business: the renewable energy sector has been the greatest beneficiary of taxpayer subsidies and funding over years which have delivered higher energy costs to the detriment of our households, our pensioners, our small businesses, our farmers and, of course, our major manufacturers. Using taxpayers' money to subsidise an inefficient and unreliable energy supply so we can all then pay higher energy prices to boot, on top of those tax subsidies, is neither good economic sense nor, indeed, common sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that isn't enough, Labor, not having learned from their pink batts debacle, now want a new pink battery debacle by offering a $2,000 taxpayer subsidy to those willing to buy a toxic battery. It's something the Greens and Labor never talk about: what happens when these batteries meet the end of their life cycle; what are we going to do with them? But, that aside, these batteries will be provided for people with solar panels on their roof—or, one assumes, also, potentially, for people with windmills. So just think about this: a battery that will cost, very conservatively, at least $8,000 to $10,000, under Labor will receive a $2,000 subsidy. How many pensioners will be able to afford the $6,000 to $8,000 shortfall? Not a single one. How many truck drivers, retail workers or nurses will be able to afford these expensive batteries? None; not a single one. But Labor's self-styled urban elites will be able to afford the difference and pocket the subsidy, whilst pensioners and low-income earners will pay even higher energy prices and more taxes through these subsidies. That is Labor social injustice—just another example of how Labor has lost its way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor once actually championed the battlers, the pensioners and the low-income earners. Today they champion the green elites at the expense of the battlers, as is further witnessed by their iniquitous retiree tax grab which will only impact, yet again—you've guessed it—the low-income earners. But, if the retiree tax grab is not enough, Labor will increase the cost of living of low-income earners by their green-appeasing, household-budget-and-job-destroying energy policies on renewables and batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four key planks to the Liberal policy. One is a price safety net to stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers. In fact, the Labor Party is wont to quote the Business Council of Australia—I don't actually hear the Business Council of Australia championing this Liberal policy of a price safety net to stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers. I wonder why. Possibly some of them may be members—I don't know—of the Business Council of Australia. Isn't it a stark situation when it is the Liberal Party supporting the pensioners and the low-income earners, and we have the Labor Party championing big business?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will provide a safety net to stop big power companies ripping off customers, we will stop price gouging and dodgy practices—another key plank to our policy—and we will back investment in reliable power by underwriting new electricity generation to improve competition. We will support 24/7 reliable power by requiring energy companies to sign contracts guaranteeing enough energy to meet demand. We, on this side, will always put pensioners and price before the ideology of Paris.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance regarding energy. Meaningful action on climate change in this country is long overdue. The Australian people have made their views clear. The voters of Wentworth, the voters of Victoria and the young people protesting outside this parliament this morning have all made their views clear: we must act now to reduce our emissions and stop shirking our moral responsibility to future generations. The recent IPCC report was yet another stark reminder of the urgent need for action. Reducing emissions should be a key priority of this government. As one of the wealthiest countries on earth, we should be leading the way. But the latest figures from the Department of the Environment and Energy show that our emissions are actually increasing—up 1.5 per cent from December 2016-17.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that the answers to the problem are also the most affordable and economically responsible. Renewables are now the cheapest form of new energy in Australia, and advances in batteries and pumped-hydro storage technology mean that this power can be made available 24/7. My home state of South Australia provides an example of how an influx of new renewables is putting downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. It's also delivering badly needed jobs and investment to regional Australia. As the Senate agreed in the motion I put to it this Monday, renewable energy coupled with energy storage technologies can provide fair dinkum power that is cheap, reliable and clean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy efficiency provides another good example. As study after study has shown, it not only has huge potential for reducing emissions but also can dramatically reduce our energy bills. My bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving the Energy Efficiency of Rental Properties) Bill 2018, was a direct response to this opportunity to provide cheap, reliable, clean energy with maximum savings to households.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I rise to also contribute to this matter of public importance. In doing so, I will say at the outset that I agree with Senator Storer that meaningful action on climate change is well overdue and Australia should be playing its part as a wealthy nation in the region to limit our pollution and reduce greenhouse gases. Our country—and indeed the world—is undergoing a period of rapid destruction in the energy sector. But, through innovation, scale and our need to respond to climate change, renewable energy is becoming the future of that energy mix, and rightly so. This year, 2018, has been a record year for rooftop solar installations as well as large-scale solar and wind developments. But it's vital that we have the energy policy that reflects and anticipates these market developments, our environmental obligations and the need for a transition plan from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change exclaimed recently: 'Climate change is no longer an emergency; it is a disaster.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that front, I would like to take this opportunity to outline the Morrison government's renewable energy target. Excuse the silence, but there is no policy. That, there in itself, weighs up exactly what we are dealing with in this country: a Morrison government that does not have an energy or a climate policy, a government that is missing in action. Electricity prices have increased by nearly 19 per cent in the past three years—three times as fast as wages growth. The government have blamed blackouts on wind farms, and they've treated coal as though it's some sort of panacea. In fact, the just-released 2018 United Nations <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment emissions gap report</span> makes clear that the government has no interest in climate change as there has been no improvement in Australia's climate policy. On current projections, applying the government's policy—well, lack of policy—by 2030 we will be well above the Nationally Determined Contributions target under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Under Morrison's hopeless climate change policies, carbon pollution will continue to rise all the way to 2030, which is as far as the projections currently go. It is for those reasons that moderate Liberals are now speaking out against the government's continued kowtowing to the hard-right wreckers of their party room that have dictated action on climate change and energy for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Bill Shorten aptly observed last week, the single most important thing about energy and climate right now is to actually have some sort of policy. Well, Labor does have a very comprehensive policy. Labor's energy plan, announced last week, addresses comprehensively the energy market as a whole. It delivers predictability, investor confidence, more renewables, cheaper power and more jobs. We're committed to ensuring that there's a just transition for workers in existing generation facilities that will be eventually phased out, notably coal, and for affected communities. We'll ensure households can reduce both their power bills and their carbon footprint, notably by making battery storage more affordable and improving efficiency. And we'll promote the modernisation of our energy infrastructure—in particular, by investing some $5 billion in a new energy security and modernisation fund and by doubling the original investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also realise that energy policy should not be this partisan. Our preference is to achieve some sort of bipartisan agreement, and it always has been. So we'll continue to pursue the National Energy Guarantee, which can deliver our 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. It's clear that some on the other side want to move forward in this direction. The member for Curtin has called on her colleagues to 'consider energy policy through the prism of securing bipartisan agreement with Labor', which 'must and has to be balanced with concerns for our environment and preservation of our planet'. But even the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, recently said that the Liberal Party and the coalition are not capable of dealing with climate change. Australians deserve a government that will take action on climate change, reduce pollution and invest in our renewables. Australia deserves better, and Labor is ready to be that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  Australian families and small businesses will benefit from the government's plan for affordable and reliable energy, while they would suffer enormously under the plans that are put forward by Labor, which can be described as nothing more than a throwback to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years and all of the disasters that that entailed. But, before I get onto that, let me say a few things about the Morrison government's plan for energy. For all of the complaining that we hear on the other side, there is a simple, clear, practical plan that we have seen is already reducing prices for Australian households and Australian businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, there's a price safety net to stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers who don't have time to shop around all the time for a better deal. By knowing what that base rate is, consumers will be better able to determine what really represents good value. And it will stop situations where, as we've already seen, some households are paying over $800 more per year, and small businesses nearly $3,500 more per year, than the cheapest market offer they've had. Second, we will stop price gouging and dodgy practices by big energy companies, including banning sneaky late payment penalties and making energy retailers pass on savings and wholesale prices through to consumers. These two policies are part of the government's big-stick approach which is designed to stop the rip-offs and lower power prices. You can see the opposition mock this big stick all they like, but they have to mock it because they've got nothing to compare to it. If all they can do is ridicule, it shows they have nothing to match the robustness of these measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach is already having an impact. AGL have announced cheaper power prices for over 150,000 families and 27,000 businesses. On the other hand, the Labor Party have made it clear that they're not interested in challenging these big energy companies and, instead, would prefer to protect their record profits rather than protecting consumers. While Bill Shorten shows by his actions rather than by his words that he's on the side of big energy companies every day of the week, the Morrison government have shown that we are always on the side of working Australians and small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we're backing investment in reliable power by underwriting new electricity generation to improve competition, increase supply and reduce wholesale energy prices. Fourth, we are supporting 24/7 reliable power by requiring energy companies to sign contracts that guarantee enough energy to meet demand through a reliability obligation. Clearly and simply, the coalition stands for more affordable and reliable power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast with Labor could not be starker. They can talk about things being messy all they like but, boy, there's a lot of mess on their side. Not only is this motion a mess but so too is Mr Shorten's plan for energy. Take the big battery proposal. Families come to the doors of representatives in this place day in, day out saying they cannot afford their quarterly energy bills. They demand, ask and plead that we do something about it, and Labor's answer is to say, 'Well, we'll give you a $2,000 subsidy on a big battery if you chip in $10,000 to $20,000.' If you can't afford your quarterly energy bill, you can't afford to shell out for a great big battery. And, of course, the last time Labor offered to install things in the houses of Australians, it was pink batts, and we all know how well that ended up—burning rooftops and Australians losing their lives. I know this is just another invitation for the kind of big government chaos that characterised Labor's last government, and we need to do all we can to stop a repeat of that happening in this country. It is an elitist policy, it is an unfair policy and it is a policy that puts virtue signalling on renewables over the practical bills of Australians, and that's something that the coalition does not tolerate. The coalition will fight every day of the week for cheaper energy prices for all Australians and their small businesses.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  The United Nations insists taxing carbon dioxide emissions is necessary to stop the climate warming. I am not convinced, but Labor, together with the Greens, has swallowed this rubbish hook, line and sinker. The Chief Scientist of Australia, Alan Finkel, told the Senate in June last year that reducing carbon emissions by 100 per cent would make virtually no difference to the global climate. Labor plans to ignore the advice of the Chief Scientist of Australia and embark on a plan that will destroy the living standards of most Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's unrealistic promise is to reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, but Labor has been coy about how this will be achieved. Labor's promise to create a just transitional authority recognises hundreds of thousands of workers will find themselves jobless as a result of their energy and climate policies. Mark my words: Labor's irresponsible plan to rapidly transition to a low-carbon-emitting Australia will end in tragedy. About 38 per cent of carbon emissions come from the production of electricity, gas and water, so that sector cannot, on its own, deliver the 50 per cent savings promised by Labor. So I ask: where will the savings in carbon emissions be made? There is real danger that petrol and diesel prices will rise, just as they have in France. The French government, now deeply unpopular, has increased fuel prices to pay for the transition to a low-carbon-emitting France. Additionally, they tax vehicles on the basis of their carbon emissions per kilometre travelled. Next year the French government expects cars to emit no more than 117 grams of carbon per kilometre, and it is estimated that one in four cars will emit over this level and be subject to fines up to A$15,600. Labor must rule out taxing carbon emissions on Australian vehicles, including those used in agriculture and mining. Taxing carbon emissions on vehicles would devastate the economy. Before it's too late, we need to be out of the Paris climate agreement, and we need less foreign interference in the way we make policies for Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This bill amends a number of acts relating to the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemical products in a manner that engages and limits a number of human rights, including the right to privacy, freedom of expression and criminal process rights. The statement of compatibility comprehensively sets out each of the rights that were engaged and limited by the measures in the bill, which allowed for an assessment that the measures, in context, were permissible limitations on human rights. The statement of compatibility accompanying this bill is an example of how, when human rights issues are fully addressed in the statement, the committee is able to conclude its analysis without needing to seek further information from legislation proponents.</span>

The committee has, in recent months, been undertaking a project to improve statements of compatibility including by engaging with legislation proponents and providing training. The aim is to improve the quality of statements of compatibility by explaining the committee's expectations, underpinned by the legal requirements, as to the content of the statements of compatibility and information as to how the statement of compatibility could be improved. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, the Liberal National Government launched negotiations to accede to the GPA. After three years of negotiations, Australia was formally invited to join the GPA on 17 October 2018. This Agreement will create significant opportunities for our high value, highly skilled services industries to secure more contracts that support more Australian jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The consultation process has shown there is strong support within the Australian business community for Australia's GPA accession, including architectural, engineering, agricultural, construction, and professional service providers. States and territory governments have each agreed to support Australia's accession.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Accession to the GPA also reinforces Australia's support for the multilateral trading system and the importance of trade rules. Australia's accession to the GPA demonstrates the commercially meaningful outcomes that the multilateral system can provide for our exporters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The GPA has 47 current members including the European Union, the United States, Japan, Canada, Korea and Singapore. The estimated procurement market of current members is $1.7 trillion a year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Joining the GM will mean Australian businesses will have legally bound access to these 47 markets and will be able to participate on an equal footing with local competitors in these countries. Australian businesses and service providers will be able to access new opportunities in the European Union, Canada, European Free Trade Association states, Ukraine, and Chinese Taipei, and improved access over and above some of our existing free trade agreements.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The details of these opportunities and many others are set out in detail in an attachment to the National Interest Analysis, which I also table today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By joining the GPA now, Australia will have a greater opportunity to influence the terms of new GPA parties' accession in support of our national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are nine countries, including China and Russia, currently seeking to join the GPA. Approval of new members requires them to open their government procurement market to suppliers of other parties in accordance with the GPA's principles of transparency and non-discrimination. When that happens Australia will also have new market access opportunities in those countries. China's government procurement market alone is estimated to be worth up to US$2.5 trillion annually, with expected GPA coverage of up to US$783 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's procurement framework is already based on principles of value for money, non­discrimination and open competition. Australia's procurement markets are already open to all foreign suppliers, not just those with whom we have FTAs. No additional changes to the Government's procurement system will be required in order to comply with the GPA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have ensured our terms of accession to the GPA include a range of exceptions that provide flexibility to ensure Australia can continue to make necessary policy decisions and implement important nation-building programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These include broad exceptions in areas including health, welfare and disability services. The GPA also provides the same flexibilities as Australia's existing trade agreements to enable the Government to continue its strong support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to participate in procurement opportunities. This is an important outcome as SMEs are the engine room of the Australian economy — accounting for more than 99 per cent of Australian businesses. And around 30 per cent of SMEs (more than 700,000) are located in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the GPA supports the continuation of the Coalition Government's landmark Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP). In the first two years since the Indigenous Procurement Policy commenced, the Commonwealth has awarded 4,880 contracts with a total value of $594 million to 956 Indigenous-owned businesses. This is a 95-fold increase on Indigenous businesses winning Commonwealth contracts prior to the IPP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Necessary security procurements are also exempt, such as defence materiel, systems and equipment. The GPA also has no impact on the Australian Industry Capability Program, which provides opportunities for Australian businesses and Australian workers to help grow Australia's Defence industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The states and territories are supportive of Australia's accession, and have all included exceptions to allow them to address specific sensitivities and largely continue with existing procurement arrangements, such as health and education services, and motor vehicle exceptions for South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Accession to the GPA is a further demonstration of the Liberal National Government's proven record in initiating and delivering trade and economic outcomes for Australian businesses, exporters and service providers. This is in stark contrast to the protectionist policies of the Opposition that aim to undo the hard fought market access gains we've secured for Australian businesses and consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I welcome the consideration of these opportunities by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) so that Australia can start to reap the benefits of greater market access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hereby table the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement, the terms of Australia's accession, along with its National Interest Analysis, and commend them to the Senate.</span>

The UDI system could provide a single, globally harmonised system for identification of medical devices within healthcare supply chains and clinical care systems.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Humanitarian entrants and their families will continue to be exempt from all waiting periods. This exemption acknowledges that refugees settling here under the Humanitarian Program are particularly vulnerable.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I oppose the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I suspect the Liberal Democrats will be the only party opposing this bill. It is not because the Liberal Democrats are evil, even though those in politics, the media and the public who are fond of caricature and incapable of nuance would have you think so. We oppose the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 because it will do no good and at the same time it will do real harm. The bill does no good because Australian criminal law already prohibits modern slavery in Australia and abroad. Australian police already enforce these laws within their powers and Australian governments already provide services to victims. I'm sure those keen to show how virtuous they are would like to be able to ban evil things twice, but, alas, this is not possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill actually does is impose reporting requirements on around 3,000 organisations in Australia. These reporting requirements will cost each organisation, on average, around $22,000 a year. This is a $66 million annual burden, where the $66 million would otherwise be spent on useful things. Imposing this reporting requirement makes us all a little bit poorer, and for what? Can anyone imagine a scenario where a reporting requirement stops some modern slavery?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Organisations are being asked to prepare reports on risks of modern slavery in their supply chains. Modern slavery is not simply about workers in chains or even just servitude and forced labour, but includes debt bondage, forced marriage and human trafficking. No-one would disagree with the desire to ensure none of these were occurring, but, if there is any modern slavery in an organisation's supply chain in Australia, someone is guilty of a serious criminal offence. These things are crimes. I can't see how the organisation will confess to this to the police by writing it up in a report. Even if there were no fear of criminal prosecution, what organisation will ruin its own reputation by reporting that there are risks of modern slavery in its supply chains? This is akin to asking everyday Australians to report to the police whether they have done anything criminal—as if those who had done something criminal would admit to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is modern slavery in the supply chain overseas, how is a company in Australia to know?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, it can ask, but what credence could be placed on the reply? Can you imagine an overseas supplier telling their Australian customer: 'Oh, sure. We have slaves working for us'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me pull out my crystal ball and give you a glimpse of the future. Each of the 3,000 organisations will say they oppose modern slavery and are diligently ensuring that any risk of modern slavery is being addressed in their supply chains. There will be no scrutiny of the reports, noting that today's bill provides for no scrutiny whatsoever. There will be no hot leads for our police to pursue. No behaviours will change, and 3,000 reports will gather dust. What a complete waste of time. But what an invitation to future governments to make it compulsory to report, as Labor already wants to do, to make it illegal to buy from suppliers until they report and to get certified at significant cost, of course, with some NGO providing the certification and clipping the ticket. That's no fantasy either: we've already got that with the importation of timber. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world has gone mad, falling over itself to demonstrate its virtue. It might be fashionable to support this modern slavery bill, but fashion has obviously never been my concern. The Liberal Democrats do the right thing, and the right thing here is to oppose this pointless bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  In rising to speak to the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 and the committee stages of it, I want to note what a big step forward we are taking as a country in addressing modern slavery, not only in Australia but very much in our global supply chains. We often think of slavery as something of the past and, for most people in Australia, the transatlantic slave trade will come to mind; however, we have our own history of slavery in Australia, including in our convict times and with our First Nations people. We consider slavery as a relic of a much less enlightened time, but, indeed, we have more slaves in the world now than we have ever had in history. Some 48.5 million people are living in slavery-like conditions. They exist in a wide variety of private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering the bill before us today and the amendments that will be moved by the opposition and others, it's important to consider that this bill needs to be the best it possibly can be. We have in Australia a strong rule of law and we should expect that it prevents horrific exploitation of workers, but, sadly, the opposite is true. We live in an interconnected globalised society. We have everyday items that are sold and produced by businesses operating in Australia that can be, and have been seen to be, tainted by slavery and complex supply chains that increase the chance that slavery has been used to produce the goods that Australians use every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the best efforts of Australians, it can be very difficult to determine whether slavery has been used to produce certain goods in our supply chain as well as the clandestine nature of the slave trade. In our own region, we know that two-thirds of people who are known globally to be trapped in slavery are in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a region we're intrinsically linked with. Not only that; it is estimated that some 4,500 people in Australia are trapped in slavery-like conditions, and we have seen recent examples of that. While it's obviously illegal, we need to find and stamp out this behaviour and we need to find the evidence of it. The exploitative situation that people find themselves in when they are in slavery-like conditions means people can be very difficult to find. It's multiple abuses of power that cause people to be made vulnerable in this way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have championed the Modern Slavery Bill, but we would also like to see strengthening of this policy. We'd like, for example, to see companies earning over $100 million required to submit annual reports outlining their actions to address modern slavery, rather than the lack of transparency around that currently. It needs to be public so that we know which organisations and companies have an obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Reynolds has used the committee report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee to good effect in addressing some of these issues. It was a pleasure to work with Senator Macdonald in prosecuting some of these issues, and it's good to see those issues responded to. From the opposition's point of view, though, they don't go far enough. For example, we see that the Modern Slavery Business Engagement Unit will be established within the Department of Home Affairs—and the government responded to our committee recommendations by beefing that up somewhat—but the Labor Party had wanted to see, and is still committed to, an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to be able to see independent oversight of things like the public list of companies, in order to ensure that there's transparency and accountability. We want the public to know what companies are doing to help stamp out slavery in their supply chains, and we believe that citizens should be actively involved in being able to exert pressure on companies that fail to meet these expectations. The Australian public have no appetite for slavery and want to see support for companies that take measures to ensure an ethical supply chain. This is about transparency, and it is also about the Australian government giving companies a platform so that we can look at the supply chain and ensure transparency. That would give consumers a choice in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We very much support this bill and commend the government for moving to address this issue, but we do wish that it had gone further, and we want to express our concerns with some of the elements of the proposed bill. We are concerned about the lack of penalties—that there is no incentive for companies to actually comply, short of public scrutiny. We have been through the sentiments of the opt-in system, but this bill does little to enforce compliance. We would propose penalties for noncompliance, civil penalties for failing to report within an immediate start date and a penalty provision for submitting an inadequate report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not going to pursue amendments, even though we will put them. We know that, while many stakeholders would like to see amendments succeed to the end that I've expressed, it's been sad that the government hasn't been able to accept that these things should be in the bill, which has left us in the situation where, unfortunately, the optimum situation in order to not threaten the bill is to ensure that it passes without amendment. I think that's a shame. I think that's a big shame. If you were to play up the stakes on these things and the government were to say, 'Well, if you pass this amendment then we have to reject the bill,' that would be a great shame, because there was overwhelming support from stakeholders for some of these changes. Nevertheless, it is important that this legislation does progress and will be seen to make a real difference in addressing slavery in the global supply chain as well as here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we want to see compliance and we want to see enforcement. We do see issues with the Anti-Slavery Business Engagement Unit. The intent is admirable, but we don't want to see a unit that's buried inside the department and is focused on assisting businesses instead of focused on victims. We don't think this is sufficient for tackling the issues of slavery in Australia or globally. That is why we supported an independent slavery commissioner and the idea that setting up a commissioner should be seen as a way of bringing about real and further change in this area. We want to see a commissioner who can work with the victims of slavery, receive inquiries and complaints, work with businesses to develop best practices to protect their supply chains and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery. This is a lot more than just a business engagement unit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we think it's important to remove forced marriage from the reporting requirements and, instead, match Labor's forced-marriage policy. We have a comprehensive plan and approach to tackling the issue of forced marriage, and we don't think this has a place within the Modern Slavery Bill. It's a very serious issue that must be addressed, but it has different elements that also have much in common with domestic violence and other forms of forced servitude in Australia, not just slavery. Other concerns with this bill have been raised by community groups, business leaders and members of the public, including the need to lower the threshold for companies from $100 million down to $50 million in line with legislation in the UK and New South Wales, and also ideas have been put forward about the National Compensation Scheme to assist victims of trafficking and human slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While all these things that I've raised are important, the Labor Party believes that the current bill is a very important step forward. We would like to see it amended, but we appreciate the fact that we are, frankly, wedged. It is high time we saw this legislation passed and done so that the nation can get on with implementing these reforms. I was pleased to see a commitment to review these provisions, and that is in the legislation. That is an important outcome from the work we did as a Senate committee. If the Labor Party doesn't immediately come to government after the next election, whereby we can implement these things ourselves, the review process allows us to ensure that, in time, the issues that I've outlined in my remarks this evening are indeed addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Slavery is an absolutely horrendous act that has no place in modern life, and the Labor Party is committed to stamping it out in this country and overseas. We support the strong premise of this bill but call on the government to support the amendments we have proposed. I'm saddened that we seem to have been in a place where amendments won't get support simply because that would jeopardise the progress of the bill. Nevertheless, I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>): Centre Alliance supports this bill as a much-needed first step towards tackling the issues of modern slavery in business supply chains. According to the 2018 Global Slavery Index, over $10 billion worth of goods imported each year into Australia may have been produced under conditions of slave labour—$10 billion. Amongst the highest-risk goods are those found in every Australian household and workplace, such as clothing, mobile phones and computers. That is billions of dollars spent by our nation to reward the reprehensible scum who feed off this evil and insidious trade in human lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although it is less prevalent here than in some overseas countries, we must also not forget that, to our greatest shame, Australia is not immune from modern slavery, with an estimated 15,000 people on any given day trapped in this misery. Sit down with any Australian and ask if they would knowingly prefer to buy something—say a pair of shoes—which has been made through slave labour, shoes that have been made by a human being just like them except that, instead of being free to live their life, that person is forced through deception, through threats of violence or because they are a defenceless child, to work endless hours per day in unbearable and unsafe conditions for little or no pay and with little hope of escape. Ask any Australian, and the answer is always a resounding no. Ask any ordinary Australian if they would be happy for their taxes to be spent supporting this immoral conduct—again, a resounding no. So how is it possible that, as a nation that prides itself on fairness and compassion, we are potentially paying billions of dollars per year perpetuating slavery?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A major part of this problem is that we do this because we don't know about it, and we don't know about it because modern slavery is hidden. Take, for example, one of our biggest spenders of public money: Defence. Four years ago, Australian-owned Rossi Boots lost out on a $15 million contract to supply boots to the Australian Defence Force. Rossi Boots is based in South Australia and has manufactured footwear in my home state since 1910. Its employees are paid a living wage and they work in regulated and very safe conditions. The Department of Defence chose instead to award the tender for these army boots to a company which supplies boots manufactured in Indonesia, a country that has slave labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To its credit, Indonesia has made significant progress in the last 25 years towards stopping child labour and has committed to eliminating it completely by 2022. But, at the present time, child labour still exists there. Indonesia is also committed to combating other forms of modern slavery. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that currently more than 1.2 million people in Indonesia live in conditions of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rossi Boots was reportedly advised that its bid was unsuccessful because of 'value-for-money considerations'. It's a no-brainer that paying workers properly rather than treating them as slaves will result in a product that costs a bit more. So are the boots of our Defence Force personnel tainted with slavery that has been subsidised by the Australian taxpayer? The answer is: I seriously hope not, but we simply don't know, and that is precisely the point of this very important bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with my colleague Rex Patrick in acknowledging the ongoing contribution of Skye Kakoschke-Moore to tackling this issue through her work, both previously in the Senate and as a special adviser to the International Justice Mission, the world's largest antislavery organisation. I also reiterate that this bill is not perfect, but what it will do is begin to shine a light into the dark and noxious crevices where modern slavery festers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If passed, this legislation will require entities with substantial market power, specifically the Commonwealth and companies with a turnover greater than $100 million per annum, firstly to turn their mind to the issue of slavery within their supply chains and, secondly, to publicly identify what they are doing to mitigate the risk that slavery is occurring within those supply chains. Accordingly, implementation of the provisions of this bill will start to give some assurance to the public that care is being taken to prevent taxpayer money going to fund unconscionable practices. Its implementation will also enable the public to see exactly what large corporations are doing to identify and expunge this scourge from their businesses and hold to account companies that are not doing the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In making information about a company's antislavery credentials publicly available, the silence of companies that fail to report will be deafening. I believe that in the near future any such silence will pose a significant reputational risk, so I look forward to this legislation initiating a race to the top by corporate Australia, a race that will see companies not otherwise required to report choosing voluntarily to do so. Indeed, there are already Australian companies doing business by doing the right thing. I want to mention one of them here: Outland Denim. Outland Denim came to worldwide attention when, on her recent trip to Australia, the Duchess of Sussex chose to wear a pair of their jeans. Outland Denim employs women rescued from human trafficking in Cambodia and uses only ethically- and environmentally-sound raw material in their product lines. The company considers transparency to be the key to keeping supply chains above reproach, and prominently lists on the company website the names of their suppliers and information about their practices. Outland Denim is leading the way in terms of ethical supply chains and is a great Australian success story that deserves to be celebrated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance commends this bill as a much-needed first step, but also retains a number of concerns with the bill. These include the fact that no penalty is imposed for noncompliance with reporting requirements and that the bill makes no provision for listing the names of all companies required to report. That, in particular, is a very important consideration. Such a list would, in our view, provide for greater transparency and accountability in the reporting framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we consider that the failure of the bill to establish an antislavery commissioner is a missed opportunity for ensuring this issue is comprehensively dealt with. As the UK experience has shown, an antislavery commissioner would play an invaluable role in overseeing the operation of the legislation; raising awareness of modern slavery; educating and assisting government agencies and companies with identification; and mitigation of risks of modern slavery in supply chains.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance will be voting for this bill, but we will continue to advocate strongly for measures to be implemented that will ensure it is delivering on its objective, to root out this filthy trade.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="275424" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STORER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  It's hard to believe that, in this day and age, we still need a bill like this. The accounts of slavery and trafficking occurring right here in Australia are surprising and incredibly saddening. Over the last months I have learnt more about our national risk of slavery and trafficking, and I've come to realise that our lucky country isn't so lucky for many people. It has led me to ask two questions: 'What are we doing to ensure this does not happen here?' and, 'Are we doing enough?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's what I've learnt. Australia has assumed a leadership role in the region on modern slavery. With this legislation, we are now poised to lead the world in modern slavery transparency reporting. We have strong criminal legislation that supports a framework for victim witnesses working with law enforcement to prosecute traffickers and slave holders, and a national action plan that lays out the government's domestic and international response to this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, what I've learnt is that, despite these commendable efforts, Australia's performance against that plan's overarching goals, which are prevention, protection and prosecution, is not as strong as it could be or should be. In fact, I'm very concerned to hear that, since Australia incorporated trafficking in persons offences into our Criminal Code in around 2003, fewer than 400 victims have received assistance from our national support program. Only 21 offenders have been convicted of a slavery-related offence. There is no specifically designated funding for our national action plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Australia is a primary destination for labour migration in the region, with a growing reliance on temporary migrant workers. Indeed, we have been hearing calls from various quarters to introduce a new visa for migrant farm workers and to increase incentives for backpackers to work on farms. Overwhelming evidence of exploitation has come forward through the modern slavery inquiry and other reports, and we know, from this and from academic research, that migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and labour trafficking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is believed that Australia's risk of modern slavery is real and is likely to be greater than the statistics suggest. I'm concerned that, while we're doing a lot of good, well-intentioned work, we are somehow missing the mark and this is resulting in vulnerable people going without protection and without support and possibly being left to languish in violent and abusive situations right here in our backyard, and the offenders just keep offending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have found that the development of Australia's domestic response has been hindered by the perception that opportunities to traffic people into or exploit people within Australia are limited because of our strong migration controls, geographic isolation and high degree of regulation compliance and enforcement. Yet, compared to similar countries—and certainly in comparison with the UK, which has provided the model for our consideration of a modern slavery act—Australia has not committed substantial resources or efforts to bolster the identification of victims. To do so we would need to fund more outreach, more public education and certainly more training of first responders. We also need to ensure that our first responders are funded and supported to vigorously pursue criminals; yet there is only a handful of specialist AFP teams around the country looking into this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that there does not appear to be any kind of independent evaluation and monitoring of the national response and no clear accountability for outcomes under the national action plan. How much more evidence will be required in order for us to constructively critique our own efforts and ask why we aren't finding more victims and prosecuting more traffickers? What impetus is required for us to find the courage to admit that we could and must do better? The consequences of our reluctance to challenge ourselves mean that, notwithstanding this legislation, which will introduce new strategies to engage business in eradicating modern slavery, we are otherwise lagging behind other nations in antislavery work. Without independent oversight, how can we be sure that we are honestly evaluating ourselves? Is it fair and reasonable to expect public servants to be able to effectively scrutinise the activity of their bosses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is there have been a range of recommendations made to improve our response to this problem. There have been various reviews and planning processes. In 2008 an ANAO review made a range of recommendations, noting that our response lacked a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess whether actions under the national action plan are succeeding in achieving their ultimate goals. It is my understanding that, 10 years later, there is still no monitoring and evaluation framework. The ANAO also recommended the government establish a national estimate, and yet this work has only begun.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear that, without intended oversight, government must be monitored to keep the commitments it makes. It was on this basis that I decided to propose an amendment to this bill to establish an independent antislavery adviser, which I was pleased to have senators Hinch and Patrick agree to co-sponsor. I appreciate the significant assistance from Heather Moore of the Salvation Army on this, and on this issue in general. Under that proposal, the adviser would be tasked with supporting the operation of the act, specifically by encouraging best practice in the prevention, detention, investigation and prosecution of modern slavery, and supporting victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK Modern Slavery Act, on which this bill is modelled, includes an independent antislavery commissioner. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended the creation of an independent statutory officer to support the operation of the act when it concluded an inquiry into this bill in August of this year. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner when it concluded its own detailed inquiry into this issue in December 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it was with surprise that I learned that the government had an aversion to the idea, given that coalition MPs and senators have consistently voted in favour of including this role. Needless to say, this role also has widespread support among civil society groups, and I am not aware of a single business touched by this bill that is opposed to the idea. Nevertheless, I am an incrementalist at my core. I have made a point of remaining pragmatic in my decision-making in this place and not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. I was told that, should my amendment have succeeded, as I believe it would have, it would have jeopardised the passage of this bill, as the government would not have brought it back before the other place. That being the case, I agreed not to proceed with introducing my detailed amendment on an independent antislavery adviser. However, today I moved a new second reading amendment that called on the government to appoint an independent antislavery commissioner to support the operation of the Modern Slavery Act. I hope the government will heed that advice in the future. Whilst this is a relatively displeasing situation, I believe that the legislative policy work on the independent antislavery adviser will not be wasted and can be used sometime in the future. Indeed, I note that the act will be reviewed after three years and I hope that an independent antislavery adviser or commissioner will be introduced then if it has not already been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity to achieve something truly significant here in this chamber this evening. I encourage all to support the passage of this bill so that we as a nation can take another step forward towards ending the blight of modern slavery in our world. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Modern Slavery Bill is a major milestone in Australia's response to modern slavery. As we know, the bill will establish a national modern slavery reporting requirement to hold large businesses accountable for their actions to prevent and address modern slavery. The government is committed to ensuring that the reporting requirement will lead to meaningful and effective change. Today I am pleased to move amendments to the bill to further strengthen the operation of the reporting requirements. I thank senators in this chamber who have worked with me to develop these, and the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, chaired by Senator Macdonald, which also made recommendations we are acting on today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's amendments make three key changes to the bill before us. Firstly, the amendments will empower the minister to require suspected non-compliant entities to explain their noncompliance and take remedial action. The minister will also have the power to publicly name entities that do not comply. This ensures that the bill provides an appropriate mechanism to address suspected cases of noncompliance with the reporting requirement over the first three years of its operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the amendments will explicitly require the three-year review of the reporting requirement to consider if additional compliance mechanisms are required, including civil penalties. The review will also consider the necessity for, and timing of, future reviews. Consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, this will establish a clear pathway to future civil penalties if initial compliance rates are inadequate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the amendments will require the minister responsible for the legislation to report annually to the parliament about the implementation of the reporting requirement, including compliance trends. This will ensure the reporting requirement is subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation by the parliament. The annual reports will also provide an evidence base to inform the three-year review and, as I said, the review will consider if and when future reviews are required, which directly relates to one of the issues Senator McKim had. I and the government believe that these amendments reflect international best practice and will ensure the reporting requirement makes a significant impact in the fight against modern slavery.</span>

We should not be leaving it to big business to police themselves on slavery. We're impressed by the genuine passion in the business community, and in the broader Australian community, to fight slavery. We all have a shared commitment to stamping out this practice. But we are worried some companies will not comply with the bill in its current form. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate committee, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam, called for penalties to be included in the bill. The government's decision to leave penalties out of the bill was profoundly disappointing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment provides that the minister can request an explanation from an entity that has failed to comply with its reporting requirement. If that entity doesn't explain, then the minister can publish the identity of that entity. This is better than no response, but it is far, far weaker than the Labor proposed penalty regime. The government is also proposing to introduce the requirement for the minister to report annually about the operation of the act. This is not as strong as Labor's proposed report by the minister, but it is an improvement on the original bill, so the opposition will also support this amendment. We are also supporting the introduction of the three-year review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments would remove forced marriage from the reporting requirements which would be established by this bill.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is risk that requiring entities to assess risk of this practice may lead to unintended negative consequences, including racial and/or religious profiling of some staff.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, Good Shepherd, in its submission to the same inquiry, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a likelihood that the reporting requirement may function as a barrier to prevention.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that hundreds, and potentially thousands, of young Australians are at risk of forced marriage each year. Instead of driving this practice further underground, we should be supporting victims and vulnerable people at risk of forced marriage. Earlier this year Labor announced that a Shorten Labor government, if elected, would completely overhaul our response to forced marriage. Labor, if elected, has committed to establishing a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to the support they need. We have also committed to increasing funding for civil society to support victims. Crucially, it would involve the full removal of the cooperation requirement, which requires victims to assist in the prosecution, often of their parents, in order to access government funded support. If the government are serious about addressing this issue, they should support these amendments and match Labor's forced marriage policy. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  The government does not support these amendments. I'd like to explain why. We don't believe that the bill should be amended to remove forced marriage from the definition of modern slavery. The government and I as the minister have carefully considered this issue in consultation with over 100 expert business and civil society stakeholders. Their feedback has overwhelmingly supported including forced marriage. This is because some entities may directly contribute to forced marriage through their business activities. For example, a mining company may report on forced marriage risks because it runs remote overseas accommodation camps for workers who are forcibly marrying local women. The bill will also apply to religious entities. These entities may choose to include information in their statements about their actions to ensure that forced marriages do not occur as part of their services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this bill does not require entities to investigate or assess the private activities of their employees. Entities only need to report on forced marriage risks where they could directly contribute to this crime through their own business activities. Our approach to forced marriage is consistent with the way we will require entities to report on all other modern slavery risks linked to their business activities. For example, members have highlighted the vulnerability of private domestic workers to modern slavery. Under this bill, we will expect companies that provide private domestic workers for their overseas employees to report on what they are doing to ensure these workers are not exploited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach is also consistent with the Senate committee report on the bill. The Senate committee did not recommend any changes to the current definition of modern slavery in the bill. It's for these reasons that the government will not be supporting these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  These amendments from the opposition would remove forced marriage from the definition of modern slavery. The Greens won't be supporting them, fundamentally because we believe that forced marriage actually is a form of modern slavery. It's also important to note that forced marriage can, in some circumstances, be coupled with other forms of modern slavery. We also make the point that Senator Reynolds has just made, which is that nothing in this legislation will require any companies who are caught to report in any way on the private affairs of their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out that articles 1 and 2 of the UN Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery liken forced marriage to slavery. A range of organisations here in Australia and internationally, including Anti-Slavery Australia, Anti-Slavery International, Walk Free Foundation, the International Labour Organization and Free the Slaves, all consider forced marriage to be a form of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Farrell talked us through, in very general terms, the policy on forced marriage that Labor is intending to take to the upcoming election. From what Senator Farrell has just said, that sounds like a very good policy. On the basis of what Senator Farrell has put to the Senate this evening on that policy, it would absolutely be something that the Greens could support. However, we don't see the inclusion of forced marriage in this legislation as part of the definition of modern slavery as mutually exclusive in any way to address the issue of forced marriage in the way that Senator Farrell has outlined. So we won't be supporting this amendment.</span>

As we've said over and over again, big business cannot be trusted to police themselves on modern slavery. The experience overseas makes the need for penalties crystal clear. Anti-Slavery Australia provided evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill to show that, in the United Kingdom, in the three years since the UK Modern Slavery Act's enactment, only about half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations that the UK government estimates are required to report have produced a slavery and human trafficking statement. That's simply not good enough. Labor does not want to see only half of the companies complying with the requirements of this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  The government doesn't support these amendments. Firstly, in relation to including penalties for noncompliance, the bill should not be amended to include civil penalties for noncompliance. Critically, business feedback shows that market scrutiny as well as reputational risk and reward will drive compliance more effectively than punitive penalties. A penalty regime would be complex and resource intensive, and would likely require a new regulatory enforcement body. Imposing penalties would also not address the most likely reason for noncompliance over the first three years, which is largely implementation. These barriers to compliance are best addressed by providing support to businesses to actually assist them to comply rather than through penalties. This is the exact reason why the government has committed $3.6 million to establish a business engagement unit to advise and support businesses through this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also proposed amendments, which have just passed, to strengthen compliance by empowering the minister to require an entity to explain and remedy noncompliance, empowering the minister to publicly name a noncompliant entity and also providing a clear pathway to future penalties if compliance rates are found to be inadequate at the mandatory three-year review. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee did support the government's approach to penalties and, as recommended by the committee, the proposed amendments specify that penalties will be considered at the three-year review rather than imposing penalties at this early stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the requirement for the minister to report annually to the parliament listing noncompliant activities, the government has moved amendments, which have already passed, to require the minister to report annually to parliament, and the government will also publish lists of all entities that do not report on the central register of statements. The bill should not be amended further to require an annual report to list all entities that have not complied. This is due to a range of practical impediments which have been discussed previously in this chamber. As recommended by the committee, we will continue to explore the options to publish a list in future, once we have compiled the list. This does not require legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  The Australian Greens will support this amendment from the Australian Labor Party which effectively inserts penalties for failure to comply with provisions in this legislation. We think this will significantly strengthen the bill. We accept that there's a philosophical difference between the coalition parties and the Greens in terms of the level of trust that we have in big business to do the right thing. We believe that it is important to work with business to bring them along on this journey but that we need to keep an appropriately sized stick in the back of our legislative pocket to ensure that there are ramifications for any business which fails to comply.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to these amendments put forward this evening by the Australian Greens, I would like to make it clear to the chamber that, although the legislation as currently drafted does, in fact, contain provisions for post-remediation removal of responsibilities, it has been noted, very vocally in fact, by the Western Australian Local Government Association, in their submission to the inquiry into this bill, that there is substantial evidence that telecommunication carriers have a poor track record on satisfactorily remediating land and structures after installations have been completed. As such, these amendments seek to strengthen the remediation provisions with the addition of 'to the satisfaction of the land owner' to its condition before the installation began.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are simple amendments which seek to do nothing more than ensure that the proprietors of these installations are required to clean up the mess they make. It's not a radical suggestion. It's not something which I would imagine anybody in this chamber with common sense could have a strong objection to. It therefore strikes me as particularly strange that I suspect this amendment does not enjoy the support of this chamber, particularly the support of the ALP. Over the last year I have had the pleasure of working alongside many senators from the opposition. Many of them I do not agree with on certain policy points, but they are good, honourable, quick-thinking people. I'm thinking particularly of Senator McCarthy and Senator Moore when I make those comments. I feel that a party containing such folks should be able to easily apply itself to such a simple suggestion as is contained within the amendments I put forward this evening. Therefore, I find myself quite puzzlingly disappointed by the fact that I suspect the ALP will not be getting on board with this amendment. As to the government's opposition to the proposed wording of this amendment, it doesn't surprise me in the least, unfortunately. This is a piece of legislative work which, according to the wording that has been given to us, apparently seeks to remove unnecessary burdens from information carriers. I don't think it's an unnecessary burden to have to clean up the mess you make if you install one of these towers. I grant that some of that is laid out within the legislation, but what is the harm in making this language clear and removing ambiguity? I can't see any at all. That's why we've put it forward in the amendment in the way that we have. I commend it to the chamber and thank the chamber for its time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  One of the achievements of this coalition government which is of benefit to the majority but of inestimable value to the few is the enhancement of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the addition of more life-saving medicines. A scheme like the PBS, which can save and prolong lives, is a key feature of an advanced and compassionate society. The PBS became a comprehensive scheme in 1960 under the government of Sir Robert Menzies. It's established under the National Health Act of 1953. It's a key component of the National Medicines Policy, with the objective to improve the positive health outcomes for all Australians through access to and wise use of medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government continues to make more medicines available and more affordable on the PBS, with an overall budgeted cost since coming to government in October 2013 to May 2018 of about $9 billion. There's no expenditure cap to the PBS, and new drugs can be added as new ones come online. That's, however, only the case if there's money in the bank to pay for them. This government has been highly effective in adding new drugs to the PBS since 2013, in part due to its excellent financial management, which has allowed the program to be enhanced with more and more of these life-saving drugs. The most recent addition is Orkambi, which treats cystic fibrosis. It will significantly extend the lives of patients while saving families up to $250,000 a year. Patients will only pay a maximum of $39.50 per script, with concession patients paying just $6.40.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth listing some of the other drugs that the coalition has put on the PBS. If there's a measure of how effective and caring a government can be, perhaps this is the measure. In August, the government announced it would make $250 million available for four life-changing cancer medicines to become available to thousands of Australians. A drug called Opdivo, made available for people suffering from a type of head and neck cancer, would have otherwise cost $50,000 a year. A drug named Imbruvica treats patients with a subtype of lymphoma cancer, relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. They will have access to that drug when they would have otherwise been up for $134,000 a year. Patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer treatment will benefit from Neulasta, which helps the body to make a type of white blood cell that's needed to help with their recovery, saving them over $4,500 per course of chemotherapy. Patients with rare types of leukaemia cancer called myeloproliferative neoplasms, who would otherwise pay more than $18,000 a year, will now benefit from the listing of Pegasys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have also announced the subsidy of new medicines for hepatitis C and diabetes. Mavyret will help Australians living with hepatitis C and save them $50,000 per course of treatment. It works by stopping the hep C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells. Australians living with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be more easily able to regulate their blood sugar levels with the listing of Ryzodeg on the PBS, which would have normally cost around $930 a year. If you were a woman suffering from breast cancer, Kisqali would have cost you $71,820 a year. Now it's subsidised. Spinraza, which helps people who have spinal muscular atrophy and who would have had to pay $367,000 per year, is also subsidised. I could keep going and going and going. It's really important that we understand it's good financial management that makes this possible. While the Labor Party likes to portray itself as the party of the health system, the supporter of public health, it failed on this front. It managed the budget so poorly that it couldn't list new drugs on the PBS that should have been listed. Every day of the week, this government delivers for the health system and all Australians by using good financial management to make these life-saving treatments available for all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  Last week I had the pleasure of walking in the shoes of an aged-care worker as part of the health and community services campaign. I walked in the shoes of an aged-care worker at Tyler Village in Prospect in my home state of Tasmania. I want to acknowledge from the outset the concerns a lot of people have about the shocking aged-care stories we've seen highlighted in the media recently. There are around 340,000 people currently working in the aged-care system, and most of them work very, very hard day in, day out delivering the service and care that older Australians need. These workers undertake one of the most important jobs in our society, and that is to look after, care for and give respect to older Australians. Over the years I've visited many aged-care homes right around this country, and I can tell you it doesn't matter if the home is new or old; the workers and carers are the beating heart of the home. The home is only as good as the management and dedicated staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tyler Village is a warm and inviting home for residents and their families, and I really enjoyed my time with the staff and residents. This experience only confirmed my view of how dedicated and respectful staff are, not only at Tyler Village but around this country. Many of the staff have worked at the home for years. One staff member has been working for this particular home for over 35 years, and others were generationally known, with their families having a proud history of working at this home. My time in the kitchen, roster room, pharmacy room and dining room, and speaking with residents, reinforced my belief in the staff and how seriously they take their roles. For these people, it's not a job; it's a privilege.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken before about how I believe aged care is one of the most important sectors to be involved in. There is so much potential and so many career opportunities going forward, but it is hard work, and it's tough. We have a serious aged-care workforce shortage in this country, and there just aren't enough workers. Aged-care workers, whether personal carers, nurses, cooks, cleaners or administration staff, are overworked, undervalued and underpaid. But they are doing their best, something I witnessed last week at Tyler Village. In the kitchen, for instance, there were two staff serving the meals and two staff delivering those meals into the dining room, and I was able to assist them. The meals were of excellent quality—good, well-balanced and very nutritious. But the thing that impressed me most was the fact that those women working in the kitchen really knew and understood the individual residents they were caring and cooking for. They knew whether or not the food had to be cut up, whether they liked beans or whether they didn't like broccoli. There was a personal touch very evident in that dining room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also say that those women who work in the kitchen and do the cooking and the cleaning up are under pressure all the time to bring out the breakfast, the morning tea, the lunch, the afternoon tea and the dinner. All of that is pressure. We all know that there's been so little money invested in aged care, and this pressure is starting to tell on the staff. The job is not only physically and mentally demanding but also emotionally very taxing for these workers, and I really, truly don't believe they get credit for the valuable work they do. I'd also like to talk about the experience of working alongside the workers doing this important work. It made them feel like they were being appreciated, that someone was listening and that someone was interested in what they were doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there have been some really terrible instances of abuse since the announcement of the royal commission into the aged-care sector and the airing of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners </span>program, where aged-care workers, in their uniforms, going about their daily business after work, have been abused by the public and, in some cases, they've been spat on because they happen to work in this sector. That's not the message we need to send to Australians. We want more people to work in this sector. We really don't believe that anyone should be bullied or abused in any workplace at all. I would just remind people that the majority of the people working in the aged-care sector are dedicated, committed and caring. I would urge people to think twice before they start to abuse people for the job that they do. I would like to thank HACSU for enabling me to visit and work alongside these workers. I want to thank Tyler Village for giving me that opportunity as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I say that, noting that the UK parliament hasn't lost its. Last week, the chair of their parliament's culture, media and sports select committee invoked its power to compel the founder of the US software company Six4Three to hand over internal Facebook documents during a business trip to London. The Serjeant at Arms was dispatched to seize internal Facebook documents from the Six4Three owner, Ted Kramer, after CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly refused to appear before a parliamentary inquiry. When Kramer failed to hand over the documents, he was escorted to the parliament and told that, if he didn't hand them over, he'd risk fines and imprisonment. He duly handed over the documents, which are believed to contain explosive revelations about Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, including confidential correspondence with Mr Zuckerberg.</span>

Section 49 of our Constitution states that the Australian parliament enjoys the same privileges that the House of Commons did at the time of Federation. To find out what that means, you should go to a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">A Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament</span> by Sir Thomas Erskine May, a former clerk of the House of Commons. The 1893 edition clearly sets out the powers of the UK parliament then and, therefore, of ours. It's required reading for all federal politicians. It confirms that the Australian parliament can enforce the powers and immunities it has to enable it to conduct its job properly and efficiently. Chapter III gives numerous examples of arrests and imprisonments for contempt over the centuries. On page 54 it states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When the house has ordered the Serjeant to execute a warrant, the house sustains his authority, and punishes those who resist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the assistance the Serjeant at Arms can receive from civil authorities to execute such a warrant, it states that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Both houses consider every branch of the civil government as bound to assist, when required, in executing their warrants and orders, and have repeatedly required such assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… all mayors, sheriffs, under-sheriffs, bailiffs, constables, headboroughs, and officers of the house are required to be aiding and assisting in the execution—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">of warrants and orders. And it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the journals abound with cases in which witnesses have been punished … for pre-varicating or giving false testimony, or suppressing the truth; for refusing to answer questions, or to produce documents in their possession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly interested in one story which ended with two judges being arrested. In 1689 an action was brought against the Serjeant at Arms for executing the orders of the house in arresting certain persons. The Serjeant at Arms pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, but his plea was overruled and judgment was given against him. The house declared this to be a breach of privilege, and committed the judges, Sir F Pemberton and Sir T Jones, to the custody of the Serjeant at Arms. That's how the UK parliament did its job several hundred years ago—and, indeed, last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of this year, Thales, a defence company, unlawfully tendered documents to the Federal Court which were subject to parliamentary privilege. Of course, the court fulfilled its obligation to make a determination as to whether or not that evidence was covered by privilege. But, thus far, the parliament has done nothing about the breach. It really rests on the parliament to protect its own privileges and rights. It's not something we subcontract out to the courts. The privilege belongs to the parliament and extends to people when they make submissions to inquiries or petitions to the parliament. I will be bitterly disappointed if the JCPAA, which is aware of the breach, doesn't find its mojo. The breach should be referred to the Privileges Committee to deal with and perhaps make some appropriate ruling against Thales's CEO. I know the CEO; he's a nice chap. But perhaps a night or two in the cell in our basement—Annabel Crabb tells me there's one somewhere—will deter a repeat of a breach from them and from others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the broader context, the actions of the British parliament in the Facebook case show that the Australian parliament is now lagging behind when it comes to establishing its authority, and this is the fault of each and every senator in this place. We must not exercise power irresponsibly, but we must also recognise that there are circumstances where it is irresponsible not to exercise a power.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Share This! campaign by the Alannah &amp; Madeleine Foundation and the Supre Foundation. I acknowledge that this speech was largely developed by a participant in the Girls Take Over Parliament program who spent the day in my office. The program gives young women the opportunity to shadow politicians and experience parliamentary life firsthand. Mariam, our participant, is a student at the ANU and has been involved in the program because she wishes to encourage greater diversity and representation in Australian politics and encourage young women to be politically active.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Share This! campaign surrounds the issue of image based bullying, a prevalent issue in today's digital society. The campaign focuses on examining and explaining the concept of image based abuse, consent and the laws surrounding this issue. This is of utmost importance, as young people tend to be unaware of the laws that protect them with regard to this issue and tend not to seek justice or help if they become a target of image based bullying. In fact, the Share This! campaign has stated that 76 per cent of Australians who have experienced image based abuse did not pursue further action. Often discussions of such incidents focus on blaming victims rather than those who have committed the image based abuse by taking or sharing images without consent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bullying clearly has adverse effects on the mental health of victims, and image based abuse is no exception. Not only should individuals be more informed of their rights under the law; they should also be aware of the services available to them with regard to mental health. Certainly, in the school setting, school counsellors should be well informed of these issues and how they affect young people. It is important that those who are offering mental health services to victims of image based abuse understand the effects of these issues on the people they are treating so that individuals have access to the help they need. Institutional changes with regard to education and mental health care as well as social changes are necessary to combat this issue. In order to prevent instances of image based abuse and broader issues of sexual violence, consent is a concept that should be widely understood and codified as an integral part of the education of young people. Mental health care for victims should be followed up after incidents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Share This! campaign initiates a social change that encourages young people to be aware of this issue and, more importantly, encourages a better understanding of the concept of consent. We can all be part of this social change by participating in productive discussions about these extremely important issues.</span>
