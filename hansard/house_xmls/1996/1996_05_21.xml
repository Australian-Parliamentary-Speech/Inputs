I refer the minister to his reported comments on ABC radio of March 13 this year, which were that Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek needed to be `up and running as quickly as possible because that will further help reduce the noise problem of Sydneysiders'. Can he guarantee that his decision announced today to consider Holsworthy as an alternative site will not substantially delay construction of Sydney West airport?

        It is worth noting—and honourable members need to note this—that the previous government put all of its eggs into the one basket over Badgerys Creek. Indeed, it initiated an environmental impact study in January of this year. Had that proceeded, it could have raised the possibility that Badgerys Creek was an unacceptable site for an airport from an environmental point of view. Had that been the case, and with all your eggs invested in the one basket, it would have meant further delay to the construction of a second airport for Sydney. Our actions are designed to guarantee that, if an environmental impact study on Badgerys Creek proves a negative outcome from an environmental point of

        The one thing the people of Sydney are sick and tired of is further delay in constructing a second airport for Sydney. The reason they are concerned is that the delay in the construction of a second airport for Sydney further imposes more unnecessary aircraft noise over their heads. Our decision today is designed to give us a fallback position in case that environmental impact study provides us with an environmentally unacceptable outcome.

        Can I reiterate to the House that it is this government's first priority to develop an airport at Badgerys Creek. We are determined to proceed with a second airport for Sydney. Our first priority is Badgerys Creek. This will minimise any further delay in the settlement of that outcome.

        The government will shortly circulate a discussion paper that contains a number of options. Those options will not include a proposal through legislation to extinguish native title. The options will, however, include a number of proposals to address the unworkable features of the Native Title Act. One of the greatest and most legitimate complaints that I have heard from people in the mining industry and the pastoral industry is the proliferation of the practice whereby unsubstantial and vexatious claims are made across wide areas of land which have the effect of gumming up any prospect of early development. Because of the construction of the existing act, those claims trigger the right to negotiate principles under the existing legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the options that will be proposed will result in a significant curtailment of the right to negotiate procedures under the existing legislation. I might remind the House that the right to negotiate procedures was not mandated by the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mabo No. 2 v. the State of Queensland, and the right to negotiate procedures of the existing act is unknown to other forms of common law title that exist in Australia.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The notion that any option to propose a more stringent approach to the right to negotiate would be taking a right away from native title holders which has not been taken away from the holders of other common law titles in Australia would not be a valid argument.

        This is a very difficult issue and there are strongly held opinions right across the political spectrum. I dare say there are people in the Labor Party who feel uneasy about the existing Native Title Act; there are certainly a lot of people in the coalition parties who believe it must be amended to make it more workable. And in proposing the options that we do propose we are responding to the concerns of pastoralists and the mining industry. We recognise that the economic future of this country depends on resource
        <break page="920" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         development and upon getting a set of laws which do not allow people who do not have substantial claims to stall development for years.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The complaints that are legitimately made about the present Native Title Act are that it is so widely cast, so cumbersome in its procedures and has so added to the original intent of the Mabo decision that it is being used by some in the community as an instrument to obstruct and delay legitimate development in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is something that must be addressed. We are going to try to address it in a way which respects the principles of the act and respects the survival of native title as decreed by the High Court of Australia in its decision but which does not give to the putative claimants of native title rights to obstruct, delay and obfuscate that are not available to the putative claimants of other common law titles throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would have thought that that is a very effective way of responding to a difficult issue. The discussion paper we are putting out obviously is what it is called—a discussion paper. It indicates the disposition of the government at present. We invite people who are interested—including state governments and others in the community—to respond, and I hope that the legislation which follows from that process is legislation that can enjoy the support of the entire House.

        In addition, the honourable gentleman raises the question of a curfew for Sydney airport. It is worth while reminding the House that the person who introduced legislation into this chamber to enforce that curfew through legislation is the now Prime Minister of Australia. Through that bill and the pressure that it imposed on the parliament, the Prime Minister gave to the people of Sydney—for the very first time—a guarantee through legislation that their curfew would be in place through the legislative process. I can answer the question proposed by the honourable gentleman by saying yes, the cap for aircraft movements will remain, as our commitment stated it would, and indeed the legislation surrounding the curfew and the consequences of that legislation will remain.

        The environmental impact studies that were done in 1985, which the honourable gentleman referred to in his question, highlighted a number of factors.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. What are the implications for the future sound management of the economy of failing to deal with the $8 billion `poisoned chalice', the $8 billion budget black hole, left to this government by Labor? Would the government ever consider as a deliberate policy choice at a time of sustained economic growth, ignoring the opportunity to eliminate the budget deficit?

        That was the answer given by the shadow Treasurer, that the deficit is a product of deliberate policy choice. The people of Australia would like to know whether the foreign debt which blew out under Labor from $23 billion to $185 billion was a product of deliberate policy choice. What we have inherited is the responsibility to clear that deficit. That is why the Australian people put us in government, to make sure that we take the pressure off interest rates, give small business a chance to increase growth in employment, and give the economy a chance to grow. That is why Labor was thrown out.

        I was concerned—I have not heard any confirmation of this report—to read a report this morning that suggested that the Democrats' view was that the bill was such a massive overhaul of industrial relations there was no chance of having it passed by the government's 30 June deadline. The truth is that the bill is a fair articulation of that which we took to the last election. It is a fair statement of the policy which we have presented. It would be a breach of our responsibility if we did not impress upon the Senate that the Australian people have supported this legislation. They have called on us to proceed apace with this legislation, within reason. We have done so. We look forward to its reasonable passage through the Senate in due course.

         One of the problems under the last government was that they were not prepared to make the changes to allow Australians to get on and meet the challenges of that very change. In fact, it is our policy to make a series of changes to the commission. In some respects we are actually enhancing the role of the commission. Take awards, for example: we want awards to be simplified, but we also want them to be a genuine protection for people. If there is a breach of an award under proposals in the government's policy, we will increase the penalties for breaching awards. Those penalties have not changed for 20 years and we are going to bring them up to play a fair role.

          I put it to members opposite that they should also reflect on the fact that the claim by the ACTU that it views the commission as an independent umpire is nonsense. The truth of the matter is that in Australian industrial relations for many years the unions only supported the role of the commission in so far as it supported the privileges of unions. That is not supporting the commission as an independent umpire. That is simply supporting their own vested interest. Unions have regularly defied the decisions of the commission when they disagreed with them. The Novacoal dispute, which has been in the press recently, is the latest case in point.

        The government's commitment to abolish the Labor Party's new schools policy is one of our longest standing policy commitments. The government believes that parents should be able to exercise freedom of choice in the school to which they send their children, whether that school is in the government or the non&amp;hyphen;government sector. Furthermore, the government acknowledges that there is a public benefit in the education of all children and that it is therefore appropriate for public funding to be made available, regardless of the parents' choice.

         The new schools policy was established by the former government in 1985 to restrict parents in the exercise of their choice. It was called at the time the `no new schools' policy, and there are several things that I want to say to the House about this policy. Firstly, it failed in its principal object. In the 15 years between 1970 and 1985, before Labor introduced the new schools policy, the percentage of students in non&amp;hyphen;government schools increased from 22 per cent to 25.8 per cent. In the 10 years of the new schools policy, from 1986 to 1996, the percentage increased from 26.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent, a faster rate of increase than before the policy was established.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far as can be determined, therefore, the policy has affected this trend, if at all, only at the margins. But there is little doubt, firstly, that it has pushed up fees for those parents least able to afford them and it has therefore operated in a socially inequitable manner. Secondly, the policy has imposed a huge bureaucratic set of arrangements which have caused frustrations and costly delays of up to two years or more for parents wishing to establish new schools. Other community agencies and churches have been equally frustrated by these bureaucratic restrictions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are now in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs eight people whose role it is to administer the policy. They service committees in states and territories that also involve people from state government and non&amp;hyphen;government school organisations. They sit down for one month of every year, trying to prioritise the applications that have come before the committees. It is red tape and duplication of the states' services gone mad, and all because some parents want to exercise their freedom of choice for their children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us be clear about this: it costs the taxpayer less when a child is educated in a non&amp;hyphen;government school. I have been advised that the estimate is a saving to state budgets of an average of $1,800 per child.

         Let me be quite clear on this point: the government has no policy about the appropriate size of the government and non&amp;hyphen;government school sectors. I want to remind all members of this House of the government's commitment to quality government school sectors. The distinction between the two sectors is perhaps becoming less important as time goes by, but the relative size of the two sectors is determined by the choices that parents make and the financial incentives that exist for parents to select a government school.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The principle of freedom of choice is increasingly recognised in all sectors as an important accountability principle, and it is being pursued now by a number of state governments within the government school systems. The government's policy will open up desirable, largely low&amp;hyphen;fee options for lower income parents. I understand that the Anglican church is keen to move into this area of school provision.

         —This Prime Minister is the person who is active in law and order. Have you forgotten about that? In regard to the process of Customs and the importation of illegal substances and narcotics, Customs are always mindful of targeting those areas. With the enormous number of movements—not only barrier but also shipping movements—in remote ports around Australia, Customs must target not only the ships and their destination but also the make&amp;hyphen;up of the crew in a risk analysis for those areas. We intend to continue and step up that process. That process will not be compromised by any efficiency dividends gained out of Customs.

         on 16 February this year, in an article titled `Liberals look at making Badgerys main airport', it was made plain that the Liberal Party was committed not only to building Badgerys but also to making it the No. 1 airport in the Sydney region.

        For a few weeks after the election we had broadly a similar line emerging from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and other members of the government. On ABC radio on 13 March the minister stated:

        We want to build a second Sydney airport, we want to build one that is capable of handling all international aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also stated:
       </para>
       <break page="934" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The challenge for us is to minimise the impact of noise and to spread that noise impact more equitably and that's what we're trying to do by the reopening of the East-West runway, the selection of new flight paths, and obviously trying to get Sydney West Airport constructed in Badgerys Creek.
        </para>
        <para>
         I specifically draw the House's attention to those last words in that quote. Subsequently, in the same interview, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development stated that, with respect to the government's commitment to Badgerys Creek, they were committed to `getting Sydney West airport up and running as quickly as we can'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far so good. Up until that stage it appeared that the government was sticking to the commitment to Badgerys Creek that had been established by the previous government and which it had stated numerous times prior to the election that it was going to maintain. Then things started to get a bit murky. Then we had a little speculation floating up about Goulburn—very fast trains that just happened to be in the minister's electorate. It was 200 kilometres from Sydney; nonetheless, it was a serious possibility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then there were a few hints about Newcastle and that maybe that would be a good place to have a second airport for Sydney. Then there were one or two rumours about Holsworthy, and the true agenda started to float to the surface. Yesterday on 2UE Alan Jones, in an interview with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         So therefore the delay caused by the new environmental impact statement could be a good thing which enables you, particularly, to take a realistic view of all the social costs and perhaps knock the thing on the head?
        </para>
        <para>
         The `thing' of course was the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. The minister's response was, `That certainly could be the case, Alan.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the agenda starts to become clear. What was a clear, strong commitment on the part of the coalition prior to the election, and even for a few weeks after the election, suddenly gets a bit cloudy. Then we hear the litany of excuses gradually flowing from the minister as to why they have changed their position—`The runways are too short. There is not
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          enough capacity for the proposed Badgerys Creek airport. It is not flat.' What a surprise! I think the term was `rugged terrain' or `undulating terrain'. He said that it will require a fair amount of cut and fill works. I would be surprised if there were too many places near Sydney that would not require cut and fill works to construct an airport. Apparently that is a major problem at Badgerys. He also said, `There are access problems. You need road and rail links. They have to be constructed. That is costly. There are other cost issues involved. There are problems with the prospective flight paths.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is hardly surprising, in the wake of this litany of problems the minister was putting forward, that Mr Jones concluded at the end of the program that there will be no airport built at Badgerys Creek. Maybe the minister got cut off at that point, but it was noticeable in the transcript that there was no response from the minister to that concluding statement by Mr Jones.

         We know that the National Party can be a bit amateurish at times. They have been out of government for a fair while and they occasionally have cowboy type people in some important positions. But it defies credibility to suggest that the minister was unaware, until the last few days, of these aspects of the proposed development at Badgerys Creek—that he did not know these sorts of things were problems and that obstacles had to be overcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When he gave his interview on ABC radio on 13 March, there was no mention of these sorts of problems. None of these obstacles was dealt with. It was full steam ahead: `Badgerys Creek, we're committed. The former government were wimps. The former government were only half&amp;hyphen;hearted about it. They weren't really serious. They wanted only a little one. We want a fully&amp;hyphen;fledged second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek.'

         He knew at that stage about the obstacles involved with building Badgerys Creek. He knew about the need for road and rail development. He knew about the cost. He knew that there would be a bit of earthmoving required. So why was he so committed a couple of months ago and why is he now backing away? The story seems to change about every half an hour. He is now using the term `fall back'. He wants Holsworthy as a fall back option. I do not think he used that term in his press conference today. It will be interesting to see whether it is in there.

          He wants Holsworthy as a fall back option. This is in spite of the fact that, when the Labor government examined all the options which led to the choice of Badgerys Creek over 10 years ago, Holsworthy finished second last out of 10 options. It did not even make the cut. He wants Holsworthy as a fall back option, in spite of the environmental problems associated there and the fact that the terrain at Holsworthy is even more rugged than the terrain at Badgerys Creek. It is full of ravines and gorges. In spite of the exist ence of numerous unexploded bombs on the site, Holsworthy is going to be the fall back option.

         Did the minister or anybody else in the coalition mention prior to the election anything of this to voters in electorates like Hughes? Did any of those voters know that part of the prospect of electing a coalition government might involve this? No, they did not. I can suggest a few serious reasons why this is happening.

         The first is money for budget cuts. It was calculated that Badgerys would cost $83 million in 1996-97 and $73 million in 1997-98. So here is a bit of money those opposite can get by not having to spend it on the Badgerys proposal and slowing everything down on every other front. Secondly, it sends the second airport for Sydney off into the never-never. They can still pretend that they are committed to doing it and going ahead with it by saying to the people around KSA, `Don't worry. We're looking after you. We're going to build Sydney's second airport but just not quite yet.' Thirdly, they are letting the real agenda come through, which is basically to expand Kingsford Smith airport, to get rid of the curfew, to get rid of the cap and to have no second airport.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very significant that yesterday two people from absolute opposite ends of the spectrum on these issues, Chris Brown from the Tourism Task Force, which does not want Badgerys built, and the New South Wales Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Mr Knowles, both agreed that this meant that there would be no second airport for Sydney. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are likely to have a Lindsay by-election in the near future or the fact that Badgerys Creek is now surrounded by a number of marginal Liberal electorates and there are more safe Labor electorates around Holsworthy. Perhaps there are a few little political whiffs in there as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we consider what has happened with respect to Kingsford Smith and the fact that Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party policy with respect to Kingsford Smith was essentially based on the need to get aircraft away from Bennelong and to give them some chance of winning Lowe,
         <break page="936" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          perhaps we should not be too surprised. Perhaps we should not be too surprised that policy is being developed based on putting the airport where it largely affects only safe Labor seats—maybe Hughes but mostly safe Labor seats—and making sure they hang onto seats like Macarthur, Lindsay and the rest.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The real agenda is to keep putting off the second airport, let pressure from the Olympics gradually build up and put the government in a position where it has no choice but to get rid of the cap and the curfew at Kingsford Smith airport. The political pressure from within the community to make sure that the Olympics are successful and that we do not have transport chaos, including with the airlines, at that time will be considerable. So the minister and the government are setting up a situation where ultimately the people who live near Kingsford Smith airport will suffer substantially as a result of these decisions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The strategy is pretty straightforward. First, you cast a bit of doubt on Badgerys by saying, `Oh, no. There's all these obstacles. There's all these problems. It's pretty hard and it's very expensive.' Then suddenly the estimates of how much it is going to cost start multiplying. None of this was there before the election, of course. Then you float Goulburn, then you float Newcastle, then you suddenly insert Holsworthy, which did not pass the cut 10 or 12 years ago, and you slow things down a bit more. Maybe they will eventually get to Dubbo. There is still a chance. Dubbo is in there with a show of being the second airport for Sydney.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consequences of this backflip are, first, that the last hope of having a second airport for the Olympics has gone. The Liberals half killed it by stopping the funding through the Senate when they stopped the sale of airport leases in the Senate which was needed to fund Badgerys. Second, the retention of the cap and the curfew is now under serious threat. The minister has told us he wants to share the pain at Kingsford Smith airport. Now we know why—there is going to be a lot more pain to go around. The potential jobs in western Sydney from a second airport are
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          now under threat. Road developments that link different parts of Sydney will be abandoned. The sale of the lease at Kingsford Smith airport has been thrown into further confusion because that will be put back again.

         The minister cannot even seem to get his head around when the decision is going to be. Yesterday he told Alan Jones that he will make a decision in a few weeks time. His representative said in this morning's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         that it would be within 12 months of the Badgerys' EIS. We are told today that there will be a decision after competing EISs and a comparative study. When the minister was asked in question time today whether there would be as a result of his decisions extra delay in the development of the second airport at Sydney west, he did not answer. All he said was, `We're committed to building a second airport as soon as possible.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We probably had better give the coalition, now in government as well as when they were opposition, some credit for consistency in aviation policy. They are consistently inconsistent, consistently hypocritical and consistently very confused. Labor was committed to building a second airport and had committed money to doing so. It had made that subject to an environmental impact statement in order to ensure that concerns with respect to noise, environmental factors and the like could be properly taken account of. Until the Liberals intervened through the Senate, we were on track to build such an airport in time for the Olympics and in time to make sure that Sydney will be able to cope with the massive influx of tourists that the Olympics will inevitably produce.

         Let us look at the Liberals in contrast. We all remember them in the late 1980s. Some of us were not in this place at the time, but in the late 1980s they were gung-ho advocates for the third runway, with John Howard leading the charge. When the government started to do something about it, they then changed their minds, saying, `Oh, no. This is terrible. This is going to produce all sorts of appalling consequences.' They were also gung-ho advocates for privatisation. They thought privatising airports was a great idea—
         <break page="937" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and privatising everything would be a great idea. But when the government started to do it and started to sell leases to the airports what did the Liberals do? They blocked that in the Senate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then we had a situation where they supported building a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek to take the pressure off Kingsford Smith airport and to make sure that people in the inner suburbs have a reasonable lifestyle. But, now that they are in government and they have a chance to do something about it, what do they do? They back away, obfuscate, put things off.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that the government are not committed to building a second airport for Sydney. They do not want to spend the money. They do not care about the residents around Sydney airport. They do not want to confront the practical obstacles that are involved in getting a second airport up and running as quickly as possible. This latest device is a transparent device to ensure that they can let the whole issue just drag on for a few more years and that they will not have to spend much money. They will just chop and change here and there, slide around a little and wriggle out from underneath their commitments to avoid investing in new airport infrastructure for Sydney and get to a point where the impending Olympics will give them the excuse they want to wriggle out of their commitments to look after the people who are living with great difficulties around Kingsford Smith airport.

        It is very interesting to note that the subject we are discussing today—that is, the second airport for Sydney—has been the subject of discussion and debate in this House for nearly 30 years.

        In February 1986 the then government announced, following an EIS, that Badgerys Creek was the preferred site for a second airport for Sydney. It is interesting to note that at that time Badgerys Creek was not situated amongst a residential area, and the possible flight paths for an airport at Badgerys Creek would not have caused the occupants of houses under those paths the inconvenience and the aircraft noise that many of those people who live in the western parts of Sydney now endure.

In March 1989 they finally announced a staged development of Badgerys Creek and claimed that Badgerys Creek would be developed with a runway in operation by June 1995. So, after selecting the

All of that was due to take place on 10 March 1994. But that was cancelled. On 25 March another ceremony was organised for the initial cutting, and the minister dutifully appeared on top of a bulldozer to mark the beginning of the construction of the so&amp;hyphen;called Badgerys Creek airport.

The last announcement made by the Labor Party in May 1994 was an attempt by them to convince the people of Sydney that they were fast-tracking the airport and developing it to accommodate more than just the overflow capacity from Sydney's major airport at Mascot.

I can assure the House this afternoon that the new government is determined to build a second airport for Sydney as quickly as possible and that attempts by the Labor Party to paint our announcement today as another reason for delay are totally wrong—totally and utterly wrong.

Our insurance is a position whereby, if an environmental impact study to be undertaken on Badgerys Creek proves that it is environmentally unacceptable to build an airport there, we can move to an alternative site straightaway, without any further delay.

        If the Labor government were still in power today, the net consequence of that environmental impact study proving that Badgerys Creek was environmentally unacceptable would have resulted in further delays. As a consequence, we would have seen more inconvenience to people living in Sydney. This government is not causing delays; it is indeed taking out insurance against any delays as a consequence of an environmental impact study for Badgerys Creek. Our first preference, our first priority, our first order, is to develop Badgerys Creek. Within the possibility of Badgerys Creek being proven to be environmentally unacceptable, we will be able to move to an alternative site without further delay. For people to say that this is a delaying tactic is totally and utterly wrong because we are totally and utterly determined to develop an airport—a second airport for Sydney—as quickly as possible.

         There has been a matter raised by the honourable member for Melbourne, in his address to the House this afternoon, in relation to the possibility of expanding Sydney airport. Indeed, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) also questioned whether we will lift the cap on aircraft movements per hour at Sydney's Mascot airport because of the impending Olympic Games. Can I say to the House today that we are committed to the maintenance of that 80 aircraft movements per hour at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. We are as committed today as we were in opposition. We are also committed to the curfews that were initiated as a consequence of John Howard's private member's legislation that was moved last year by him and which instilled that curfew in legislation.

We also said that we would have a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem over Sydney if we were elected to office. That is precisely what we have done.

        The first delay in the construction of Badgerys Creek was the need to upgrade the airport from a regional runway of 1,800 metres to a fully international runway of 2,900 metres. The Labor government saw the need to do that to cope with the obvious demand that will come.

        The second delay occurred because the then opposition knocked over the funding base for Badgerys Creek with the rejection of the airport privatisation legislation.

It is false in the extreme to say that the former government dragged the chain on those developments.

        The government wants to derail a second Sydney airport by speculating on a second alternative. That is all it is, it is no more than speculation. As I stand here today on 21 May 1996, I state: the government will never go ahead with Badgerys Creek and it will never go ahead with an airport at Holsworthy. They are just false promises. The second site has been examined up hill and down dale and rejected unequivocally. As sure as night follows day, the government's deliberate delaying tactics will blow out the noise curfew and capping on hourly flight movements that exist at Kingsford Smith.

        This is more so given the government's arrogant and irrational decision to reopen the east&amp;hyphen;west runway at KSA which was referred to by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the concluding parts of his speech. It is irrational because it significantly decreases the capacity of KSA. While the east&amp;hyphen;west runway is operational, the north&amp;hyphen;south runways are virtually closed. The north&amp;hyphen;south parallel runways have a capacity of between 70 and 80 movements an hour. The east&amp;hyphen;west runway has a safe capacity of approximately 20 movements an hour.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The figures speak for themselves. The reduction in capacity caused by the operation of the east&amp;hyphen;west runway is acknowledged by the fact that the government can only use the east&amp;hyphen;west runway during non&amp;hyphen;peak periods. That is, it is putting planes over the homes of school children when our kids are trying to learn. And, again, when the kids come home of an evening, when parents are trying to put them to bed, the government has planes flying over our homes.

         By the year 2000 there will be 20 million passengers coming into Sydney airport and it simply does not have the capacity to handle it. So the curfew will be broken and there will be an increase in aircraft movements and a return to the simultaneous operation of cross&amp;hyphen;runways. The simultaneous operation of cross&amp;hyphen;runways has been universally acknowledged as significantly less safe than parallel runways. Between 1991 and 1993 there were five serious incidents involving aircraft at Kings ford Smith airport.

         —In the short time remaining to me, as my speech was cut short last night when the debate was adjourned, I wish to say something about the matter of the gun laws in this country, which has created a great deal of controversy. Someone remarked to me that, with 800,000 people unemployed and overseas debt running at over $180 billion net, there are more important things to be speaking about. But it has caused a great deal of emotion.

        In saying that, I do not want to diminish the great horror and dismay which we all experienced with regard to the Port Arthur massacre which took place not so long ago. In particular, I wish to commend the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has shown great leadership on this issue, as have the police ministers from all the states and territories and from all major political parties. They have behaved extremely well and in response to the desires of the Australian people. Most opinion polls show about 90 per cent of people in support and about six to eight per cent opposing what was done, with two to four per cent undecided.

        I know there is going to be provision for farmers and professional shooters—under certain stringent circumstances—to be able to use these weapons, but I have a particular concern about sporting shooters.

        The sporting shooters—apart from a few rednecks at meetings up in Queensland whom we have seen on our television screens recently—are responsible citizens of the highest order and are very safety conscious indeed; they have always been this way.

        Some time ago there was an incident on their range at Dubbo when, after the clay pigeon box was emptied, the wind caught the box and swept it across the range. Someone fired a shot into the box and was immediately ordered off the range. That is how strong a priority they put on safety. No animals or birds can be shot on ranges, and birds get to know this of course and fly around these ranges as they do anywhere else.

        These people also instruct children on safety measures.

Those groups probably went bashing down his door and he has decided to pass the buck. He won out, and now the member for Hughes is going to have to suffer for it.

        As far as Badgerys Creek is going, I hate to say to the minister but I will say: I told you so. Since Badgerys Creek was first selected as the site for the second Sydney airport, I have viewed its impending development with a very jaundiced eye. Since coming into this House in 1990, I have used my
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         speaking times repeatedly to question the wisdom of our then government in planning an airport at that particular location, and I have repeatedly lobbied my ministers to this effect. I have no problem in admitting that at times I became, not a thorn in the side, but perhaps a stone in the shoe of both the former Minister for Transport and the former minister for the environment. I certainly did chew their respective ears off as to the dangers of Badgerys Creek and why we should look elsewhere for a suitable site for a second airport.

        In recent times my fight has been supported by various people within my own community. I am sure this House is aware that the political fights surrounding airports are not usually pretty ones, nor are they clean. I am sure that the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), one of my colleagues who is here at the moment, would certainly support me when I say that different people certainly become emotionally involved when we talk about airports, particularly when the aeroplanes are flying over their own homes.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Certainly one of the more vocal groups in my community is the Fairfield Residents Against Airport Noise, or FRAAN, as it is more popularly known. As someone who personally has always been against the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek, I initially viewed FRAAN, upon its inception in July of last year—take note, it formed only last July—as a genuine outpouring of community feeling. I saw it as a group of concerned individuals, independent of political beliefs, asking questions and raising issues about Badgerys Creek for the common good.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This view has certainly changed somewhat over the past 10 months, especially as various leaders in the group have attempted to smear my name by saying that I was always for the airport and that I was actively participating in the supposed deception of the community over the former government's plans for Sydney West airport. However, to this day, I recognise that there are still members of FRAAN who maintain the community-minded intentions with which the group first began. I offer them my continued support and I thank them for the encouragement that they, in turn, have given to me.

         Before the election I had the great pleasure of making representations on behalf of a number of people, both within my electorate and outside, who suggested alternative and far superior sites for airport development. The question of Holsworthy was certainly only one of those from one constituent of mine, a Mr Alex Pope, who approached me at the very beginning of this year to make representation to the Environment Protection Agency on his behalf. I suppose he must have been very pleased this morning when he read about how that is now going to be given consideration.

         The other site about which I have also written to the respective authorities suggesting further investigation was Goulburn—and the minister well knows this. I had prepared myself for a long struggle ahead with the new government, particularly after the minister's initial statements, which were made once he had assumed the reins in his portfolio. Now I have been delivered this new news like manna from heaven.

         `What could have brought about this development?' I stopped to think this morning. I thought, `Is it sheer good sense?' which, I must say, is not entirely out of the question. Or is it perhaps the fact that Badgerys Creek is now circled by a number of new Liberal seats, including, as I stated earlier, the seat of the Minister for Finance? This cannot be discounted either—and, if you are a politician, you do not discount anything. I dare say that the minister has had time to reflect and, in doing so, perhaps even seen the error of his government's plans—not only to build at Badgerys Creek but to expand the airport to reach international size rather than let it remain as an overflow operation, as the previous government always intended.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Rather than continuing these two EISs, I say to the minister that Goulburn certainly seems to be coming more and more the attractive proposition as each day passes, particularly as references to the very fast train project have begun to increase exponentially in recent times. I would suggest to the minister that now is the perfect time for a reappraisal of the merits of locating Sydney's second airport at Goulburn. An airport at
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Goulburn could only increase the value of a very fast train operation. Conversely, it would only be through a very fast train link that such an airport could be made viable. If my memory serves me correctly—and having read that EIS over and over again I think it does—Goulburn was originally counted out of the airport site selection process in the mid-1980s due to the fact that it would lie approximately 200 kilometres from the city it would primarily serve—that is, Sydney.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Doesn't a very fast train entering into the equation change things? Just as the minister has now told the House that technological advances have rendered the unexploded bombs at Holsworthy not a problem, can't the same be said with regard to the technological advances regarding rail travel? When we look at what speeds these trains can now reach and the short time it would take for them to cover those very long distances, it really does become awe inspiring—I think more than awe inspiring. The transportation possibilities raised by the very fast train actually negate the factors for which Goulburn was rejected as an airport site in the first place. With the very fast train rendering the argument of distance impotent, the positive aspects of Goulburn as the choice for Sydney's second airport site suddenly come into focus.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is the `people' factor for a start. There are many proponents of Badgerys Creek in Sydney—some of whom are in this parliament—who believe that the airport, once built, would be situated in some sort of isolated and empty country setting. While the rural nature of the site is not questioned, the fact that it is now fringed by some of Sydney's fastest growing housing developments is failing to loom large enough in people's minds.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="949" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          It is estimated that only 1,500 people would be directly affected by Badgerys Creek. I would personally wager that many thousands more will be affected. The construction of an airport at Goulburn, on the other hand, would affect less than 100 people. It may pose a concern to sheep and cattle! We may have to investigate those concerns. We are not paying close enough attention to the fact that beyond the fringe there are the more heavily populat ed areas of the greater western suburbs of Sydney, which are growing at the moment at an incredibly fast pace. Goulburn has none of these population worries.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To my mind, population worries also count against Holsworthy as a site for the airport. Much has been said in the papers this morning about those vast tracts of national park that surround the proposed Holsworthy airport site. I am sure the members for Cook (Mr Mutch), Hughes and Fowler (Mr Grace)—and I know the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has expressed his concerns—would certainly have things to say about the effect on the homes and lifestyles of their constituents. I know that, as concerned members of parliament, they would be concerned that the lifestyles of their constituents would be affected by airport noise should Holsworthy ever be built.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are no longer a small isolated state. No matter where the second airport goes, it must have 24&amp;hyphen;hour operation. This is not feasible and not possible at Badgerys Creek. It certainly would not be possible at Holsworthy. I do not believe that we should even contemplate having an airport that operates 24 hours a day anywhere near a large congregation of residents. To build another airport in this state without that capacity is foolish indeed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Situated as it is, far from even the slightest suggestion of urban sprawl, Goulburn would have the least environmental impact of any of the sites so far considered for the airport. As the airport grew there would be no danger of it encroaching on the lives of thousands upon thousands of people, nor would there be any problems with it operating on a 24&amp;hyphen;hour basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are also other less obvious problems associated with Badgerys Creek. For example, there is no evidence of the Goulburn site ever having been used as an ancient Aboriginal settlement. Such evidence has recently been uncovered at Badgerys Creek. The Holsworthy site has been recognised and documented as including 23 Aboriginal archaeological sites.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think we also have to remember that Holsworthy, like Badgerys Creek, is also situated well within the Sydney basin. The concerns that we have had in south&amp;hyphen;western
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Sydney regarding the smog and air pollution that would be an unavoidable spin-off from Badgerys Creek are still relevant when looking at Holsworthy.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Goulburn has none of these problems. When looked at in conjunction with the very fast train service, these are the positives which I believe we should now be considering. In relation to the very fast train, Australia is at the moment inadvertently well placed to reap the benefits from the amazing advances that have taken place in the area of rail travel.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are two types of very fast train available to us now. One has been put forward by the company Speedrail, which advocates the use of a train modelled on the French designed TGV. It reaches speeds of up to 300 kilometres an hour. The TGV, believe it or not, is not actually now at the forefront of fast rail technology. That honour goes to a train called Transrapid, otherwise known as Maglev.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Maglev forgoes the traditional `wheel on steel' approach to rail travel in favour of a carriage which sits above the tracks thanks to magnetic levitation. I know that it sounds like something that H.G. Wells would have come up with some 100 years ago, but a Maglev train will actually go into operation between Berlin and Hamburg in 1998. It will reach speeds of 580 kilometres per hour. Looking at the opportunities a train such as the Maglev carries with it, Australia, having delayed taking up the very fast option until now, has a chance to actually step in at the top end of the queue of rail technology.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If it is estimated that the TGV would take approximately one hour to reach Goulburn on its way to Canberra, then we could expect the Maglev to take a much shorter time than that—in fact, it is estimated that it would take less than 45 minutes with stops. That is less time than it takes to travel by Sydney rail from Central Station to my electorate in Fairfield, which is in the western suburbs, let alone going on another 15 to 30 minutes to Badgerys Creek.

Of course we would encounter problems with the site. There would have to be a great deal of consultation with the people of Goulburn—a point I am sure the minister for transport would strongly agree with, considering the area is included within his own electorate. However, subject to the hurdle of gaining approval for the high&amp;hyphen;speed rail link, any problems associated with Goulburn, I am confident, would be far more easily overcome than those linked with Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. Building an airport at Badgerys Creek may have made sense 10 or 15 years ago. Now it continues to do so less and less as every young family chooses to make south&amp;hyphen;western Sydney their home.

By that time we will look back and question our judgment as to why Badgerys Creek was ever considered. I hope we will not have to kick ourselves and ask how we were stupid enough to actually let it be built there.

          I believe the minister must weigh up the pros and cons. I think you will see, Mr Deputy Speaker—as would the government if they would take their blinkers off—that Badgerys Creek is not necessarily the answer to the Sydney airport problems. I do not believe Holsworthy is either, for the reasons I have submitted in the very short time that I have had here today—bearing in mind that we only heard something like 18 hours ago about this wonderful gesture on behalf of the minister to run two concurrent EISs, much to the amazement, I am sure, of all the population in that area who are now going to be subjected to that. Certainly, it was never a commitment given by the now government during their campaign.

It was commenced in such a way that we will have ongoing consultation on water and land, and on flight paths. This was a guarantee supplied to us by the then bureaucrats from the EPA and the transport departments at public meetings attended by many people, not just myself.

Keep your two, if you want them. One is already started; one you are about to commence. At least have commonsense and take the blinkers off. Look at the feasibilities of where an airport for the future residents of this country should be built and also look at the probabilities of providing a fast rail transport. Get those trucks off the roads. Get immediate transportation from the airport to the very fast trains and let us, for once, see vision when we start thinking about airports for the future.'

        If representing an electorate in federal parliament were not in itself a great responsibility, I find myself humbled by the memory of the man whose name appears on the window on my electorate office. As we approach the centenary of Federation I cannot help but think of what it must have been like to be there—to be at the birth of a nation. I think of how Alfred Deakin anticipated so many of Federation's potential difficulties, yet continued to fight for a constitution that will bring us together.

        A Federal constitution is the last and final product of political intellect and constructed ingenuity; it represents the highest development of the possibilities of self&amp;hyphen;government of peoples scattered over a large area.

        I cannot help but think that, were Alfred Deakin able to stroll down the Maroondah Highway and through the streets of the electorate which today bears his name, he would be quite proud of our nation. However, he would also be aware of a community still in need of political action. He would realise that this is not a postcard federal seat. We have no Blue Mountains, Barrier Reef or Opera House. Our monuments are the 111,000 people who live in Deakin's sprawling suburbs, whose existence is not always glamorous and exciting but is often dignified and meaningful.

        Some people in my electorate are descendants of the very first Australians, those who lived here 40,000 years ago. Others are related to those who fought for our nation in more recent times, while others have lived in Deakin for less than a generation. Deakin's population is ageing. Those over 55 years of age now represent over 30 per cent of the population. This reality brings with it new demands on our infrastructure. It means that the demand for government assistance will increase rather than diminish. The chronic shortage of nursing home beds, the plight of our home carers and the continuing need for health services for the aged were some of the issues on which my election campaign was fought. These were the issues highlighted by the Gregory report, yet neglected by Labor.

        Families with young children are also making their presence felt in Deakin, particularly in the outer&amp;hyphen;east growth areas.

As the coalition's policy for families states, `A loving, supportive and stable family environment is the best and most enduring system of social support.' Therefore, government policy must be directed at strengthening families.

Fifty&amp;hyphen;eight per cent of all finished goods in the area are moving northward along the Hume Highway.

         Having worked with the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed under one of the myriad of Labor market programs offered through DEET, I am fully aware of what has and has not been done to help the unemployed find work. I was dismayed to discover that many programs do little more than create a false and cruel expectation in the eyes of recipients that they will find work. On Friday I attended the graduation ceremony of four young people from the local landcare and environment action program. After 26 weeks of hard work, they had acquired skills in environmental management and had made a stand against environmental degradation. But after the ceremony one of the parents took to the stage to urge CES and DEET to offer training with a purpose, to find jobs and to train young Australians to get them. I believe that programs that prepare young people for real jobs need to be encouraged, but these programs are pointless unless jobs are created for people to go to. Despite the rhetoric of Working Nation, the Labor government failed to create real, meaningful, long&amp;hyphen;term jobs.

In its 58 years of life, the  seat has been represented by William Hutchinson, Francis Davis, Alan Jarman, John Saunderson, Julian Beale and Ken Aldred.

Unfortunately, it appears that his prophecy will be proven to be correct. Today we saw the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and John Sharp defend the situation whereby they will establish an EIS into the site at Holsworthy concurrently with the EIS into Badgerys Creek—the expanded EIS established under Labor.

        It appears that the member for Bennelong and the member for Hume are today's Burke and Wills. They are wandering around New South Wales looking for a second airport site. They are looking for that elusive tree stump with the marking `Dig here for a second Sydney airport site'. If ever they find that stump, the member for Hume will turn to the member for Bennelong and say, `Well, what do you reckon about this for the site?' There is no doubt that the member for Bennelong will say, `Oh, not here. It's a bit close to Hunters Hill.'

        This delay shows a contempt for those residents currently living around the Sydney airport. We are seeing that political will, political courage, foresight and vision are needed to solve Sydney's airport problem. The new minister for transport showed today that he has none of that. We need to look at where Sydney West airport is at. This is not a new proposal. The EIS occurred a decade ago. Holsworthy was considered then and ran second last. Badgerys Creek was chosen as the most appropriate site for Sydney's second airport because it was by far and away the best site.

        It is not as though nothing has happened since then. Last year's budget allocations of the federal Labor government show that substantial progress has already been made: $306 million has already been allocated for airport development; $152 million has already been spent—not allocated but spent. All the

         land for Sydney West airport, including the 2,900&amp;hyphen;metre runway, has already been acquired. Some 1,770 hectares of freehold land have been compulsory acquired by the federal government in order to provide a solution to this problem.

        Already allocated is $21 million for the control tower and firefighting services, $23 million for environmental safeguards, $480 million for roads and $17 million to ensure that the rail corridor is reserved. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development spoke about the cost of this infrastructure, but in terms of its benefits it will not serve just the airport. What Labor had in mind was a visionary approach for a second Sydney airport, one which would not only solve Sydney's airport needs but also provide benefits. Labor intended to provide a ring&amp;hyphen;road which would finally connect the south&amp;hyphen;west of Sydney to the main western lines and main western freeways. That would have had massive employment benefits for the people of western Sydney.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor also wanted to make sure that we were not simply transferring the problem from Sydney airport to Sydney West airport. So we undertook to do a review and an update of the EIS, and that update was due to report. But it was not to be an EIS looking at alternative sites, because that process has already been done. With this decision today the coalition are essentially saying, `We'll turn the clock back 20 years and we'll once again start the whole process.' It is as though no money has been spent, no money has been allocated and no sites have been looked at up to this time.

        To find out the Liberals' real agenda, I refer to the comments of Chris Brown, who is on the Tourism Task Force. Yesterday he went on the John Stanley program on Radio 2UE in Sydney. When asked about their agenda, his response was pretty interesting. He said:

That committee did not operate along party lines; it operated in the interests of residents. There was only one vote in its one year of existence. It came up with a number of programs, such as the expansion of the acquisition zone in Sydenham and the increase in insulation, which were considered positively and agreed to by the federal government.

Because of the third runway, small businesses in Sydenham have had their living denied to them. Businesses are closing down, no-one is going into their stores, and there has been no word from this government about whether they will receive compensation. They have been told that they just have to wait.

        Preferential treatment has been taken a step further. During the election an announcement was made that no planes would go over the electorate of Lowe; the Bermuda Triangle was going to operate. The planes would take off from Kingsford Smith airport. They would hit the Iron Cove Bridge. They would not go right because they would hit the Sydney Harbour Bridge. They would not go straight ahead because we are against the Bennelong funnel and they would not go left because that was over the electorate of Lowe. They would just disappear into thin air. Perhaps the government's commitment to competition policy suggests that they are competing with the new ride at Seaworld in Queensland. That is what would have to happen.

        The supply bills must be passed by the parliament before 1 July this year to ensure the government has the funds to maintain its program delivery. Amongst other things, Supply Bill (No. 1) foreshadows the introduction of bills to replace the Audit Act 1901.

        The reform Audit Act was a hotly contested issue in the last parliament, members may recall, with the then Labor government being totally irresponsible in refusing to support amendments to increase the independence of the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, from the executive.

That judgment will have to be reserved for the time being.

         With a sensible commitment to resist new and eliminate existing duplication of service delivery functions between the federal government on one hand and the state and territory governments on the other, one can be forgiven for thinking that there is the promise of a new spirit of federalism in the air. But that feeling must be tempered by threats along the lines that, if designated federal taxpayers' funds are not used for purposes stipulated by the Commonwealth, it will nevertheless resort to tied grants or some other form of conditional funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let it be abundantly clear: the system of tied grants to states and territories is the biggest single catalyst for duplications of functions between the states and territories on the one hand and the Commonwealth on the other. Tied grants also limit the benefits which will accrue from the states and territories competing to attract investment in industry by restricting the breadth of incentives each government may, at its discretion, want to offer or match.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the score of Commonwealth funding for the states and territories, the government is justified in expecting the latter to accept a fair share of the pruning to be done to get the national government's budget back into surplus. But Labor has used funding cuts to make bunnies of the states and territories during its terms of office. While Labor's spending grew expeditiously, its states and territory funding was ruthlessly reduced.

         Small business figured large in the most recent general election. In Australia today, some would say—and I am inclined to subscribe to this view—that small business is truly at a crossroads. If the business community does not receive the attention it deserves from the Howard government, it will never receive a proper hearing. With so much to offer, the coalition should—and, I hope, will—do everything to improve the business environment so that our economy can grow as quickly and efficiently as possible. Even more importantly, we need growth to achieve more rapid employment creation. This is so important for so many Australians, particularly our young Australians.

         In pursuing a policy of freeing up small business, as has been promised by the government, one of the first targets should be serious attention to and reform of the fringe benefits tax. It is complicated and unnecessarily prescriptive. Fringe benefits tax legislation in New Zealand is only one&amp;hyphen;sixth the size of Australian legislation, yet on a per capita basis it nets the New Zealand government more revenue. Not only that, the cost of complying with the New Zealand fringe benefits tax is just over two per cent of total fringe benefits tax receipts in that country while in Australia conservative estimates place it at over 12 per cent. So the fringe benefits tax in Australia is an example of unnecessarily complex tax law.

         Reform of the industrial relations system is a definite requirement. It is needed to provide small businesses with a labour market system which encourages flexibility and increased productivity. Small businesses want to employ more people in the main, but when the system actively discourages this, such as with the unfair dismissal laws, they naturally avoid employing more staff.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, legislation reforming the industrial relations system should also benefit employees. The benefits of greater productivity and profitability will flow on to workers in the form of higher real wages. This is only fair. In providing small business with a conducive environment in which to operate, it is not enough for government to just provide a better tax system and a more flexible industrial relations system. The government also needs to create a macro&amp;hyphen;economic environment which is favourable. To that end, lower interest rates are an important factor. At the same time Australia needs to increase national savings and move to a net government sector surplus if interest rates are to be brought down to sustainably lower levels.

         We have heard much about slashing $8 billion from federal government outlays over the next two years.

         It is Australia's low rate of national savings that has been an issue and so much the subject of public discussion over the past few years—and especially so since the FitzGerald report. Australia's household saving rate is projected to account for only 2.8 per cent of disposable household income in 1996. The Netherlands, with 1.3 per cent, is the only OECD nation with a lower household saving rate. In fact, the majority of OECD countries have saving rates of over 10 per cent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia's household saving rate has not always been so low. In 1978 it was 11.2 per cent and it was about 14 per cent in the early 1970s. Although the level of household saving is expected to increase in the coming years because of compulsory superannuation and greater incentives to save, the real villain in Australia's shocking gross national savings record is the federal government's—and, to a lesser degree, the state governments'—poor fiscal policies. This was highlighted when the then Labor federal government in 1988 delivered a budget surplus and overall national savings increased to 22.4 per cent of GDP. In 1993, they slumped to 16.7 per cent.

          the Netherlands consistently has the lowest household saving rate in the OECD, because that country has an ongoing healthy balance of payments surplus it has maintained gross national savings figures which are consistently higher than the OECD average. In 1993, for example, the Netherlands achieved national savings of 23.3 per cent of GDP. If Australia is going to reverse its poor national savings record, it is obvious that the total government sector, both state and federal governments, needs to operate in surplus and households need further encouragement to save.

         —The Ships (Capital Grants) Act was passed by the former Labor government in 1987, arising from the maritime reform process which was initiated originally by a former National Party Minister for Transport, Mr Ralph Hunt, and which emerged from the deliberations of the Crawford committee.

        The act provided for the payment of a seven per cent bounty or grant to Australian owners of Australian registered ships that were at least 60 metres long and which had crew limits below 21 and, since 1989, below 18. The ships had to be either new or second&amp;hyphen;hand vessels that were under five years old and had previously not been Australian registered ships. There was a five&amp;hyphen;year sunset clause on the legislation and it was subsequently renewed by the parliament in 1992. It is again due to expire in 1997 as a result of the same sunset clause.

         The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996, put forward to the House by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), in effect amends the act by removing the word `1997' and replacing it with `1996' in order to terminate the grant immediately and, obviously, to not roll over the provisions in the legislation as had previously been the case. The former Labor government had announced that it was going to extend the act again for a further five years to ensure that the grant remained available to Australian shipowners, but clearly under the legislation as it is now proposed that grant will disappear.

         The legislation which we have before the House this evening also relates to the repeal of the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;Resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995, which was adopted by the parliament in response to the Ray Taylor report from SIRA, the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, and which also emerged out of discussions between the government, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Australian Shipowners Association in the latter part of 1994 with respect to the prospective sale of ANL.

         This piece of legislation provided that PAYE tax for crew members on vessels trading a majority of the time on international routes would be rebated to the owners of those vessels as a means of ensuring that the competitive gap between Australian shipping and foreign shipping, particularly flag of convenience shipping, was effectively reduced and, therefore, that Australian shipping had some basis on which it could compete with international competitors paying little, if any, tax. It is important to remember that this initiative was not the brainchild of the Maritime Union. It was supported by the Maritime Union of Australia, but it was largely the brainchild of the Australian Shipowners Association.

         As much as it may be derided by the minister and people on the other side, the initiative to rebate PAYE tax for Australian seafarers serving on vessels trading a majority of the time on international routes was in fact largely pushed by the shipowners, adopted by the government of the day and supported by
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the Maritime Union. It is also important to remember that the initiative involved the owners of the vessels, not the seafarers, getting the fiscal benefit. The seafarers retained the original take&amp;hyphen;home pay, but the tax that would otherwise have been paid to the government was retained by the owners. The bill simply repeals this legislation.

         The government has also announced that it is going to: repeal section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which provides for an accelerated depreciation regime of 20 per cent per annum for Australian ships; either abolish or alter—depending on when you listen to the minister or when you read the government's policy statements—the provisions for cabotage and introduce a second register, although there is some form of inquiry planned with respect to both of those propositions; and sell ANL to the highest bidder at the earliest opportunity, though the government will await some sort of report, which I understand is due at the end of the month, from the ANL board.

         There is also a question mark to complete the picture of the government's assault on the Australian maritime industry. There is a big question mark over $14.5 million of funding which had been budgeted for a world's best practice hydrodynamic testing facility that was planned for the Australian Maritime College at Launceston. The capital grants repeal legislation, supposedly, will save $12 million per annum for the government and the PAYE repeal bill will save $40 million over four years. However, it is important to remember that this is before tax. As both of those benefits were taxable, in the hands of the shipowners the amount that will be saved will be significantly less, particularly when you consider that most of the major shipowners would be paying company tax at a reasonably healthy rate.

          The government's intentions are clear. Firstly, a few more million dollars must be found for their Fightback agenda to cut the supposed budget deficit—the budget deficit crisis that they are creating as a guise for introducing a whole range of regressive social cuts. Secondly, there is a blind hatred for the Maritime Union of Australia and the Austral ian shipping industry based on the prejudice that comes from people such as the member for Corangamite who have been the users of these services. It is reflected in the fact that the minister has chosen to appoint Mr Greg Bondar, formerly Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, as his maritime adviser. The Australian Chamber of Shipping, in spite of its name, is basically the lobby group for foreign shipping in Australia. It is pretty extraordinary that the minister has chosen to appoint somebody from that background as his adviser, particularly when you consider that it has been stated that Mr Bondar will continue to provide, for some time, assistance and support to the chamber. It is roughly equivalent to the minister for primary industries appointing the European Community's commissioner for agriculture as adviser on primary industry. If it is shipping, nobody seems to care.

         Thirdly, with the perverted logic that seems to apply with the coalition, there is an attack on subsidies and regulations that apply to people other than their supporters.

         The opposition opposes this bill and will vote against it both here and in the Senate. The minister is still acting as if he were in opposition. There is no overall strategy for the Australian shipping industry. Companies and investors have been left in limbo. For example, the recently appointed new Chief Executive Officer of ANL, Roger Perkins, stated in response to this legislation:

         There has been considerable confusion about vital structures in the industry. On the one hand, the Liberal policy on cabotage was to abolish it and, on the other, the minister has said, no, there will be an inquiry. Then he said that the current single voyage permit arrangements would be extended and that the government would move over to something a bit like the New Zealand model.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

          With the second register, there was the same sort of response. The minister has announced an inquiry; the government has committed itself to introducing one. As for ANL, there have been all sorts of peculiar speculation about possibly selling it to Coles Myer or other potential buyers—a very strange suggestion.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been no examination of the effectiveness of the legislation that we are dealing with today, no attempt to look at the capital grants and the PAYE rebate to see whether they have, in fact, been beneficial to the industry and to the Australian community. There has been no consultation of any substance with affected parties, particularly the Maritime Union, until the last minute when the legislation was being introduced. There were no alternative industry assistance proposals being put forward. There was no real consideration of the merits of these initiatives at all. To the minister, they are just MUA rorts or Australian shippers with snouts in the trough.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We might well ask ourselves: who was it who actually initiated these sorts of assistance mechanisms? Who supported the capital grants legislation in 1987? The coalition. Who pushed the PAYE rebate? The shipowners—people such as BHP, Shell, Mobil, and others. There can be no doubt that this legislation will severely, and probably terminally, damage the Australian shipping industry. The Australian Shipowners Association estimates that it will increase the costs of Australian shipping by about 20 per cent.

         <para first-indent="16">
          International shipping is absolutely riddled with subsidies, tax avoidance and all sorts of arrangements designed to assist shipping industries of the particular countries. Twelve OECD countries have similar arrangements to our PAYE rebate. A number of OECD countries have accelerated depreciation allowances such as the one the minister proposes to abolish.

          These things have been acknowledged recently in a speech by Mr Bob Hutchinson, who is the chair of the National Bulk Commodities Group and, therefore, obviously no great strong supporter of the Australian shipping industry—in fact, somebody who
          <break page="965" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           would be likely to be critical of it. Mr Hutchinson has acknowledged the importance of these fiscal assistance measures because our competitors right throughout the world have the same sorts of things.

          Apelbaum Consulting figures that were provided to the Australian Shipowners Association comparing the cost structures of Australian shipping with other OECD countries and with the FOC countries indicate that, with these assistance mechanisms which are similar to the mechanisms that apply for other OECD countries, we are pretty competitive with other OECD nations. Also, we are only one or two million dollars per annum per vessel higher in average costs than flag of convenience vessels—and there are some other offsetting factors which tend to reduce that cost gap, like higher insurance costs for FOC vessels.

          That is not the Maritime Union of Australia speaking; it is BHP, one of the major Australian shippers that operates both on coastal runs and internationally. It is very clear that, without this assistance, the Australian shipping industry will suffer enormously and the pressure to shift business offshore to flag of convenience vessels and operators will be enormous.

           might advert to. Australia currently has approximately 13 ships engaged in international trade and about 17 which trade both internationally and on coastal routes.

          One of the significant things about the PAYE rebate, which is only just starting to evolve—because it is only a relatively recent initiative—is that it has created an incentive for companies with vessels that previously have plied only domestic routes to, in effect, double and split them up and use them half of the time on international routes. So there is already at least one example of a company buying another vessel and, rather than simply using one vessel on one domestic route, using each of two vessels for half of the year on the domestic routes and for the other half of the year exporting, in effect, shipping services by plying international routes into the South Pacific. That is only just starting with the PAYE tax rebate. It is an example of the things that will flow from this assistance structure if it is given time to operate.

          We have a huge shipping deficit in our current account, and that is something which will be substantially exacerbated by these measures.

I think it is worth asking ourselves the question: if such circumstances occur again, can we expect the same sort of contribution from vessels crewed by foreigners flagged in Liberia, Panama and the like? I think not.

          The proposals will mean that we have fewer trained seafarers. That obviously has implications for our defence preparedness, for our ability to administer safety and environmental maritime regulations. It means that our overall maritime skill pool, from which emerge numbers of people specialised in skilled occupations—such as harbour masters, investigative and safety personnel for organisations such as AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and various other state agencies—will be reduced. There will be less demand for certain types of specialised services which will exacerbate that problem.

          There will be adverse environmental consequences. One of the things that is probably not widely understood in the community is that bulk shipping is pretty much the most environmentally friendly form of transport. The cost base of shipping will shift upwards in Australia.

          We only need to look at a couple of figures on energy consumption to illustrate this point. Bulk shipping uses 0.2 megajoules of energy per tonne per kilometre compared with 0.4 for rail and 1.4 for trucks. In terms of greenhouse
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

          There will be less industry development. There are important spin&amp;hyphen;offs that emerge from the maritime industry in Australia—insurance, provedoring and supply of high&amp;hyphen;tech equipment. We do not build many large vessels in Australia anymore, but we do construct things like high&amp;hyphen;tech guidance systems and various other components that go into the vessels that are constructed. Obviously, if the demand for those vessels is shifted offshore then the potential for Australian companies, particularly in regional Australia, to develop economically is going to diminish significantly.

          It is instructive to look at Norway by comparison. Norway has less than one per cent of world trade—that is less than Australia. It has about 4&amp;half; million people, about 10 per cent of the world fleet and about 60,000 to 70,000 people employed in related industries such as ship broking, equipment, insurance, manufacturing and design.

There have been a thousand voluntary retirements and 1,500 seafarers retrained over the past 10 years. Since 1988, there have been 36 new or replacement vessels commissioned and the average age of vessels in the Australian fleet has gone down to 9.6 years which compares with the world average of 16.6 years.

The enterprise bargaining process is just starting to unfold with BHP, ANL and the other major companies. That process should be given the opportunity to work. There are issues still to be pursued, particularly with respect to matters such as maintenance at sea and a variety of other things. I have every confidence, provided the industry is allowed to operate and provided its existing support mechanisms are not taken away as this legislation proposes, that further major steps will be taken cooperatively between the Maritime Union of Australia and the major shipowners to improve further the productivity of our maritime fleet.

Shell is currently having a tanker constructed in Poland at the cost of approximately $53 million. The rebate was figured into the bottom line for that project—it was obviously worth several million dollars. The end result is that that has been taken away. BHP and Mackay Refined Sugars are in the same position. These three companies have made decisions based on this grant being in place for the forthcoming financial year. That is being removed retrospectively. Those on the other side of the House tend to get very hot under the collar about retrospectivity. Maybe it is a little bit selective.

As the example I cited before of a company moving to export shipping services as a result of the PAYE initiatives indicates, the suggestion that it is simply a windfall gain clearly has no basis in fact.

           The ironic thing about all this is that to a substantial degree we are talking about phantom savings here.

What is going to happen with the PAYE rebate? Are we still going to have a lot of Australian seafarers earning income from Australian shipowners and then paying the tax, so that the government actually gains that $12 million a year? Of course not. It is going to go to foreign crews working on foreign flag vessels, who will not pay any tax, not in Australia or anywhere else. End result: no gain; a phantom gain.

           Exactly the same type of thing is going to happen with the grant.

End result: zero sum game again.

           It is also worth while noting that the proposal to abolish the accelerated depreciation provisions is in effect a very clear breach of the government's commitment not to increase any taxes or to create any new taxes. It is very clear that what this will do is increase the tax being paid by Australian companies engaged in owning and operating ships. It is interesting to compare the accelerated depreciation provision with some of the things that apply in sectors that are the natural constituency—so&amp;hyphen;claimed—of the government: agricultural implements, 17 per cent; bulldozers, 20 per cent; harvesters, 20 per cent; general aircraft, 20 per cent; tractors and trucks, 20 per cent; and crop&amp;hyphen;dusting aircraft, 40 per cent. They all get accelerated depreciation. There are no question marks about any of that. That is not a problem. But, when it comes to Australian ships not run by constituents of the National Party, they cannot have

           The opposition strenuously opposes this bill. It is driven by blind ideology and by hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. It comes from a government which has so far shown itself to be completely devoid of any strategy at all for Australian shipping and for the maritime industry. Even the employers are saying that. The bill has minimal fiscal benefits for the budget because, when the grant goes, when the PAYE rebate goes, so does the tax revenue earned by the seafarers and so does the tax revenue that comes from the shipping companies to the government. The end result is a zero sum game. These measures are based on a perverted view that somehow certain sections of the Australian economy, certain parts of Australian society and of the community are entitled to be subsidised by other parts, are entitled to be assisted or entitled to be protected, but only if they support the National Party and the Liberal Party—only if they are their mates.

All we are interested in is the costs that apply to our mates. They can keep their subsidies, they can keep their assistance, but we are happy to deregulate everybody else.' The opposition is strongly opposed to this bill and will be voting against it both in the House and in the Senate.

        Let us look at the big issues that we are addressing here in the parliament. Should the taxpayers be funding handouts to particular industries? This industry is a case in point. Do we say that special grants would aid competitiveness? The shipping industry is a classic case where grants continue to be given to the shipping industry and the waterside workers, yet competitiveness has steadily declined. Taking the position of the US wheat industry, have handouts and subsidies improved the competitiveness of that industry? Likewise, in European agriculture, have the handouts by the taxpayers—some $US50 to $US60 billion—improved the competitiveness of those industries?

        Given that four per cent of our international trade is conducted in Australian flag ships, the arguments of the shadow minister at the table are somewhat lacking.

        As most of us would know, most Australian shipowners are vertically integrated industrial companies, such as BHP, Shell and Caltex. The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996 undoes the grants implemented last year to Australian shipowners engaged in international trade. Members of this House would well recall the arguments when these grants were paid as part of a peace deal brokered to end
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the Maritime Union strike in 1994 over the sale of ANL.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was a lot of debate throughout the nation, and the strong and leveraged position of the Maritime Union was used on that occasion. The strike resulted in an estimated 200 ships being stuck in Australian ports for five days just over this comparatively minor matter. According to the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the cost of that strike to the shipping industry was approximately $55 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The peace deal initially involved a PAYE tax exemption for seafarers, but Treasury had second thoughts and convinced the government to actually pay the grants to the shipowners, for simplicity and transparency. Again, the shadow minister at the table would well recall those arguments when the former Minister for Transport got up day after day in this parliament and expounded the virtues of this deal. Of course, in the final analysis the Treasury would not come clean on it and there was another backdoor way of implementing it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These grants were the equivalent of nominal income tax payable on the earnings of seafarers serving on the ship. Another part of the deal was to strive for further efficiencies in international shipping. Again, they were pies in the skies, given the circumstances. Another element was the peace accord to minimise industrial disputation. Just after we had had a major strike on the waterfront, there is this deal between the former minister, Laurie Brereton, and the MUA and the other maritime unions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, the MUA took the action of a national strike to support 75 striking workers at CRA. That was their next move—so much so that they brought the nation to a standstill because of the activities at Weipa. The shadow minister should be well acquainted with the fact that, during the recent federal election, voters at Weipa voted very strongly to support the coalition. What a remarkable turn of events. Having held the nation to ransom, they in fact voted for this side of the parliament and not the other side.

        The budgetary cost of these grants is estimated at $52 million. This was the sort of
        <break page="971" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         deal that the former minister was prepared to do to get out of a bit of a hole. The grants cost about $90 million last year, and this amount basically went to the shipowners. In order to be eligible for the grant, the ship must spend the majority of its time in international trade.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There are 21 shipowners and 78 Australian owned and registered ships. That is a comparatively small number in view of the amount of international trade that Australia conducts. Of these ships, 31 are sufficiently involved in international shipping to receive the payment. I would be interested to know how they make the judgment: how do you define those ships that are in international waters and those that travel on domestic routes?

       <para first-indent="16">
        BHP is the largest shipowner in Australia, and others are oil companies such as Mobil, Shell, BP and Caltex, and ANL as well. There are two important things to remember: first, only four per cent of international trade goes into and out of Australia on Australian ships; and, secondly, most Australian shipping companies are vertically integrated industrial companies: BHP, Shell—one ship based at Geelong—BP and Caltex, and CSR in the sugar industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The grants were paid to the shipowners in respect of between 1,000 to 1,200 Australian seafarers. There are not really many personnel involved, but there is a lot of money involved. The money does not flow to the seafarers themselves, but they benefit from the grants because it makes them easy to employ. On the one hand, you have a bribe to get the people back to work and, on the other hand, you give the money to shipowners. That is a strange way to do business, and I would be interested to know how the shadow minister at the table can defend that position.

        I looked at some of the details of these pooling labour systems, as they have worked on the waterfront, in the shipping industry.

        The ratings—crew members—are part of the industry pool, which we have been trying to get away from. Even the member for Shortland would appreciate that. These ratings are called marine cooks, marine stewards—a seaman's engagement type system. It is written in the award that they have these pooling type systems. The shipping companies are responsible for paying the ratings while they are on the ship and while they are on leave, which they take after their six months. The ratings, after their period of leave, go back into the industry pool for relocation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I thought all of us on both sides of the House were looking to change that pooling arrangement, because we know the devastating effect it has on the waterfront.

        If you look at the strike arrangements on the waterfront and the shipping industry now under the MUA, you see that there is a very strong connection between those groups. If one group is not getting its way, it encourages the other group to support it. Over the last three or four years we have seen the activities of the MUA on the waterfront and nationally.

A survey of international shippers found that Australia was the second worst country in the world for strikes affecting shipping and that 23 per cent of the strikes which affected international shipping originated in Australia. That is the figure as reported by this international newsletter; a figure which most people in Australia would come to understand as being true and correct. The recent activities of the MUA really indicate their muscle. Comments last week to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicate that they are prepared to use their particular type of industrial muscle to achieve any outcome they think is to their benefit.

        I draw the attention of the House to some of the recommendations which I think stand up to debate on both sides of the House. The shipbuilding industry in Australia, as we observed it, had some problems, but it was
        <break page="973" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         certainly not the taxpayers' dollars that would make it more efficient or world competitive. As the honourable member at the table would recall, we looked at the aluminium construction in Devonport, we looked at the Anzac frigate ship construction by Amecon at Williamstown and we noted that the 1988 Industries Assistance Commission concluded that the bounty enabled industry to enter export markets but did not encourage a viable, efficient industry. They are very telling words.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Another comment was that the provision of capital to the shipping industry was a problem. As the shadow minister at the table would well recall, we had a number of discussions with shipbuilding industry leaders about the problem of obtaining capital for shipbuilding on a world basis. Other nations around the world were getting subsidies from governments and cheap loans at low interest rates. That was a major impediment to the Australian shipping industry—especially at that time, when interest rates were in the range of 23 per cent. They pointed out to us that that was a very great difficulty.

        In terms of training, this committee thought naval architecture was something that needed to be improved. We were impressed with the state-of-the-art training of naval architects here in Australia, in both the smaller and the larger shipping industries. The level of skills and understanding that was displayed there was very encouraging for the development of the industry.

        Another factor in the whole argument was the encouragement coming from the Department of Defence towards the Australian shipbuilding industry. The key element here was whether Defence would place orders and help develop an efficient Australian shipbuilding industry, as they did with the Anzac frigate project in joint venture with New Zealand. That starting point from Defence, with the setting up of the contract for the six frigates, meant that systems were developed, capital was invested in that Williamstown dockyard and ships of world quality were produced and will continue to be produced.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The committee members were particularly impressed with the change in the new modu lar construction. All of us well recall our visit to the Williamstown dockyards and the changes that were taking place in computer aided design. What was more important was the contribution by Dr John White, the then manager of those dockyards, and the remarkable change in the industrial relations climate. That change was brought about by the good management of Amecon and the workers' dramatic change in attitude towards their relationship with management. I wish to put on the record my pleasure in and keenness for those changes that took place. They turned around what was formerly a hopeless situation.

        The committee produced a number of arguments about the position of the shipbuilding industry in Australia. The position of the industry depended very much on a change in industrial relations, and that change was clearly demonstrated in the Amecon shipyard. It depended on innovative technology—such as the technology that was introduced in the aluminium shipbuilding industry both in Tasmania and in Cairns—and it depended upon new and innovative designs. The catamarans that were produced in Tasmania have now found a niche market internationally and, whilst there have been some teething problems with one or two of them, they are now selling in Europe and in North America. That is a great feather in the cap of the shipbuilding industry in Australia and is something that all Australians and all members of this House should be proud of.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The thrust of what I am saying is that it will not be taxpayers' dollars that will make the shipbuilding industry efficient—there will be relatively benign taxation regimes. The availability of finance, the entrepreneurship of shipbuilders and the dramatic change in industrial relations which the Howard government will produce will put the Australian shipbuilding industry on its feet. The efficiency in this industry will not come from the subsidies that this bill is proposing, including the subsidisation of ANL.

         We had a protracted debate about these matters when the parliament last sat, and I essentially covered these issues at that time. Although it was not a cognate debate, by indulgence I was given the opportunity to make some general remarks. Those remarks obviously canvassed the importance of committees as the government sees them. We are keen to see the committees established. There has been substantial debate about representation on the committees. For the information of the House, I advise that the committee structure generally has followed the conventions of this House, so representation is on the basis of the numbers in the House—in other
         <break page="975" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         By indulgence, I wish to comment on one related matter. There has been some debate as to whether or not members of the opposition should be included as a requirement in any quorum. If I can refer to this issue now, I will then not need to refer to it upon the moving of the amendments. There is no precedent for that. That has never been the situation in the House. Obviously, where a notice of a meeting is given, that notice is given to all members of the committee and they have every right to be there in attendance. On that basis, obviously we will not be accepting that unprecedented proposal. The committee structure works quite well.

         I also think that generally committees have not operated on such a party political basis. They have attempted to draw on the merits of the issues rather than draw on party political views. For that reason, we will not be accepting such a proposal. I otherwise commend the motion to the House.

If the parliament is to be supreme, why is it that parliament is being denied the opportunity to deal with the detailed amendments that go to the core of our concern, yet that was the first thing that the government ruled us out on? The second thing I might add is the convention—which I think is longstanding in this place—whereby matters of public importance belong to the opposition of the day, not to the non&amp;hyphen;government parties. Yet we had a Deputy Speaker calling an Independent member to second an MPI that we had proposed on gun laws.

          The third area is that the Leader of the House has made great play of the extra number of questions that have been taken by the government in the course of question time. He boasted proudly of the fact that in the last sitting fortnight they had had 24 questions in each session. Questions they may have been; answers we did not get. In all circumstances, we are still waiting for the answers. If we are going to lift the status of

He then proceeded to gag the debate on the committees. What was gagged through were the committees that had been set up for the House of Representatives. We only dealt with one of the joint committees, that is, committees that are comprised of membership of both this House and the Senate, but we had the gagging of our attempt to move amendments in relation to the joint committees.

We set up an integrated system of committees that shadowed what were in those days the larger portfolio groupings.

Ministers in the past have used the parliamentary committee system to address issues that may have been too difficult for the executive government to deal with and too expensive for a commission of inquiry or something like that to deal with. My colleague the member for Cunningham will no doubt expand on that.

We expanded the size of some committees from time to time—the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade comes to mind. At the time we expanded it we increased the government membership and the opposition membership.

Obviously if there were no problem with this, he could accept the amendments of the member for Hotham. But the reality is that this is one of the greatest ramps that has been run through this place.

What we have here is the government not willing to let the opposition participate in the system, and the government really sowing the seeds for the destruction of the committee system. What you will find with these people is that they will get out there with a quorum of three and they will come down with little reports of their own, and then we will have a series of minority reports.

           The one good thing about the system in this parliament was that there were very few minority reports from the committees of the House of Representatives. Both sides worked together; there were very few. If the government will allow a quorum system where a report can come down with three government members meeting in the Chief Government Whip's office, it will destroy the system. You ought to think seriously about it. All we are asking for is a fair go, a bit of justice and a bit of equity.

          As somebody who has an interest as a member in committee work, I must say that the amendments proposed by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), in my view, would detract from the work of the committee. In fact, if you think about it carefully, the requirement to have an opposition member in the subcommittee or as a part of the quorum of a subcommittee could well sabotage the work of a committee.

          You could make sure that a subcommittee never effectively gets a quorum, particularly if it is looking at something that perhaps the opposition party may not have an interest in looking at very closely or, for instance, does not suit their particular political objectives. It may well be looking at some legislation, for instance. There may be times when legislation is referred to a committee for the—

It is with great reluctance and some hesitation that I take this point of order, because I felt that when the Leader of the House first rose to move that the question be put you actually had seen me stand before him but gave him the call. I regret that this is now the second time that you have appeared to see me standing but have chosen to give the call to the Leader of the House. My point of order is that you should have given me the call, Mr Deputy Speaker.

           —The opposition has a clear tactic. We could have had the opportunity tonight for opposition members to speak to these motions and we were quite happy to do so. I noticed that one of the speakers during the earlier debate said that we had rammed these matters through. The truth is that we put time aside when parliament sat 10 days ago. The opposition set out to spend the whole time in divisions to prevent their own people speaking to the motions so that they could then stand up and say we were undermining our own pledge in respect of parliamentary standards. It is absolutely incredible.

The whole basis of their claim is that they do not like the proportions of members on the committees. The fact is that the proportions on the committees are a direct reflection of the numbers in the House—which are, of course, a direct reflection of the way in which the people voted in the 2 March election. So what they don't like is the election result. They think this is a good basis on which to run a series of divisions.

I have read the debate from back in 1987 when we established the committees. We had 39&amp;half; minutes of constructive discussion about the establishment of the committees and that was, as I say, a turning point with a new committee structure.

We are not proceeding with the committee of which the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has been chairman. He is entitled to have his say. But for the moving of this procedural motion, quite frankly, he would not have had that opportunity. By moving this particular procedural motion, at least the House can have half an hour or thereabouts discussing these issues and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who also wants to speak, can have his say. Your childish pranks at running a filibuster come to naught. I therefore commend this procedural motion to the House.

           —We oppose the suspension of the standing orders. The reasons advanced by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) are completely fatuous. To argue that this House has had the opportunity to debate these issues on the establishment of committees is nonsense. These motions were first introduced into this House at 5 o'clock on the last sitting Thursday. The gag was moved before 5.30—half an hour of debate to establish eight House of Representatives standing committees. Is that a proper course of action? Does that demonstrate a commitment to the supremacy of the parliament over his executive decision as to what the constitution will be? He tries to come into this place and say there should be ample time for debate, but only 40 minutes was allowed tonight.

          So, in total, in establishing all of these committees we have had a little over an hour of debate. Do you know how long it has taken to actually get the first one carried by voting procedures? More time than enabled us to have a debate. More time was spent on procedures because of your arrogance, because of your ignoring the form of the House and because of your trying to deny the opposition the opportunity to move amendments, and this is what you have got. The fact of the matter is that it is not correct to say that the opposition has voted the committees down. What we have voted down is your ability to conduct secret meetings under the guise of parliamentary committees.

          You have introduced procedures into this House whereby a committee can comprise three people or two people. You can have your secret meetings in a telephone box or in the corridor. There is no requirement for anyone in the opposition parties or on the opposition side to comprise that quorum. Yet when we talk about the joint committees where there is a requirement not just to take account of our position on this side of the House, the opposition in the House, what about the Senate? Don't you consider it part of the joint process? Yet it has standing orders—standing orders that require an opposition member to comprise the quorum.

The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) would have told you, if you had deigned to ask in your oratory ecstasy, when you were laughing your way through the processes of this parliament, that the parliamentary committee system in the House of Representatives commenced in 1972. For you to be pontificating as an authority does you and your party no credit.

           —Madam Deputy Speaker, any pretence by this government that they are paying homage to the parliament has been shot to pieces in their first two and a bit sitting weeks. The changes to parliamentary committees which they rammed through this place—to the advantage of the government without even a pretence of consultation with the opposition—is just one case in point.

          Of course, it is not only the opposition; the other non-government members have been ignored entirely. By default or compliance, the opposition have been a party to that. Perhaps they might consider their position on that some time when they are all getting overawed with democracy. You could be forgiven for thinking that the government's professed commitment to reinvigorating parliamentary practices was merely a euphemism for revenge—revenge on the parliamentary Labor Party which, I must say, was equally ruthless in using its numbers in government.

           gag on one occasion over the last 12 to 18 months. Having reorganised the way this parliament approaches its business, they did not, to the best of my recollection, resort to the gag. The very first piece of legislation this government has put through the House of Representatives had a gag on it. That is an indication of things to come. It is an indictment of the government, but the chap at the table who giggles and squiggles his way through this debate deserves the greatest condemnation.

         This motion goes to the very heart of the issue which we are considering here tonight: quorum requirements for committees which are established. This amendment seeks simply to have two of the six members forming a quorum for this committee to be from the opposition. It is not an unrealistic ask. It is not in the broad scheme of things asking too much.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) made a number of comments a little earlier in respect of this whole issue of committees, and I would like to add one or two points to those comments he addressed to the House. Firstly, I wish to pick up the point as to why, for example, an amendment which increases the number of opposition members associated with committee work is of great value. Comments were made, and I think at one stage the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) interjected and asked what would the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) know about the workings of committees in this place. I can tell the member for Corangamite that I know a little about that, having for nearly the 12 years I have been here, save the three years I was Speaker, served on many of those committees and having been a Speaker who felt the committee system served this parliament very well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          I know the honourable member for Corangamite has an interest in committees, because he worked closely with me on a number of committees in recent years. I say to the honourable member that, through committees, we can achieve a reasonable outcome in this parliament. For example, I chaired the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Admin istration and, in my view, this committee demonstrates very clearly the way in which the committee system can assist the parliamentary process. In the course of this committee's inquiries, 14 reports were done on a variety of subjects. For instance, there was a review of the Australian banking industry, which resulted in something like 108 recommendations of which, I think, 105 were adopted by government. There were inquiries into the Australian Customs Service, sports funding and administration—which still is the basic parameter by which sports funding in this country from the federal government's perspective is planned—and tax evasion, offshore tax havens and so on.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In every one of those cases, bar one, there was bipartisan support for those reports. The only minor dissenting report came from the then honourable member for Boothby who, for some reason, did not like one of the recommendations we put forward in the banking inquiry. The rest of those 14 committee reports involved important issues: tax evasion, regulation of the Australian banking industry, the Australian Customs Service and the way it supports this country at the barrier, sports funding and so on. All of those issues were approached from a bipartisan perspective.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you are going to throw all of that away, if you are going to throw away everything that has happened in the committee system that has been augmented and supplemented particularly since 1987 to specifically give backbenchers something to do, then you have to support what the government is proposing. But if you want to maintain backbench interest, if you want to maintain genuine support from the opposition so the bipartisan nature of inquiries can be pursued without the nonsense that goes on in a partisan fashion when you are chasing a minister down a rabbit hole or whatever over a specific issue, if you want to make a contribution in this place, then you support the sensible amendment that the opposition is proposing.

          would like to see government do both in this place and out in the broad community. But committees actually do that. If we can get bipartisan support for committee recommendations, would it not make the government's job just a little bit easier? Is it not a worthwhile process, if we have opposition members supporting majority committee reports which are brought down and recommended to the government? But, if the opposition are shut out because quorum requirements are brought in, whereby government members—and only two of them at that—can get together in secret, in private, and can have a yarn about some recommendations and then put them forward, does the opposition participate in a fair and reasonable way?

         I might just say something about the broad thrust of this. I am sorry the clerk has actually ducked out. It would surprise me if the clerk does not have a view about the committee system in this place and has not made that view known to the government of the day. It would surprise me if he did not say to the Leader of the House that setting up committees is a great opportunity for backbenchers, both government and opposition, to participate, provided the committees are resourced properly.

         I would be surprised also if the clerk has not suggested to the Leader of the House and others that they seriously consider this when coming up with some options for the $2 million savings that are going to be imposed on the Department of the House of Representatives, not to mention—as we are talking about joint committees—the $2 million also in the Department of the Senate. Have members on the government side—those that have been here for a while and those who have been on committees—actually sat down and thought what it means to have the government of the day say to the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate—forgetting the other departments for the moment; I am only concerned about these because we are talking about committees—`By the way, you are going to have to find $2 million worth of savings,' at the same time saying to the government and the parliament, `We want to have an enhanced committee system but we are not going to give you the resources'?

And I will stand up in any forum in this country or elsewhere—and indeed I have—to say that the committee system of the parliament of Australia is amongst the best in the world because of its participatory nature and what it gives people in this place a chance to do. But the difficulty that you are always going to be faced with is: if you have a large number of people on one side of the parliament, how do you keep them all happy? The simple way is to say, `Let's create a few more committees. Let us send them all over Australia and give them a couple of inquiries. Do not give the resources

         If it is not there, the question needs to be asked, Mr Deputy Speaker—as I am sure you and your colleague the Speaker will be asking yourselves in the coming weeks—`Where else can we find those savings?' I am sorry to say that I think it is going to be in services provided to members in this place. I think it is going to fall largely on members' services. It is already going to fall on committee staff; that is as clear as day. There is no doubt about that from this motion proposed by the government tonight on all of these committees.

         Did the government listen? No. One of the things we are going to debate here a little later is starting up a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Why couldn't that have been done in the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade? Why did you have to create another committee? Is it because the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) suddenly missed out on getting a job somewhere, so you have to have a committee for him?

         What does that do in spreading resources that are already stretched in the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate to meet the needs of members and senators in this place so they can do their job of representing the people of Australia?

         Is that really what this committee system has come to in this place? I genuinely hope not because, as I said, the committee system in this parliament, since 1987 particularly—as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) knows—has served this place well. All those sorts of inquiries over the long time that committees have been conducted in this parliament have been an outstanding success.

         Ministers in this place, past and present, probably do not like the idea of some of these committee inquiries because inquiries suddenly find out a few things that maybe should have been done a bit better.

         I am talking about only one amendment that has been proposed, but this goes to the very heart of our committee system. If we are talking about the bipartisan nature of the committees and about having meaningful inquiries which the government of the day refers to those committees for investigation so that any legislation that might come as a result of those inquiries goes through this place much more smoothly, doesn't it make a lot of sense to try to smooth that passage? Doesn't it make a lot of sense to say that if we can give the quorum requirements some sense of balance and fairness, where the opposition and the Independent members get a fair go, the committee system will operate more effectively in this parliament?

         Sadly, the Leader of the House does not think so. He has invoked strange sorts of proposals. He is cutting out the role of the opposition and Independent members and their responsibility to participate. It is rather sad because most people in this place who have been here for a time like to believe that the committee system works effectively and makes a valuable contribution. It goes to the issue which the Prime Minister has talked about, the primacy of the parliament over the executive. The committee system in this parliament goes to that sense of primacy—and it should always do so.

          I said in an earlier contribution that I thought it would be great if the Speaker and the government would look at providing the committees with a new position so that graduates could take up a one&amp;hyphen;year contract. For example, honours graduates from different universities could come to the committees, learn about the committee system, get the benefit of all that experience and make a great contribution to the committee system, with committees utilising their skills. They could then go on to the job of their choice, but credentialled with 12 months experience of working in the parliamentary committee system. This would be one way of trying to maximise the resources available to the committees. But there is absolutely nothing from the government about that.

         In recent decades there have been many significant changes in the law and among them is its increasing internationalisation. Treaties are an integral part of this process of globalisation. However, under successive Labor governments there developed a sense of inevitability and an almost indecent haste in the manner in which Australia joined treaties. It was not so much a case of `If you can't beat them, join them' but more a sense of being left behind or losing influence if Australia did not join a major multilateral treaty soon after its adoption.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When in opposition, the current government and the Australian community were concerned that adequate scrutiny, both of the obligations under treaties and of their effects on Australia, was being sacrificed in the quest for speedy ratification. The treaty making practices of the previous government were geared
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          towards such expedition. Indeed, the speed with which Australia could become a party to a treaty was promoted as a virtue in itself.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This quest for speed meant there was an absence of openness and also inadequate parliamentary and community involvement in the treaty process. Comprehensive information about treaties was also hard to come by. When it was made available, it was frequently after Australia became a party to a treaty rather than before. The results were suspicion and misunderstanding about treaties, both in the community and in state and territory governments, and also less than ideal implementation of certain treaties in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that treaties do bring benefits to the Australian community. However, the treaty making process adopted by the previous government acted to undermine rather than promote those benefits. A matter of particular concern to the government was the inadequacy of the parliamentary involvement in the treaty process. The only role of any significance which parliament had previously was in the passage of legislation to implement certain treaties. However, this was a role which was limited by the content of the treaty obligations. It was also limited by the fact that many of the important treaties to which Australia becomes a party do not require implementing legislation.

         It is not as though the coalition was alone in calling for greater parliamentary involvement in the treaty process. Justice Michael Kirby, then President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, in a Department of the Senate occasional lecture last year stated:

         It therefore seems legitimate, in some way, now to involve the national parliament in the superintendence of executive action in respect of treaties.

         Reform of the treaty making process and, in particular, strengthening the role of parliament in that process was an integral part of the government's pre&amp;hyphen;election law, justice and foreign affairs policies. The importance which the government places upon these reforms is evidenced by the swiftness of their implementation. The new treaty making process was announced in both houses of parliament on 2 May, the third sitting day of the new parliament. On the same day the government responded in detail to the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Trick or treaty? Commonwealth power to make and implement treaties
         </emphasis>
         , that is, within five sitting days of the tabling of the report on 29 November 1995—a pace rarely matched by the honourable members opposite when in government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A key element of the government's moves to give the parliament a greater role in relation to treaties is the establishment of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, this being the subject of one of the motions under debate. The motion to establish that committee is similar to that which I tabled in the House of Representatives in November last year. It would require the committee to report on matters arising from treaties and related national interest analyses presented to the parliament, any question relating to a treaty or other international instrument referred to the committee by either house of the parliament or a minister and such other matters as may be referred to the committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to the numbers on the committee from the government and the opposition side, the numbers in the present motion reflect exactly the motion that I moved in opposition. In other words, we do not see any different situation in government from what we saw in opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The principal issue for the joint standing committee will be whether it would be in Australia's interest for it to become a party to a treaty. In order to reach a conclusion on that issue, the committee will need to analyse the implications for Australia of it becoming a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          party to a particular treaty. In so doing, the committee will be assisted by the national interest analysis, which will be tabled with each of the treaties. This national interest analysis is yet another innovation resisted with fervour by the previous government.

         An inquiry into a proposed convention would also provide an opportunity for examination of whether appropriate action had been taken or was being taken in relation to any legislation required to implement the convention. Indeed, the commitment to ensuring legislation to implement treaties is in place prior to taking binding treaty action is another core element of the government's treaty policy. It is a point worthy of elaboration in a few moments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Very few people would forget the breathtaking arrogance of the previous government in 1992 in its ratifying ILO convention 158, concerning termination of employment at the initiative of the employer. Very few people would also assert that ratification of that convention was a necessary consequence of the process of globalisation, which I mentioned earlier. Rather, the sole purpose of ratification was to obtain constitutional power in an area which was previously the province of the states. The current government accepts that additional constitutional power may be a consequence of becoming a party to a treaty. However, it does not accept that a decision to become a party to a treaty should be motivated solely by the additional constitutional power thereby gained.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ratification of ILO convention 158 is also the most blatant example of the disregard of the previous government for the need to have implementing legislation in place prior to the ratification of a treaty—that is, the sensible practice that Australia should not become a party to a treaty and thereby accept obligations under that treaty until it has legislation and practice in place to enable it to give effect to the treaty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The basic reason for this practice is that, where legislation—be it Commonwealth or state—is necessary to give effect to the provisions of a treaty, it cannot be anticipated that the relevant legislature will pass the legislation. If Australia became a party to a
         <break page="1006" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          treaty on the assumption that certain implementing legislation would be passed and it was not, then Australia would be left in breach of the treaty. This can be particularly embarrassing if there is no provision for withdrawal from it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The cavalier approach adopted by the previous government to the timing of implementing legislation seemed at odds with the importance which it claimed it placed on compliance with its international obligations. In stark contrast, the Howard government will ensure that the necessary legislation and practice—be they state or federal—are in place prior to the taking of the relevant binding treaty action. The national interest analysis will address that question specifically and, as I noted earlier, it is one of the issues which will be considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia becomes a party to many treaties each year. The proposed joint standing committee could not conduct full inquiries into all of them. For example, many treaties, such as bilateral air services agreements, investment protection agreements and double taxation agreements, are of the template variety—that is, the fundamental provisions of each of these agreements remain the same, irrespective of the country with whom they are made. Such treaties are likely to gain bipartisan support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Undoubtedly the joint standing committee will develop procedures for determining whether a more detailed examination of particular treaties is desirable. Nevertheless, the opportunity for the committee to look at every treaty is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of the committee's role and in ensuring adequate scrutiny by this parliament.

          In conclusion, I reiterate that parliamentary consideration of treaties in the past has been hampered by a lack of information on treaties and by the absence of an opportunity to consider and debate the merits of treaties before Australia took binding treaty action. Given the increasing influence of treaties over matters of concern to the Australian people, these constraints on the participation of parliament were a blight on the democratic process. The recent changes introduced by the government will remove those constraints.

          The tabling of treaties with adequate opportunity for debate prior to ratification, together with consideration of those treaties by a joint treaties committee, the subject of one of these motions, will ensure that the Commonwealth parliament is no longer informed only after the event. It will now have a well-defined and effective role in the treaty making process. I commend that particular motion to the House.

The expectation the government has created in the community is that somehow they are going to have treaties discussed in the community and then bring them into parliament. Of course, it is the other way around. The government will sign them first and then tokenistically drop into the parliament and say, `By the way, here they are.'

         A great disappointment has come from this whole debate during last week and this week. For some years the backbenchers on both sides of this parliament fought and worked very hard to expand our committee system. There was a bipartisan approach to that because we felt it was important and that we had a greater role to play. Many of us have been on a number of committees across a range of areas in a number of parliaments. In those committees we have had members from both sides of the House put forward recommendations to the parliament that were not the policies of any of their parties. That has happened time and again.

         Looking at the numbers, the stacking and the way the quorums work, committees are basically a charade. That really is a tragedy. What we find is that, when we have hearings and discussions around Australia, we hear the same people and we read the same documents. It is remarkable how often we come to similar conclusions, if we are open minded. Creating committees in this climate and in this way means we will not be open minded; we will be closed minded.

         These committees have been created politically as a creature of the executive, and they will function that way. That last speech absolutely confirms it. That speech was not a speech about the parliament; it was a speech about politics. That is why it was so disgraceful. Creating a committee in that context and for that purpose is purely a political process. The committees that the previous government created, and which we debated in these last

         Ten years ago we thought that we created a committee system that was a great breakthrough.

The vengeance that is coming through from the government now is being borne by these committees, which are not part of the problem. They could have been part of the solution, building the credibility of this parliament. That potential has been destroyed tonight and I think many of you will live to regret it. This is just one of many things: revolt on Mabo; revolt on guns; revolt on chicken meat—but forget the committees because, in your view, they are not very important.

         However, I wanted to make a couple of observations in the debate on specific parts of the motion. In particular, I refer the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to motion 5 on the proposed Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority. I refer to paragraph (p), which states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         That, in carrying out its duties, the committee or any subcommittee, ensure that the operational methods and results of investigations of law enforcement agencies, as far as possible, be protected from disclosure where that would be against the public interest.

         Having been a member of the joint standing committee for six years in the two previous parliaments, I am a little concerned about the necessity for this provision because it may nobble the committee further.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee, as we know, since its inception has had a particular problem in the statutory provisions that created it. That problem happens to be the fact that, in fulfilling its role as the oversight committee of the National Crime Authority, the joint standing committee is at times unable to get the information that it needs to do its job properly. That has been a continual source of concern in the activities of the committee. Paragraph (p) would compound that problem and would make it almost impossible at times for the committee to do its job properly. That is why I am very concerned and interested in hearing any responses that the Leader of the House may care to give on that paragraph.

         The opportunity for the committee to hear information from the authority around its operational methods and, for instance, specific investigations is already limited by the National Crime Authority Act, which not only created the committee but also limited the information that the committee was able to elicit from the National Crime Authority members.

In the last parliament the effectiveness of the joint standing committee, unfortunately, was limited. It is a very important committee. We have seen in recent times attacks on and instances involving the National Crime Authority. These instances have generated much concern in the community.

          Quite clearly there is an expectation in the community that, where you have a joint standing committee that has the oversight of the authority, there should be at least one place where their representatives can do something about it. The problem is that, if we are further constrained by this provision of standing orders, the joint standing committee's effectiveness will be limited. I for one would like to see that explained—but I would rather see it withdrawn.

          In conclusion, I would like to make the observation that we still are yet to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement for Independent members in debates and, most importantly, in the nomination to committees. We have asked the Speaker and the government to do something about it. The Speaker referred it back to the House—to the government and the opposition—but they have failed to do anything about it. We are not opposition members; we are non&amp;hyphen;government members. We have our own rights to represent our interests and constituents' interests as we see fit.

           It is quite inappropriate for us to be considered as some adjunct to the opposition. It is not just a matter for an arrangement between the Chief Opposition Whip and the Chief Government Whip as to how the memberships of those committees be consti tuted; it should be done by arrangement. Certainly, in that case we ought to be consulted and given the opportunity to have our input.
